Editors' Professor The object of this series of translations is primarily to furnish students with short, cheap, and handy text books, which it is hoped will facilitate the study of the particular text and class under competent teachers. But it is also hoped that the volumes will be acceptable to the general reader, who may be interested in the subjects with which they deal. It has been thought advisable as a general rule to restrict the notes and comments to a small compass. More especially as in most cases, excellent works of a more elaborate character are available. Indeed, it is much to be desired that these translations may have the effect of inducing readers to study the larger works. Our principal aim, in a word, is to make some difficult texts, important for the study of Christian origins, more generally accessible in faithful and scholarly translations. In most cases, these texts are not available in a cheap and handy form. In one or two cases, texts have been included of books which are available in the official Apakrafa, but in every such case, reasons exist for putting forth these texts in a new translation, with an introduction in this series. W-O-E-O-E-O-sterly, GH-Box. Introduction, the Apocalyptic Literature. As the book of Enek is, in some respects, the most notable extent apocalyptic work outside the canonical scriptures, it will not be inappropriate to offer a few remarks here on the Apakaliptic Literature generally. In writing about the books which belong to this literature, Professor Berkett says very pointedly, that they are the most characteristics survival of what I will venture to call, with all its neuroness and its incoherence, the heroic age of Jewish history. The age when the nation attempted to realize in action, the part of the peculiar people of God. It ended in catastrophe, but the nation left two successors, the Christian Church and the rabbinical schools, each of which carried on some of the old national aims. And of the two, it was the Christian Church that was most faithful to the ideas enshrined in the Apakalipses, and it did consider itself, not without some reason, the fulfillment of those ideas. What is wanted, therefore, in studying the Apakalipses, is above all, sympathy with the ideas that underlie them, and especially with the belief in the new age. And those who believe that in Christianity a new era of really did dawn for us ought, I think, to have that sympathy. We study the Apakalipses to learn how our spiritual ancestors, hoped again that God would make all right in the end. And that we, their children, are here today studying them, is an indication that their hope was not wholly unfounded. Hope is, indeed, the main underlying motive power, which prompted the writers of the Apakalipses, and this hope is the more intensive and ardent in that it shines forth from a background which is dark with despair. For the Apakalipses, despaired of the world in which they lived, a world in which the godly were of no account, while the wicked seemed too often triumphant and prosperous. With evil everywhere around, the Apakalipses saw no hope for the world as it was, for such a world there was no remedy, only the destruction. If the good were ever to try on if it must be in a new world, despairing therefore of the world around them, the Apakalipses centered their hope upon a world to come, whether righteous would come to their own, and evil would find no place. It is this thought which underlies the opening words of the book of Enic. The words of the blessing of Enic were with he bless the elect and righteous, who will be living in the day of tribulation when all the wicked and godless are to be removed. No wherein this book is the essence of this hope more beautifully expressed than in a short, magical piece in the first chapter. But with the righteous, he will make peace, and will protect the elect and mercy shall be upon them, and they shall all belong to God, and they shall all be prospered, and they shall all be blessed. And he will help them all, and lay shall appear unto them, and he will make peace with them, first Enic, one-eight. In all the books belonging to this literature which have come down to us, this hope is expressed more less vividly, nor is the dark background wanting with prophecies of coming ra. It will therefore be realized that the Apakalipsic literature is almost wholly concerned with the future. It is true that again and again the Apakalipsist glances at the contemporary history of the world around him, to which many e-acryptic references made, a fact which necessitates some knowledge of the history of this period, circa 200 BC through AD100. For a full understanding of the books in question, but these references are only made with view to comforting the oppressed and afflicted with the thought that even the most mighty of earthly powers are shortly to be overthrown by the advent of the new glorious era when every injustice and all the incongruities of life will be done away with. So that every reference to the present is merely a position taken up from which to point to the future. Now, since as we have seen the Apakalipsists despair of any bettering of the present world, and therefore contemplated its destruction as the preliminary of the new order of things, they look away from this world in their visions of the future. They conceive of other worldly forces coming into play in the reconstitution of things, and of society generally. And since these are other worldly forces, the supernatural plays a great part in the Apakalipsic literature. This supernatural coloring will often strike the reader of this literature as fantastic, and at times bizarre, but this should not be permitted to obscure the reality which often lies behind these weird shadows. Mental visions are not always easily expressed in words. The seer who in a vision has received a message in some fantastic guys necessarily has the impress upon his mind of what he has seen when giving his message. And when he describes his vision, the picture he presents is in the nature of the case, more fantastic to the ear of the hear than to the eye of him who saw it. Allow it should be made for this, especially by us Westerns who are so lacking in the rich imaginativeness of the Oriental. Our love of literalness hinders the play of the imagination because we are so apt to materialize a mental picture presented by another. The Apakalipses were written by and for orientals, and we cannot do just as to them unless we remember this, but it would be best if we could get into the Oriental mind and look at things from that point of view. Another thing which the reader of the Apakalip to glitterage are must be prepared for is the frequent inconsistency of thought to be found there. Together with variableness of teaching often involving contradiction. The reason of this is not to be sought simply in the fact that in the Apakalipses the hand of more than one author is frequently to be discerned. A fact which would easily account for divergence of views in one and the same book. Know the chief reason is that, on the one hand, the minds of the Apakalipdists were saturated with the traditional thoughts and ideas of the Old Testament. And on the other, they were eagerly absorbing the newer conceptions which the spirit of the age had brought in to be. This occasion to continual conflict of thought in their minds. The endeavor to harmonize the old and the new would not always succeed, and in consequence they are often resulted a compromise which was illogical and which presented contradictions. In consistency of teaching on certain points is therefore not surprising under the circumstances. Again to realize the significance of much that is found in these Apakalipses, one has to reckon with a rigid predestinarianism, which was characteristic of the Apakalipdists as a whole. They started with the absolute conviction that the whole course of the world from beginning to end, both as regards to its physical changes and also in all the concerns the history of nations, their growth and decline, and of every single individual was in every respect predetermined by God Almighty before all time. This belief of the Apakalipdists is well illustrated in one of the later Apakalipses by these words, for he have weighed the age in the balance, and by number and half he numbered the seasons, neither will he move nor stir things till the measure appointed be fulfilled. Second, asdres, 436 and 37. Thus, the times and periods of the course of the world's history have been predetermined by God. The numbers of the years have been exactly fixed. This was a fundamental postulates of the Apakalipdists who devoted much of their energy to calculations based upon a close study of prophecy as to the exact period when history should reach its consummation. The underlying idea is predestinary. But all these things, according to the Apakalipdists, were divine secrets hidden from the beginning of the world, but revealed to Godfaring men to whom was accorded the faculty of peering into the hidden things of God and of understanding them. Upon these men was laid the privilege and duty of revealing the divine secrets to others, hence their name of Apakalipdists or reviewers. It was because the Apakalipdists believed so firmly in this power which they possessed of looking into the deep things of God, that they claimed to be able to measure the significance of what had happened in the past, and of what was happening in the present. And upon the basis of this knowledge, they believed that they also had the power given them by God, of foreseen the march of future events. Above all, of knowing when the end of the world would come, a consummation towards which the whole history of the world had been tending from the beginning. In spite of all the mysticism, sometimes of a rather fantastic kind and of frequently Superman-dane vision, with which the Apakalipdic literature abounds, the Apakalipdists fully realized the need of practical religion. They were upholders of the law, the loyal observance of which they regard as an necessity for all God-fearing men. In this, the Apakalipdists were at one in principle, with puricism. But their conception of what constituted loyal observance of the law differed from that of the Pharisees. For unlike these, the Apakalipdists laid all stress on the spirit of its observance rather than upon the letter. Characteristic of their attitude here are the words in First-Denic chapter 5, verse 4. But ye, ye have not been steadfast nor done the commandments of the Lord, but ye have turned away and have spoken proud and hard words, with your impure mouths against his greatness, oh ye hard-hearted, you shall find no peace. And again, in 99, 2, woe to them that pervert the words of uprightness and transgress the eternal law. We do not find in this literature that insistence on the literal carrying out of the minutice precepts of the law, which was characteristic of Pharisees. Veneration for the law is wholehearted. It is the real guide of life. Honishment awaits those who ignore its guidance. But the fairs say a interpretation of the law and its requirements is alien to the spirit of the Apakalipdists. As a whole, the Apakalipdic literature presents and universalistic attitude very different from the nationalistic narrowness of the Pharisees. It is true that the Apakalipdists are not always consistent in this, but normally they embrace the Gentiles equally with the men of their own nation in the divine scheme of salvation. And in the same way, the wicked who are excluded are not restricted to the Gentiles, but the Jews equally with them shall suffer torment here after according to their desserts. The Apakalipdic literature, as distinct from the Apakalipdic movement, owing to which it took its rise, began to come into existence about the period of 200 to 150 BC. At any rate, the earliest extent example of this literature, the earliest portions of the book of Enek belongs to this period. Works of an Apakalipdic character continued to be written for about three centuries, the second fourth book of extras, one of the most remarkable Apakalipses, belongs to the end of the first Christian century, approximately. There are Apakalipses of later date, some of subordinate interests are of much later date, but the real period of the Apakalipdic literature is from about 200 BC to about AD 100. It's beginning to date, therefore, from a time prior to that great landmark in Jewish history, the Macabee and era. The book of Enek is component parts and their dates. The book of Enek is now usually designated first Enek to distinguish it from the later Apakalips the secrets of Enek, known as second Enek. The former is also called the Ethiopic Enek, the latter the Slovanic Enek, after the languages of the earliest versions extent of each respectively. No manuscript of the original language of either is known to be in existence. According to Canon Charles, the various elements of which our book in its present form is made up belong to different dates. The following table will show the dates of the different parts of the book. Can in Charles believes that these are approximately correct, without committing himself to the certainty of this in each case. Chapter 12 through 36, 42 and 91 and 12 through 17, the Apakalips of Weeks, the oldest pre-Macabee and portions. Chapter 6 through 107, fragments of the book of Noah, pre-Macabee and at the latest. Chapter 83 to 90, the dream-visions. 165 to 161 BC. Chapter 72 to 82, the book of the heavenly luminaries, before 110 BC. Chapter 37 to 71, 91, 1 to 11, 18, 19, through 104, the parables or similitudes. Chapter 15 to 64 BC. Chapter 15 through 5, the latest portion, but pre-Christian. Chapter 105, which consists of only two verses, cannot be dated. While Chapter 108 is in the nature of an appendix, probably added subsequently to the whole work. While these dates may be regarded as approximately correct, it should be pointed out that differences of opinion exist among scholars on the subject. Sureer holds, for example, that with the exception of chapters 37 through 71, the parables or similitudes, the entire book belongs to the period of 132 BC. The parables, he assigns, to a time not earlier than hered the Great. Beer thinks that the dream-visions chapters 83 through 90 belong to the time of John Herkiness, 135 to 105 BC, and he includes under the pre-Macabian portions, only 91, 12 through 17, 92, 93, 1 through 14, and holds that the rest of the book was written before 64 BC. Dumb and maintains that it cannot be proved that the important sections 37 through 71, the similitudes, is the product of the pre-Christian period, though he fully recognizes its Jewish character. Burke, it regards the writer as almost contemporary with the philosopher, Positonius, 135 to 51 BC. There is the sim diversity of opinion as to the date of the book among leading authorities. That it is, as a whole, pre-Christian, may be regarded as definitely established. More difficult is the question whether any portions of it are pre-Macabian. Charles gives various reasons for his belief that considerable parts are pre-Macabian. We are inclined to agree with him, though it may be questioned whether the last word on the subject has been spoken. Authorship. As the various parts of the book clearly belong to different dates, diversity of authorship is what one is naturally led to expect, and of this, there can indeed be no shadow of doubt. The author of the earliest portions was a Jew who lived as Burke at a shown in Northern Palestine, in the land of Dan, southwest of the Herman Range, near the headwaters of the Jordan. This is important as it tends to show that the book or books is really Palestinian, and one which, therefore, circulated among Jews in Palestine. If, more over, the author came from the north, that helps to explain the influence the book had upon the religion that was cradled in Galilee. Of the authors of the other three books of which Enak is made up, veased the dream-visions, the book of the heavenly luminaries and the similitudes, we know nothing save what can be gathered from their writings as to their religious standpoint. Charles holds that though there is not unity of authorship, there is nonetheless uniformity, for according to him all the books were written by Chassidam, or by their successors, the Pharisees. This contention has been strongly assailed and much weakened by Lesinski in a recent work on this agiesies. While frankly recognizing the composite character of the book, Lesinski holds that the original portions of it emanate from sadgesie and circles, and that this special object of the book originally was the bringing about of a reform of the calendar. He points to the description of the book to Enak as supporting his contention. For Enak lived 365 years, I.e. is years correspond to the number of days in the solar year. The basis of reckoning time was one of the fundamental points of difference between the Pharisees and Sadgesies, for whereas the former reckoning time by the lunar year 360 days, the latter did so by the solar year. Here is a significant remark of Berkitz's worth recalling. In writing about the false titles given to all the apocalyptic books he says, there is another aspect of Sadanam's authorship, to which I venture to think sufficient attention has not been given. It is this, that the names were not chosen out of mere caprice. They indicated to a certain extent what subjects would be treated and the point of view of the writer. Further, the fact that Enak walked with God, and he was not for God to Kim, I.e. that he ascended into the heavens, is also significant, for he would thereby be just the one to know all about the heavenly luminaries. He was just the most appropriate author of a book which was to deal with astronomical questions. The Sadgesie and character of the original work says Lizinski, is seen most clearly in the discussion regarding the calendar. Chapter 72 through 82, are rightly called the book of astronomy. The book of the courses of the luminaries of the heaven, the relations of each according to their classes, their dominion and their seasons, according to their names and places of origin, and according to their months. With regard to all the years of the world and unto eternity till the new creation is accomplished, which endureeth till all eternity. 72, one. That sounds almost as though the author of the book of Jubilee's had written it. That it is not a merely scientific interest which impels the writer to give expression to his astronomical theories, may be seen from the words of the conclusion of the section. Blessed are all the righteous, blessed are all those who walk in the way of righteousness, and sin not as the sinners in the reckoning of all their days, in which the sun treverseth the heaven, entering into and departing from the portals for 30 days. 82. Versus 4 through 7. Herein, one can discern quite clearly the tendency of the writer. He desires the adoption of the solar year, while his contemporaries for only followed a different reckoning, and therefore is celebrated the feasts at the wrong time. The sinners who sin in the reckoning of the year are the Pharisees, and the righteous ones who are blessed, the Zatakum, who walk upon the paths of righteousness, Zedak. As the name is made to imply are the sadgises. The points may appear small to us, but we may compare it with the quarter-dessum and controversy in the church during the second century. It is at any rate, a strong point in favor of the sadgisean authorship of the book of the heavenly luminaries. The pre-macabian portions assuming that some portions of it are pre-macabian, of the book of Enek, must certainly be ascribed to the chastitum. But it is not on that account necessary to ascribe all the later portions to the Pharisees. Three points especially militate against this. Some of the teaching concerning the Messiah, the generally speaking universalistic spirit, which is quite unfairseic, and the attitude towards the law, which is not that of the Pharisees. It is not to be denied that some portions, e.g. 102, 6, and following are from the hands of Pharisees. Nor can it be doubted that the whole collection in its present form has been worked over by a Pharisee, or Pharisees. But that all the post-macabian portions in their original form emanated from Pharisee, e.g. circles does not appear to have been proved. It seems more likely that, with the exceptions already referred to, the various component parts of the book were written by Apocalypse, who belonged neither to Pharisee nor yet to Sadgisean circles. Language. The book of Enek exists only in the Ethiopic version. This was translated from the Greek version of which only a few portions are extant. The Latin version, which was also made from the Greek, is not extant, with the exception of 1,9, and 106, 1 through 18. The fragment containing these two passages was discovered by the Reverend Al R. James of King's College, Cambridge, in the British Museum. The book was originally written either in Hebrew or Ermich. Charles thinks that chapters 6 through 36, 58 through 90, were Erimich, the rest Hebrew. It is however very difficult to say for certain which of these two languages was really the original, because as Berkett says, most of the most convincing proofs that the Greek text of Enek is a translation from a semitic language fit equally well with a Hebrew or an erimich original. His opinion is that erimich was the original language, but that a few passages do seem to suggest a Hebrew origin, yet not decisively. General contents. The reader who comes to peruse the book of Enek for the first time will find much that appears to him strange and unattractive. He must not, however, be repelled by this. For in due time he will come to the other arts of the book, which he will soon see to be a real value from many points of view. But even regarding the less attractive parts, he will find that when these are carefully studied, they contain more that is of interest than appears upon the surface. Unfortunately, the opening portion, one through 36, which is naturally read first, contains a good deal of the least important parts of the whole book. Some passages are even repellent. It is well to remember the point already referred to that there are at least four quite independent books included in the book of Enek. Exclusive of certain no-off fragments and other pieces. See below, the student is therefore advised to treat these as separate works and to read them as such. There is no reason to begin with the book which happens to come first, especially as the first 36 chapters do not all belong together. But in any case, it will be found most useful to have some general idea of the contents of each of the different books before beginning to read them, for this purpose of brief resume of each is given here. One, the book of Enek, chapters 12 through 36. The book begins with a dream-vision of Enek. In this dream, Enek is asked to intercede for the watchers of Heaven, i.e. the Angels, who had left their heavenly home to commit iniquity with the daughters of men. He writes out the petition, c.p. the title Enek The Scribe, the fallen Angels make and then retires to await the answer, which comes to him in a series of visions. These visions are not quite easy to follow. They are evidently incomplete and somewhat confused. In all probability, the text has suffered in transmission. At any rate, the petition is refused. Enek declares to the fallen Angels, the doom which, as he has been taught in the visions, is to be there lot. The final words of the message which he has been to give them are, you have no peace. 12 through 16. Their follow then accounts of the different journeys which Enek makes being conducted by Angels of Light through certain parts of the Earth and through Sheel. The account of the first journey, 17 through 19, a short enumeration is made of the Archangels, 7 in number and their functions, 20. In the second journey is described the place of final punishment of the fallen Angels. This place is the prison of the Angels and here they will be imprisoned forever. From thence, Enek is taken to Sheel, then to the west where he sees the luminaries of Heaven. After that, the Angels show him seven magnificent mountains, upon one of which is the throne of God. He sees also the Tree of Life which is to be given to the Holy and righteous after the Great Judgment. From thence, he comes back to the center of the Earth and sees the Blessed Place, Jerusalem and the Accursed Valley, 21 through 27. The book concludes with what appear to be fragments of other journeys to the east, to the north and to the south. Of special interest here is the mention of the Garden of Righteousness and the Tree of Wisdom. Chapter 28 through 36. Much that is written in these chapters may appear pointless and uninspiring, but we must bear in mind the purpose that lies behind it all. The fallen Angels were believed to have brought sin onto the Earth, all the wickedness of the world the Apocalypse traces back to them. This cause of sin must be wholly destroyed before righteousness can come truly to its own. Therefore, the Apocalypse has a practical aim in view when describing in much detail the final place of punishment of the fallen Angels. For here too, are to come all those who by sin are the offspring of this race. No less does he delight in telling of the abode of joy prepared for the righteous. That all these descriptions were constructed out of the imagination of the Apocalypse, based largely no doubt upon popular tradition, did not detract from their practical value for the people of his day. He was a preacher of righteousness who looked forward in absolute conviction to the final overthrow of sin, and all his visions have as their motive power, the yearning for and belief in the triumph of righteousness over sin. One of a like-mind wrote later on in a kind of preface to his book, these significant words, which sum up the essence of the teaching of this book. And destroy all the spirits of the reprobate and the children of the watchers because they have wronged mankind. Destroy all wrong from the face of the Earth and let every evil work come to an end, and let the plan to righteousness and truth appear. And it shall prove a blessing, the works of righteousness and truth shall be planted in truth and joy forevermore. Two, the Parables. Chapters 37-37-71. There are three parables or simulitudes, and they all have as their underlying thought the destruction of evil and the triumph of righteousness, as in the preceding book. But here, some new and important elements are introduced which give special value to this book. The first parable, 38-194, is a prophecy of coming judgment upon the wicked and especially the kings and mighty ones on the earth. On the other hand, the Apocalypse sees in his vision the abode and resting places that the righteous who are continually praising the Lord of spirits. This is the usual title given to God in this book. Here occurs the first mention of the elect one, Luke 23 verse 35. In the presence of the Lord of spirits, there are also the four archangels and a new marble companies of other angels. Here he learns many secrets of the heavens, a fragment on wisdom 42, which recalls some passages in Eccluse 24, comes in the middle of the secrets and is clearly out of place. The second parable, 45-57, continues the same theme and further develops it. A special importance is the sitting of the Electrine on the Throne of Glory, as Judge. Chapter 45 verse 3, and the mention of his title, Son of Man, chapter 46 verse 2, The thought of the vindication of the righteous is marked by their joy at vengeance upon the wicked. A particularly striking passage is chapter 48, one through seven, which speaks of the inexhaustible fountain of righteousness reserved for the Holy and elect in the presence of the Son of Man and of the Lord of spirits. The Apocalypse, prophesized further of the repentance of the Gentiles chapter 1, and universalistic note of significance, and speaks of the resurrection of the dead in an notable passage. And in those days shall the earth also give back that which has been entrusted to it, and she'll also give back that which it has received, and hell shall give back that which it owes. The parable ends with an account of the judgment followed by two short passages on the last struggle of the Heathem powers against Israel, 56, 5-8, and the return from the dispersion, 57, which do not appear to be in their original place. The third parable, 58, through 71, has clearly suffered largely from the intrusion of alien matter and is probably incomplete. Its main theme is the final judgment upon all flesh and especially upon the great ones of the earth. The judges the Son of Man. Some of the passages which speak of the future reward of the righteous are full of beauty, the following is well worth quoting. And the righteous in a lecture have risen from the earth and ceased to be of downcast countenance, and they shall have been clothed with garments of glory, and they shall be garments of life from the Lord of spirits. And your garments shall not grow old, nor your glory pass away before the Lord of spirits. A large Noah fragment comes in the middle of the parable. See page 26 below. The close of this parable is contained in 69, 26 through 29, the account of Enix final translation, 70, and two of Enix visions, 71 are out of place. Three. The book of the courses of the Heavenly Luminaries chapters 72 through 82. In 74, 12 it says, and the Son and the Stars bring in all the years exactly so that they do not advance or delay their position by a single day onto eternity, but complete the years with perfect justice in 364 days. This gives the keynote of this book, vis that time is to be reckoned by the Son, not by the Moon. See further on this section on authorship above. Until we come to chapter 80, this book is uninteresting in the extreme. It purports to tell in detail of the laws by which the Son, Moon, Stars and the Winds are governed. They are described by Eurel, the Holy Angel, to the Apocalypse. The four quarters of the world, the seven mountains and the seven rivers are also dealt with. The author has no other interests, save a scientific one, colored by Jewish conceptions and beliefs. It is however different when we come to chapter 80, verse 2 through 8. The whole tone alters in these verses, in which it is said that owing to the sin of men, the Moon and the Son will mislead them. An ethical thought is thus brought in which is holy lacking in the previous chapters of this book. This is also true of chapter 81. It is probable that neither of these chapters stood here originally. Regarding the points of 364 days to the year which the writer of this book makes, Charles says that he did this only through sheer incapacity for appreciating and thing better. For he must have been acquainted with the solar year of 365 and a fourth days. His acquaintance with the Greek Cycles shows this. The author's reckoning of the year at 364 days may be partly due to his opposition to heathen systems, and partly to the fact that 364 is divisible by seven and amounts to 52 weeks exactly. In any case he is opposed to the lunar year, the pharysiac way of reckoning time, and this is an important point in favor of sadgisi and authorship. It will be noted that this book was written in post-Macabian times. It was after the Macabian struggle that the sadgisi's infaraces appeared as parties definitely opposed to one another. For, the dream slash vision. Chapters 83 through 90. This book consists of two dreams slash visions. The first deals with the judgment brought upon the world by the day-luge on account of sin. The origin of sin is again traced to the angels who fell. It concludes with a him of praise to God in which a prayer is offered that all flesh may not be destroyed. 83 through 84. The second dream slash vision is much longer. It gives in brief outline the history of the world to the founding of the messianic kingdom. First, the patriarchs symbolized by bulls, etc. 85, then the fallen angels also described in symbolic language and their punishment 86 through 88. The history then proceeds to deal more specifically with Israel from the time of Noah to the Macabian revolt 89 through 90. Verse 19. Throughout the dream, dash vision symbolic language is used. The faithful in Israel are spoken of as sheep while the gentiles are symbolized by wild beasts and birds of prey. The dream slash vision concludes with some familiar eschatological notes, the judgment and condemnation of the wicked, the establishment of the new Jerusalem, the conversion of the gentiles who become subject to Israel, the gathering in of the dispersed Israelites, the resurrection of the righteous dead, and the setting up of the messianic kingdom on the appearance of the Messiah. 90, 238. 5. The concluding section of the book. 92 through 105, 91, verses 10, 18 and 19 also belong here. Is a complete, though short work. But there are some obvious interporations and it is quite possible that some parts of the text are dislocated. This makes the understanding of the book difficult, but if we follow Charles's guidance here, the difficulties will disappear. He says that this concluding piece has in some degree suffered at the hands of the final editor of the book. Both in the way of direct interpolation and of severe dislocations of the text. The interpolations are 91, verse 11, 93, verses 11 to 14, 94, 70, 96, verse 2. The dislocations of the text are more important feature of the book. They are confined with the exception of 93, verses 13 to 14 and of 106, verse 17, A, which should be read immediately after 106, verse 14, 2, 91 through 93. All critics are agreed as to the chief of these 91, 12 through 17 should undoubtedly be read directly after 93, take in together 93, verse 11 through 10, 91, 12 through 17, form an independent hole, the apocalypse of weeks which has been incorporated in 91 through 104. The remaining dislocations need only to be pointed out in order to be acknowledged. On other grounds we find that 91 through 104 is a book of different authorship from that of the rest of the sections. Now this being so this section obviously begins with 92 written by Enek the scribe etc. On 92 follows 91, 110, 18 and 19, as a natural sequel where Enek summons his children to receive his parting words, then comes the apocalypse of weeks 93, 110, 91, 12 through 17. The original order of the text, therefore, was 92, 91, 110, 18, 19, 93, 110, 91, 12 through 17, 94. These dislocations were the work of the editor who put the different books of Enek together and added 80 and 81. The book is concerned with the questions of the final reward of the righteous in the final punishment of the wicked, but a new teaching of great importance is put forth here. Hither 2 had been taught that although much in congruity and apparent injustice were to be found on this earth, owing to the suffering of the righteous and the prosperity of the wicked, nevertheless all things would be right in the world to come, where the wicked would receive their desserts and the righteous would come to their own. In this book it is taught that retribution will overtake the wicked and the righteous will have peace and prosperity, even on this earth, with the setting up of the messianic kingdom, and that at least there will come with the final judgment, the destruction of the former heaven and earth, and the creation of a new heaven. Then we'll follow the resurrection of the spirits of the righteous dead who will live forever in peace and joy, while the wicked will perish everlastingly. The important point which is the development is the idea of the punishment of the wicked taking place on this earth, the very scene of their unrighteous triumphs. 6. The Noah fragments 6 through 11 57 through 55 2 9 65 through 69 first 25 166 through 107. These fragments are not of much importance. The main topics touched upon are the fall of the angels and sin among men in consequence. Judgments on mankind, I.e. the Daelooge and the preservation of Noah. The first five chapters are generally felt to be as late as any part of the whole collection. They deal with the punishment hereafter of the wicked and the blessedness of the righteous, chapter 108, which reads like a final word to the whole collection, touches upon the same theme. The importance of the book for the study of Christian origins. This is a subject which cannot be thoroughly appreciated without studying the book in detail, especially from its doctrinal standpoint, and seeing in how many aspects it represents the doctrine and the popular conceptions of the Jews during the two last pre-Christian centuries. To do this here would evolve a far too extended investigation, it must suffice to indicate a few of the many points which should be studied. From these it will be seen how important the book is for study of Christian origins. Charles says that the influence of first enic on the new testament has been greater than that of all the other apocryphal and supographical books put together. And he gives a formidable list of passages in the new testament, which either in phraseology or idea, directly depend on or are illustrative of passages in first enic. Well as a further list showing that various doctrines in first enic had an undoubted share in molding the corresponding new testament doctrines. These passages should be studied and they will be found to be a most interesting study in Charles's work already referred to several times. Pages 95 to 103, and with these should be read the section on the theology of the book of enic, pages 103 to 110. Another book of great value and interest already quoted is Berkett's Jewish and Christian apocrylipses. Reeling with the subject of first enic and the gospels, this writer points out that the former contains a serious attempt to account for the presence of evil in human history and this attempt claims our attention. Because it is in essentials the view presupposed in the gospels, especially in the synaptic gospels. If when you study Matthew Marken Luke against the background of the books of enic that you see them in their true perspective, in saying this I have no intention of detracting from the importance of what the gospels report to us. On the contrary, it puts familiar words into their proper setting. Indeed it seems to me that some of the best known sayings of Jesus only appear in their true light if regarded as midrash upon words and concepts that were familiar to those who heard the prophet of Galilee. Though now they have been forgotten by Jew and Christian alike, page 21. He then gives an illustration of this from Matthew 12, 43 through 45. Luke 11, 24 through 26, of still greater interest are his remarks upon the relationship between first enic 62 and Matthew 25, verse 31 through 46. He believes that the similitudes of enic are pre-supposed in the scene from Matthew, the whole of the discussion which follows should be read. The special points of interest that should be studied in seeking to realize the importance of these books of enic for the study of Christian origins are the problems of evil, including, of course, the subjects of demonology and future judgment. The Messiah and the Messianic Kingdom, the title Son of Man, is of special importance and the resurrection. There are of course other subjects which will suggest themselves in studying the book.

The Meditations of the Emperor, Marcus or Relious and Toneenus by Marcus or Relious, translated by George Crystal, 1888 through 1944, Book 1. I learned from my grandfather, Virus, to use good manners and to put restraint on anger. In the famous memory of my father, I had a pattern of modesty and manliness. As my mother, I learned to be pious and generous, to keep myself not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts, and to live with a simplicity which is far from customary among the rich. I owe it to my great grandfather that I did not attend public lectures and discussions, but had good and able teachers at home. And I owe him also the knowledge that for things of this nature, a man should count no expense to great. My tutor taught me not to favor either green or blue at the cherry at races, nor in the contests of gladiators to be a supporter either of light or heavy armed. He taught me also to endure labor, not to need many things, to serve myself without troubling others, not to enter metal in the affairs of others, and not easily to listen to slanders against them. Of Diagnitas, I had the lesson, not to busy myself about vain things, not to credit the great professions of such as pretend to work wonders, or of sorcerers about their charms, and their expeling of demons and the like. Not to keep quails for fighting or divination, no to run after such things, to suffer freedom of speech and others, and to apply myself hardly to philosophy. Him also, I must thank, for my hearing first back use, then tendasis, and martianos, that I wrote dialogues in my youth and took a liking to the philosophers' paladin skins, and to the other things which by the Greece discipline belonged to that profession. To Worsticus, I owe my first apprehensions that my nature needed reform and cure, and that I did not fall into the ambition of the common sofists, either by composing speculative writings or by declaiming her ranks of exhortation in public. Further, that I never strove to be admired by ostentation of great patience in an aesthetic life, or by display of activity and application, that I gave over the study of rhetoric, poetry, and the graces of language, and that I did not pace my house in the sanitorial robes, or practice any similar affectation. I observed also the simplicity of style in his letters, particularly in that which he wrote to my mother from C. USa. I learned from him to be easily appeased, and to be readily reconciled with those who had displeased me, or given cause of offense, so soon as they inclined to make their peace, to read with care. Not to rest satisfied with a slight and superficial knowledge, nor quickly to ascend to great Prokers. I have him to thank that I met with the discourses of Epictetus, which he furnished me from his own library. From Epilonia's silent true liberty and tenacity of purpose, to regard nothing else even in the smallest degree, but reason always, and always to remain unaltered in the agonies of pain, in the losses of children, or in long diseases. He afforded me a living example of how the same man can upon occasion be most yielding and most inflexible. He was patient in exposition, and, as might well be seen, esteemed his fine skill and ability in teaching others the principles of philosophy as the least of his endowments. It was from him that I learned how to receive from friends what are thought favors, without seeming humbled by the giver, or insensible to the gift. Sexless was my pattern of a benign temper, and his family, the model of a household governed by true paternal affection, and a steadfast purpose of living according to nature. Here I could learn to be grave without effectation, to observe sigaselessly several dispositions and inclinations of my friends, to tolerate the ignorant, and those who follow current opinions without examination. His conversation showed how a man may accommodate himself to all men and to all companies. For the companionship with him was sweeter and more pleasing than any sort of flattery, yet he was at the same time highly respected and reverenced. No man was ever more happy than he, in comprehending, finding out, and arranging in exact order the great maxims necessary for the conduct of life. His example taught me to suppress even the least appearance of anger or any other passion, but still with all this perfect tranquility to possess the tenderist and most affectionate heart. To be apt to approve others yet without noise, to have much learning and little ostentation. I learned from Alexander the Gremarian to avoid censoring others, to refrain from flouting them for a barbarism, solosism, or any false pronunciation. Rather was I dexterously to pronounce the words rightly in my answer, confining approval or objection to the matter itself and avoiding discussion of the expression, where to use some other form of courteous suggestion. Fronto made me sensible how much of envy, deceit and hypocrisy surrounds princes, and that generally those whom we account no believer have somehow less natural affection. I learned from Alexander the Platonist, not often nor without great necessity, to say or write to any man in a letter that I am not at leisure. More thus under pretext of urgent affairs to make the practice of excusing myself from the duties which according to our various ties we owe to those with whom we live. Of coutulous I learned not to condemn any friends' expostulation, even though it were unjust, but to try to recall him to his former disposition, to stint no praise and speaking of my masters, as is recounted of the meteous and athonotorous, and to love my children with true affection. Of severus my brother, I learned to love my kidsmen, to love truth, to love justice. Through him I came to know Thracia, how videos, kato, Dion and Brutus. He gave me my first conception of a commonwealth, founded upon equitable laws and administered with equality of right, and of a monarchy whose chief concern is the freedom of its subjects. Of him I learned likewise a constant and harmonious devotion to philosophy, to be ready to do good, to be generous with all my heart. He taught me to be of good hope, and to trustful of the affection of my friends. I observed in him, tender, and declaring what he condemned in the conduct of others, and so frank and open was his behavior that his friends might easily see without the trouble of conjecture, what he liked or disliked. The councils of Maxim was taught me to command myself, to judge clearly, to be of good courage in sickness and other misfortunes, to be moderate, gentle, yet serious in disposition, and to accomplish my appointed task without repining. All men believed that he spoke as he thought, and whatever he did, they knew it was done with good intent. I never found him surprised or astonished at anything. He was never in a hurry, never shank from his purpose, was never at a loss or dejected. He was no fassile, smileer, but neither was he passionate or suspicious. He was ready to do good, to forgive and to speak the truth, and gave the impression of unproverted rectitude, rather than of a reformed character. No man could ever think himself despised by Maximus, and no one ever ventured to think himself his superior. He had also a good gift of humor. I learned from my father, gentleness, and undivvading constancy in judgments, formed after due reflection, not to be puffed up with glory as men understand it, to be laborious and assiduous. He taught me to give ready hearing to any man who offered anything tending to the common good, to meet out impartial justice to everyone. To apprehend rightly, when severity and when clemency should be used, to abstain from all impure lusts, and to use humanity towards all men. Thus he left his friends at liberty to sub with him or not, to go abroad with him or not, exactly as they inclined. And they found him still the same if some urgent business had prevented them from obeying his commands. I learned of him accuracy and patience in counsel, for he never quitted an inquiry satisfied with first impressions. I observed his zeal to retain his friends without being fickle or overfond. His contentment in every condition, his cheerfulness, his forethought about very distant events, his unostentation's attention to the smallest details, his restraint of all popular applause and flattery. Ever watchful of the needs of the empire, a careful steward of the public revenue, he was tolerant of the center of others in affairs of that kind. He was neither a superstitious worshipper of the gods nor an ambitious pleaser of men, nor studious of popularity, but in all things sober and steadfast, well skilled in what was honorable, never affecting novelties. As to the things which make the ease of life and which fortune can supply in such abundance, he used them without pride, and yet with all freedom, enjoyed them without affectation when they were present, and when absent, he found no one of them. No man could call him sofast, perfun, or pidened. He was a man of ripe experience, a full man, one who could not be flattered and one who could govern himself, as well as others. I further observed that he honored all who were truthful asifers without upgrading the rest, and without being lit astray by any. His manners were easy, his conversation delightful, but not clawing. He took regular but moderate care of his body, neither as one over-fund of life or the adormate of his person, nor as one who despised these things. Thus through his own care he seldom needed any medicines, whether saves or potions. It was his special merit to yield without envy, to any who acquired any special faculty, as either eloquence or learning in the law in ancient customs or the like, and he hated such men strenuously so that every one of them might be regarded and distained for his special excellence. He observed carefully the ancient customs of his forefathers, and preserved without appearance of affectation the ways of his native land. He was not fickle and capricious and loved not change of place or employment. After his violent fits of headache he would return fresh and vigorous to his wanted affairs. Of secrets he had few, and these seldom, and such only as concerned public matters. He displayed discretion and moderation, and exhibiting shows for the entertainment of the people in his public works in his large jesses and a like. And in all those things he acted like one who regarded only what was right and becoming in the things themselves, and not the reputation that might follow after. He never bathed that unsusorable hours had no vanity in building, was never solicitous either about his food or about the make or color of his clothes, or about the beauty of his servants. His dress came from warium, his villa on the coast, and was of linovie and wool for the most part. It is remembered how he used the tax collector Tuskeulum, who asked his pardon, and all his behavior was of a peace with that. He was far from being inhuman or impackable or violent, never doing anything with such keenness that wouldn't say he was sweating about it. In all things he reasoned distinctly, as one at leisure calmly, regularly, resolutely and consistently. A man might fairly apply to him, which is recorded of Socrates, that he could both abstain from and enjoy these things, in want where of many show themselves weak and in the possession, in temperate. To be strong in abstinence and temperate in enjoyment, to be sober in both, these are qualities of a man of perfect and invincible soul, as was shown in the sickness of maximus. To the gods, I owe it, that I had good grandfather's and parents, a good sister, good teachers, good servants, good kidsmen and friends, good almost all of them. I have to thank them that I never through haste and ratcheness offended any of them, though my temper was such as might have led me to it, had occasion offered. But by their goodness, no such concurrence of circumstances happened as could discover my weakness. I am further thankful that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine, that I retained my modesty and refrain even longer than need have been from the pleasures of love. To the gods, it is due that I lived under the government of such a prince and father as could take from me all vain glory, and convince me that it was not impossible for a prince to live in a court without guards, gorgeous robes, torches, statues, or such pieces of state and magnificence. But that he may reduce himself almost to the state of a private man and yet not become more mean or remiss in those public affairs, where in power and authority are requisite. I thank the gods that I have had such a brother as by his disposition might stir me to take care of myself, while at the same time he delighted me by his respect and love. I thank them that my children either wanted good, natural dispositions, nor were deformed in body. I owe it to their good guidance that I made no greater progress in rhetoric and poetry and in other studies, which might have engrossed my mind, had I found myself successful in them. By the gods grace, I forestalled the wishes of those by whom I was brought up, in promoting them to the dignities they seemed most to desire. I did not put them off with the hope that since they were but young I would do it here after. I owe to the gods that I never knew Apolognius, Usticus, and de Maximus, and that I have had occasion often and effectively to meditate with myself and inquire what is truly the life according to nature. And as far as lies within the dispensation of the gods to give suggestion, help or inspiration, there is nothing to prevent my having already realized that life. I have fallen short of it by my own fault, and because I give no heed to the in-good omissions and almost direct instructions of the gods to whom the thanks that my body have so long endured the stress of such a life as I have led. By their goodness I never had to do with either Benedicta or Fiodotus and afterwards when I fell into some foolish passions I was soon cured. I give thanks that having often been displeased with Usticus, I never did anything to him which afterwards I might have had occasion to repent. That though my mother was destined to die young, she lived with me all her latter years. That is often as I inclined to sucker any who or either poor who had fallen into some distress, I was never answered that there was not ready money enough to do it that I myself never had need of the like sucker from another. I must be grateful to that I have such a wife, so obedient, so loving, so ingenuous that I had choice of fit and evil men to whom I might commit the education of my children. I have received divine aids in dreams, in particular how I might stay my spitting of blood and cure my vertigo, which for good fortune happily fell to me a caita. The gods watched over me, also when I first applied myself to philosophy, for I fell not into the hands of any so-fist, nor sat pouring over many volumes, nor devoted myself to solving syllogisms or stargazing. That all these things should so happily fall out. There was great need both for the help of fortune and for the aid of the gods, in the country of the Quady by the Grand Waw.

Reporting by Melanie Schleeder, McCallmont, Madison Wisconsin, on the web at melany.mecallmont.org. Biographical Memoir of John Wesley Powell, 1834 to 1902 by William Morris Davis, Section 1, John Wesley Powell. John Wesley Powell was in more senses than one, a scientific friend tearsman. His life reveals the energetic working of a vigorous and independent personality, not trampled by traditional methods and not so deeply versed in the history, the content, and the technique of the sciences, has to be guided by them, but impelled to the rapid discovery of new principles by the inspiration of previously and explored surroundings. His life shows us further how a man of exceptional power rises suddenly in another wise undistinguished lineage, and how he surmounts the limiting associations of early years, less through the opportunity provided by others, then through opportunities opened by his own individual enterprise for the satisfaction of inborn interests. Early life Powell, the fourth of nine children, was born of English parents at Mount Morris in the Genesee Valley of Western New York on March 24, 1834. His father, Joseph Powell, a Methodist preacher, and his mother, Mary Dean Powell, had come to the United States a short time before. The family moved from New York to Jackson, Ohio in 1838, 39 to South Grove, Wisconsin, in 1846, and eventually to Illinois, settling first at bonus prairie in 1851, and later at Wheaton in 1854. Thus in Illinois, Powell lived from his 17th to his 27th year. While he was still a boy in Ohio, he had experience of anti-slavery agitation. His father was a staunch abolitionist who did not conceal his opinions, and as a result the sun was so unfairly treated by his mates in the village school that he was removed from it, and for a time put under the care of a well to do elderly neighbor named Crickham. Who taught gratuitously, and irregularly, in a log-house school and laboratory, as well as in the field. It was thus that young Powell made a beginning in scientific study in observation. When the move was made from Ohio, all the household goods were transported in a wagon and two carriages, one of the latter being driven by young John to Wisconsin. Here the boy, when his father was away from home preaching, had the duty of conducting the farm, for which the family derived its principal support, and of hauling farm produce to markets, five or six days to a trip, and twelve or more trips in a year. But his heart was in his studies. And in the winter of 1850, he went to Jane'sville, 20 miles from home to attend school, and he was in the morning for his keep on a nearby farm. In 1852, he began school teaching, with half his pupils older than himself. And for the following nine years, he alternately taught, studied and traveled. He had the good fortune at the outset of this laborious period to fall in with intelligent school officials, but much of his teaching was done under narrowing conditions of isolation and privation. His college studies were varied. They were pursued at Illinois College, Jacksonville, 1855 to 1856, at Oberlin College, Ohio, 1858, where he studied chiefly botany, Latin, and Greek, and at Wheaton College in 1858. Powell was a naturalist at that time, fond of roaming, observing, and collecting. He had joined the state society of natural history in 1854, and in making an extensive collection of Malaska, he crossed most of the Prairie states. In 1856, he traveled, a young fellow of 22, alone in his boat on the Mississippi. The next year he descended the Ohio, and the year after he followed the Illinois and Des Moines rivers. His collections brought him into relation with various colleges. He became secretary of the Illinois Society of Natural History, and his friends of that time found him an entertaining narrator, full of enthusiasm, humor, and philosophy.

True Stories of Crime From The District Attorney's Office. By Arthur Cheney Train. Preface. The narratives composing this book are literally true stories of crime. In a majority of the cases, the author conducted the prosecution himself, and therefore may claim to have a personal knowledge of that whereof he speaks. While no confidence has been abused, no essential facts have been omitted, distorted, or colored, and the accounts themselves being all matters of public record may be easily verified. The scenes recorded here are not literature but history. And the characters who figure in them are not puppets of the imagination, but men and women who lived and schemeed, laughed, sinned, and suffered. And paid the price when the time came, most of them, without flinching. A few of those who read these pages may profit perhaps by their example. Others may gain somewhat in their knowledge of life and human nature. But I will agree that there are books in the running books, even if the streams be turbid, and sermons and stones, though these be the hearts of men. If in some instances the narratives, savor, and treatment more affection than a fact, the writer must plead guilty to having fallen under the spell of the romance of his subject. Any prophecy excuse that whereas such tales have lost nothing in accuracy, they may have gained in the truth of their final impression. Arthur Train Criminal Court's Building, New York City, April 20, 1908. Chapter 1. The Woman in the Case. On a sultry August afternoon in 1903, a dapper, if somewhat anemic young man, entered the Broadway store of Rogers, Pete, and Company, in New York City, an ask to be allowed to look at a suit of clothes. Having selected one to his fancy and arranged for some alterations, he produced from his wallet a check for $280. Draw into the order of George B. Lang, and signed E. Beer Stop, and remarked to the Attent of Salesman. I haven't got quite enough cash with me to pay for these, but I have been intending to cash this check all the afternoon. Of course, you don't know me, or even that my name is Lang, but if you will forward the check to the bank, they will certify it, and tomorrow I will send for the suit and the balance of the money. Certainly Mr. Lang replied this salesman, I will hold the suit and the money to await your orders. The customer thanked him and took his departure. The check was sent to the bank, the bank certified it, then canceled its certification, and returned to the check to Rogers Pete and Company. In the store detectives having communicated with police headquarters, anxiously awaited the arrival of Mr. Lang's messenger. Their efforts were rewarded a couple of days later by the appearance at the store of a lad who presented a written order, inscribed upon the back of an envelope, bearing a canceled stamp, and addressed to George B. Lang, number 13 West 26th Street, New York City, which read as follows. Rogers Pete and Company. Please give to Barrett the clothes I purchased on Tuesday, suit, pants, escode, and also kindly put change in envelope in inside coat pocket. Trusting the alterations are satisfactory, and thanking you on advance for the favor and for past curdices, I am respectfully yours, George B. Lang. The boy was immediately placed under arrest, and after proclaiming his own innocence, and both separating that he was only doing an errand for a gent who was waiting close by, was directed to return with his bundle as if nothing had occurred. This he did, and Mr. George B. Lang was soon in the clutches of the law. Intangated by his captors, the supposed Lang admitted that his real name was James Parker, that he lived at 110 West 38th Street, and only requested that his wife be immediately notified of what had happened. At headquarters, the prisoner was identified as a gentleman who had been very actively engaged during the preceding months, impassing bad checks throughout the city. His more recent operations have been consisted in caching a check on the Lincoln National Bank for $160 on July 20th, $1 for $290 on the same bank on July 30th, still another for 51050 on August 4th, and 1 for 44050 on the National shoe and leather bank to Barrett on August 8th. This last, in some inexplicable way, had been cached at the very bank itself. Believing that the forger had it less than caught, the precinct detectives later on, during the evening of Parker's arrest, visited West 38th Street and on inquiring for Mrs. Parker, were introduced to a young girl of attractive appearance to whom they delivered their unwelcome message. Mrs. Parker seemed overwhelmed at the news and strongly asserted her confidence and her husband's innocence of any wrongdoing. Having performed the errand the officers departed. A certain inerraticable jealousy has always existed between the plain close men of the various precincts and the sleuths attached to the central office, and in this instance the precinct men having gained the credit for the arrest, it did not occur to them as necessary to communicate the knowledge of their acquaintance with Mrs. Parker to detective sergeant P. Body and Clark, originally assigned at headquarters to investigate the case. It seemed, however, to P. Body, very unlikely that Parker had conducted his operations alone, and he therefore, once inquired at the tombs, what character visitors came to see the prisoner. The gateman replied that as yet none had arrived, at that very instant, a young girl stepped to the wicked, and asked if she could be allowed to see Mr. James Parker. It took the detective but a moment to run across to the criminal court's building, and to telephone the warden to detain her temporarily, and then to refuse her request. Five minutes later the girl emerged, disconsolately, from the tombs, and boarded a car going up town. P. Body followed her to 110 West 38th Street, not for an instance opposing that the girl herself could be the forger, but believing that possibly through her, he might learn of other members of the gang, and secure additional evidence against Parker himself. Of course, no intelligent person today, supposes that, outside of Sir Conan Doyle's interesting novels, detectives seek the baffling criminal by means of analyzing cigar butts, magnifying thumb marks, or specializing in the various perfumes in favor among the fair sex. Or by any of those complicated, brain fatiguing processes of ratio, soination, indulged in by our old friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. There are still, however, genuine detectives, and some of them are to be found upon the New York police force. The magnifying glass is not one of the ordinary tools of the professional sleuth, and if he carries a pistol at all, it is because the police rules require it. While those cases may be numbered upon the fingers of two hands, where his own hair and whiskers were not entirely sufficient for his purposes in the course of his professional career. The next morning, P. Body dunged the most disreputable suit in his wardrobe, neglected his ordinary visit to the barber, and called at 110 West 38th Street, being of course, at this time entirely unaware of the fact that the girl was Parker's wife. He found her sitting in a rocking chair and a comfortable well-furnished room and reading a magazine. Assuming an expression of sheepish in anity, he informed her that he was an old pal of gems, who had been so unfortunate as to be locked up in the same cell with him at headquarters, and that the latter was in desperate need of morphine. But Parker was a habitual user of the drug could be easily seen from the most casual inspection, but that it would prove an open sesame to the girl's confidence was as the detective F.G. were testified, 100-1 shot. Poor Jim exclaimed the girl. Couldn't she smuggle some into the tombs for him? P. Body took the hint. Of course he could. It would be a hard job, those turnkeys were so suspicious. But he could do it for her if anybody could. He rambled on, telling his experiences with Parker in the past, how he had been in a myro reformatory and elsewhere with him, and gaining each moment valuable information from the girl's exclamations, questions, and expression. He soon learned that she was Parker's wife, that they were living in comparative comfort, and that she was an exceedingly clever and well-educated woman. But she said nothing during the conversation which would indicate that she knew anything of her husband's offenses, or any persons connected with them. After a few moments, the girl slipped on her coat and hat, and the two started down to the tombs, where, by pre-arrangement with the officials, the detective succeeded in convincing her that he had been able to send into her husband a small hypothermic strange, commonly called the needles, which she had purchased at a neighboring drugstore. The apparent success of this undertaking put Mrs. Parker in excellent humor, and she invited the supposed crook to breakfast with her at the Broadway Central Hotel. So far it will be observed Peabody had accomplished practically nothing. At breakfast, the girl inquired of her companion what his particular graft was, to which he replied that he was an expert second story man, and then proceeded to indulge his imagination in accounts of bold robberies in the Brownstone districts, and clever tricks in other cities, which left Mrs. Parker in no doubt that her companion was an expert gun of long experience. Then he took as he expressed it another chance. Jim wanted me to tell you to put the gang wise, said he. The girl looked at him sharply and contracted her brows. Gang, she exclaimed what gang? Oh, perhaps he met Dutch and Sweeney. Peabody bit his lip. He had had a close call. Don't know he replied he didn't say who they were, just to put them wise. A second time the detective had made a lucky hit, for Mrs. Parker suddenly laid aside all pretense and asked, do you want to make a lot of money? Peabody allowed that he did. Do you know what they have got Jim for? Asked the girl. Fony paper wasn't it? Yes, said Mrs. Parker, but Jim didn't write those checks. I wrote them myself. If you want to go in with me, we can earn enough money to get Jim out and you can do a good turn for yourself besides. The detective's blood leapt in his veins, but he held himself under control as well as he could and answered indifferently. I guess not, an ever-metal woman that was very good at that sort of game. Oh, you don't know me, she persisted, why I can copy anything in a few moments really I can. Two dangerous remarked Peabody, I might get settled for ten years. No, you wouldn't, she continued. It's the easiest thing in the world. All you have to do is pick the mail out of some box on a corner. I can show you how with the copper wire and a little piece of wax and you are sure to find among the letters somebody's check in payment of a bill. There at once you have the bank in the signature. Then all you have to do is to write a letter to the bank asking for a new checkbook, saying yours is used up, and sign the name that appears on the check. If you can fool the cashier and to give your messenger a checkbook, you can gamble pretty safely on his paying a check signed with the same name. In that way, you see, you can get all the blank checks you need and test the cashier's washfulness at the same time. It's too easy. The only thing you have to look out for is not to over draw the account. Still, you find so many checks in the mail that you can usually choose somebody's account that will stand the strain. Do you know? I have made hundreds of checks and the banks have certified every single one. Peabody left good naturely. Things were looking up a bit. What do you think I am anyhow? He asked, I must look like a come-on. I'm given it to you straight, she said simply. After you've made out a good fat check, then you go to a store by something. Tell them to forward the check to the bank for certification and that you'll send for the goods in the change the next day. The bank always certifies the check and you get the money. Not always said Peabody with a grin. Now not always acquiesced Mrs. Parker, but Jim and I have been averaging over a hundred dollars a day for months. Good graphed alright, ascended the detective. But how does the one who lays down the check identify himself? For instance, suppose I go into Tiffany's and pick out a diamond and say I'm Mr. John Smith of 100 West 100 Street and the floorwalker says, sorry Mr. Smith, but we don't know you. What then? Just flash a few letters on him, said the girl letters and envelopes. Where do you get them? Ask Peabody. Just write them silly and send them to yourself through the mail. That's alright, retorted the second story man. And how can I mail myself a letter to 100 West 100 Street when I don't live there? Mrs. Parker smiled in a superior manner. I'm glad I can put you wise to a new game. I invented it myself. You want letters of identification in different names and addresses on different days? Very good. Buy a bundle of stamped envelopes and write your own name and address on them in pencil. When they arrive, rub off the pencil address. And if you want to be John Smith of 100 West 100 Street or anybody else, just address the cancelled envelope and ink. Mabel said Peabody with admiration, you've got the gray matter alright. You can have me if you can deliver the rest of the goods. There's still another little frill she continued, please do this compliment. If you want to do the thing in style. Maybe he will find a letter or billhead in the mail at the same time that you get your sample check. You can do, you can have it copied and write your request for the checkbook and your order for the goods on paper printed exactly like it. That gives a sort of final touch you know. I remember we did that with a dentist named Bud at 137 West 22nd Street. You've got all the rest whipped to a standstill, cried Peabody. Well, just come over to the room and I'll show you something worthwhile. Explain the girl, getting up and paying their bill. Now said she, when they were safely at West 38th Street and she closed the door of the room and drawn Peabody to a desk in the Bay window. Here's my regular handwriting. She pulled towards her a pad which lay open upon the desk and wrote in a fair round hand. Mrs. James D. Singley. This, she continued changing her slant and dashing off a queer feminine scroll. Is the signature we fooled the Lincoln National Bank with? Miss Calzers, you know. In this, she added a moment later, adopting a stiff, shaky humpbacked orthography is the signature that got poor Jim into all this trouble and she inscribed twice upon the paper the name E. Beerstadt. Poor Jim, she added to herself. By George Mabel, remarked to the detective, you're a wonder. See if you didn't copy my name. And Peabody wrote the assumed name of William Hickey, first with a stub and then with a fine point, both of which signatures she copied like a flash. In each case, however, being guilty of the lapse of spelling the word William, William. The pad now contained more than enough evidence to convict 20 women. And Peabody, with the remark, you don't want to leave this kind of thing lying around Mabel, retended to tear the page up, but substituted a blank sheet in its place and smuggled the precious bit of paper into his pocket. Yes, I'll go into business with you, sure I will, said Peabody. We'll get enough money to set Jim free, exclaimed to the girl. They were now fast friends, and it was agreed that Hickey should go and make himself presentable. After which they would die in its own restaurant and then sample convenient mailbox. Meantime Peabody telephone to headquarters, and when the two set out for dinner at 6 o'clock, the supposed Hickey was stopped on Broadway by Detective Sergeant Clark. What are you doing here in New York, demanding Clark? Did I give you six hours to fly the coop? And who's this woman? I was going Clark on a steward was wine-hickey, and this lady's alright, she hasn't done a thing. Well, I guess I got to lock you up ahead quarters for the night, said Clark roughly. The girl can go. Oh, Mr. Clark, do come and have dinner with us first, exclaimed to Mrs. Parker. Mr. Hickey's been so very good to me, and he hasn't had anything to eat forever, so long. Don't care if I do, said Clark. I guess I can put up with the company if the board is good. The three entered the Raleigh Hotel in order to substantial meal. With the arrival of dessert, however, the girl became uneasy, and apparently fearing a rest herself slipped a roll of bills under the table to Hickey, and whispered to him to keep it for her. The detective, thinking that the farce had gone far enough through the money on the table and asked Clark to count it. At the same tune, telling Mrs. Parker that she was in custody. The girl turned white, uttered a little scream, and then regaining herself possession, and remarked as nonchalantly as she pleased. Well, clever as she think you are, you've destroyed the only evidence against me, my handwriting. Not much, remarked Peabody, producing the sheet of paper. The girl saw that the game was up and made a mock bow to the two detectives. I take my hat off to the New York police, said she. At this time, apparently, no thought of denying her guilt had entered her mind, and at the station house she's talked freely to the sergeant, the matron and the various newspaper men who were present. Even drawing pictures of herself upon loose sheets of paper and signing her name, apparently rather enjoying the notoriety which her arrest had occasioned. A thorough search of her apartment was now made with the result that several sheets of paper were found there, bearing what were evidently practiced signatures of the name Alice Couser. Evidence was also obtained showing that on the day following her husband's arrest, she had destroyed large quantities of blank checkbooks and blank checks. Upon the trial of Mrs. Parker, the handwriting experts testified that the beer-statt and Couser signatures were so perfect that it would be difficult to state that they were not originals. The Parker woman was what is sometimes known as a free-hand forger. She never traced anything, and as her forgeries were written by a muscular imitation of the pen movement of the writer of the genuine signature, they were almost impossible of detection. When Albert T. Patrick forged the signature of Old Mr. Rice to the spurious will of 1900 and to the checks for $25,000, $65,000 and $135,000 upon Swenson's bank and the Fifth Avenue Trust Company, the four juries were easily detected from the fact that as Patrick had traced to them, they were almost exactly alike and practically could be superimposed one upon another, line for line.for. Mabel Parker's early history is shrouded in a certain amount of obscurity, but there's reason to believe that she was the offspring of respectable laboring people, who turned her over while she was still an infant to a Mr. Mrs. Prentice, instructors in physical culture in the public schools, first of St. Louis and later of St. Paul, Minnesota. As a child and afterwards as a young girl, she exhibited great precocity and a considerable amount of real ability in drawing and in English composition, but her very cleverness and versatility were the means of her becoming much more sophisticated than most young women of her age. With the result that while still in her teens, she gave her adopted parents ground for considerable on easiness. Accordingly, they decided to place her for the next few years in a convent near New York. By this time, she had attained a high degree of proficiency in writing short stories and miscellaneous articles which she illustrated herself for the papers and inferior magazines. Convent life proved very dull for this young lady, and accordingly one dark evening, she made her exit from the cloister by means of a conveniently located window. Waiting for her in the grounds below was James Parker, 27 years old, already of a large criminal experience, although never yet convicted of crime. The two made their way to New York, were married and the girl entered upon her career. Her husband, whose real name was James D. Singley, was a professional tenderloin crook, ready to turn his hand to any sort of cheap crime to satisfy his appetite and support life. The money easily secured was easily spent, and singley at the time of his marriage was addicted to most of the vices common to the habitual ways of the underworld. His worst enemy was the morphine habit, and from her husband Mrs. Singley speedily learned the use of the drug. At this time, Mabel Prentice Parker Singley was about five feet two inches in height, weighing not more than a hundred and five or a hundred and ten pounds, slender to girlishness and showing no maturity save in her face, which, with a tie color, brilliant blue eyes and her yellow hair, often led those who glanced at her casually to think her good looking. Another inspection, however, revealed a fox-like expression, an irregularity in the position of the eyes, a hardness in the lines of the mouth and a flatness of the nose, which belied the first impression. This was particularly true when, after being deprived of morphine in the tombs, her ordinary high color gave way at her second child to a waxy paleness of complexion. But the story of her career in the tenderloin would prove neither profitable nor attractive. The subsequent history of the Parker case is a startling example of the credulity of the ordinary jury. The evidence secured was absolutely conclusive, but unfortunately, juries are generally unwilling to take the uncorroborated word of a policeman against that of a defendant, particularly if the defendant be a young and pretty woman. Here, at the very outset, was a complete confession on the part of Mrs. Parker, supplemented by illustrations from her own pen of what she could do. Harrison showed that the signature she had written without a model upon the P. Body Sheet, where identical with those upon the forged checks, and with Mr. Beer Stats and Ms. Calzers handwriting. When Mrs. Parker's case, therefore, came on for pleading, her counsel, probably because they could think of nothing else to do, entered a plea of insanity. It was also intimated that the young woman would probably plead guilty, and the case was therefore placed upon the calendar and moved for trial, without much preparation on the part of the prosecution. Instead of this young person confessing her guilt, however, she amused herself by owing the jury, and drawing pictures of the court, the district attorney, and the various witnesses. Probably no more extraordinary scene was ever beheld in a court of law, than that exhibited by part two of the general sessions upon Mabel Parker's first trial for forgery. Attired in a sky blue dress and picture hat, with new white gloves, she sat jantily by the side of her counsel throughout the proceedings, toying with her pen and pencil, and in the very presence of the jury copying handwriting which was given her for that purpose, by various members of the yellow press who crowded close behind the rail. From time to time, she would dash off an aphorism or a paragraph and regard to the trial, which she handed to a reporter. If satisfactory, this was elaborated and sometimes even illustrated by her for the evening edition of his paper. The assistant district attorney complained that this was clearly a contempt of court, particularly as the defendant had drawn a picture not only of himself, but of the presiding justice and a witness, which had appeared in one of the evening papers. The court, however, did not see that anything could be done about it, and the girl openly continued her literary and artistic recreation. The court itself was not a little amused at the actions of the defendant, and when detective Peabody was called to the stand, the general hilarity had reached such a pitch that he was unable to give his testimony without smiling. The natural result, therefore, at the first trial, was that the detective succeeded in giving the unqualified impression that he was drawing the long bow in a most preposterous fashion. At the conclusion of the people's case, the evidence that Mrs. Parker had forged the checks amounted simply to this. That an officer who was greatly interested in her conviction had sworn to a most astonishing series of facts from which the jury must infer that this exceedingly a suit young person had not only been entirely and completely deceived by a detective, but also that at almost their first meeting she confessed to him in detail the history of her crimes. Practically the only other evidence tending to corroborate his story were a few admissions of a similar character made by her to newspaper men, matrons and officers at the police station. Unless the jury were to believe that Mrs. Parker had actually written the signatures on the Peabody sheet, there was no evidence that she was the actual forger. Hence upon Peabody's word alone depended the verdict of the jury. The trouble with the case was that it was too strong, too good, to be entirely credible. And had there been no defense, it is exceedingly probable that the trial would have resulted in an acquittal, since the prosecution had elected to go to the jury upon the question of whether or not the defendant had actually signed the checks herself. Mrs. Parker, however, had withdrawn her plea of insanity and determined to put on a defense, which proved in its turn to be even more extraordinary than the case against her. This in brief was to the effect that she had known Peabody to be a police officer all along, but that it had occurred to her that if she could deceive him into believing that it was she herself who had committed the forgeries, her husband might get off, and that later she might intern establish her own innocence. She had therefore hastily scratched her name at the top of a sheet already containing her husband's handwriting, and it told Peabody that the signatures had been written by herself. That the sheet had been written in the officer's presence, she declared to be a pure invention on his part to secure her conviction. She told her extremely illogical story, with a certain when some naive attack which carried an air of semi-probability with it. From her department on the stand, one would have taken her for a boarding school mess, who, in some inconsequent fashion, had gotten mixed up in a frolic for which no really logical explanation could be given. Then the door in the back of the courtroom opened, and James Parker was led to the bar, where in the presence of the jury he plead guilty to the forgery of the very signature for which his wife was standing trial. She was then sworn as a witness, took the stand and testified that he had written all the forged signatures to the checks, including the signatures upon the Peabody sheet. The district attorney found himself in an embarrassing position. If Parker was the forger, why not challenge him to write the forged signatures upon the witness stand and thus to prove his alleged capacity for so doing? The obvious objection to this was that Parker, an anticipation of this test, had probably been practicing the signature in the tombs for months. On the other hand, if the district attorney did not challenge him to write the signatures, the defense would argue that he was afraid to do so, and that his Parker had sworn himself to be the forger, it was not incumbent upon the defense to prove it further, that it was a matter for cross-examination. With considerable hesitation, the prosecuting attorney asked Parker to write the couser signature, which was the one set forth in the indictment charging the forgeri, and after much backing and filling on the part of the witness, who ingeniously complained that he was in a bad nervous condition, owing to the lack of morphine, in consequence of which his hand trembled, and he was in no condition to write forgeri's. The latter took his pen and managed to make a very fair copy of the couser signature for memory. Good enough, in fact, to warrant a jury informing the conclusion that he was in fact the forger. This closed to the case. The defense claimed that it was clear that James Parker was the forger, since he had admitted it in open court, pleaded guilty to the indictment, and proved that he had the capacity. The prosecution, upon the other hand, argued that the evidence was conclusive, that the defendant herself was the writer of the check. The whole thing boiled down to whether or not the jury was going to believe that Mrs. Parker had written the Peabody sheet in the presence of the detective. When her husband claimed that, with the exception of Mabel's signature, he had done it himself and carelessly left the paper in his desk in the room. The prosecuting attorney was at his wits end for an argument to meet the fact that Parker had written the sample forgeri of the couser signature before the very eyes of the jury. He found it at last, in an offer on his own part in open court, daring his summing up, to write for the jury from memory, a better forgeri of the couser signature than that written by Parker himself, and thus to show how simple a matter it was to learn to do so. He had taken up his pen and was about to give a sample of his handy work in this respect, when the defendant grasped her counsel's arm and whispered, for God's sake, don't let him do it. Whereupon the lawyer arose and objected, saying that such evidence was improper as the case was closed. As might have been expected under the circumstances, considering the blunders of the prosecution, in the ingenuous appearance of the defendant, the trial ended in a disagreement, the jury standing eight to four for a quiddle. The district attorney's office now took up a thorough investigation of the case, with the result that on a second prosecution, Mrs. Parker was confronted with a massive evidence, which it was impossible for her to refute. A boy named Wallace Sweeney sentenced to the almyra reformatory, was found to have been an active accomplice of the parkers for several years, and he was accordingly brought down to New York where he gave a complete history of his relations with them. His story proved beyond any doubt that Mrs. Parker was the forger of the checks in the possession of the district attorney, and of many others beside. Some of them for very large amounts. The evidence of Sweeney was of itself quite sufficient to warrant a conviction. To make assurance doubly sure, however, the district attorney upon the second trial moved a new indictment, setting forth as the forgery a check signed a e-bear shot so that when Parker took the stand as he had done in the former trial and testified that he was the forger. He found himself unable to write this new signature, and hence his testimony went for nothing. But even the testimony of Sweeney was that of an accomplice requiring corroboration, while that of Peabody remained the evidence of a mere policeman, eager to convict the defendant and add another scalp to his official belt. With an extraordinary accumulation of evidence, the case hinged on the veracity of these two men, to which was opposed the denial of the defendant and her husband. It is an interesting fact that in the final analysis of the case, the jury were compelled to determine the issue by evidence entirely documentary and character. It is also an illustration of what tiny facts stamp whole masses of testimony as true or false. When her examination, Mrs. Parker had sworn among other things, one that she had no knowledge of the envelope, the back of which had been used by Parker for the purpose of directing Rogers' Pete and Company to deliver the clothes and money to his messenger. And of course that the words Mr. George B. Lang were not in her handwriting. This was one of the envelopes claimed by the prosecution, to have been originally addressed in pencil and sent to themselves by the Parker's through the mail for this precise purpose. Two, that she had never seen the Couser practice sheets and that the words Alice Couser repeated hundreds of times they were on were not in her handwriting. For some reason unknown to the district attorney, however, she admitted to having written the words, I am upstairs in the bathroom upon a similar sheet, but claimed that at the time this was done, the reverse of the paper was entirely blank. Microscopic examination showed that among the words Alice and Couser on the practice sheets, someone had written a capital M. One of the legs of the M crossed and was superimposed upon a letter in the word Alice. Hence, whoever wrote the M knew what was on the practice sheet. An enlargement of this M and a comparison of it with the M in the defended signature to her formal examination in the police court, with the M in Mr. and the address on the envelope, and with that in the misses on the P-Body sheet, rendered it obvious that they were all written by one in the same hand. Therefore, it was clear that the defendant was familiar with the contents of the practice sheets, even if she had not written them herself, and had not told the truth in this regard. Moreover, it was fairly easy to see that the same hand that had written the words I am upstairs in the bathroom upon the second practice sheet had at the same time and with the same pen written the rest of the sheet. This was clearly perceptible on examining the E's and A's. A comparison of the address, Mr. George B. Lang, with the name Mrs. James D. Singley also shows clearly that one and the same person wrote them both. And to the accuracy of all these self-evident propositions, a leading handwriting expert in New York added his unqualified opinion. Thus, but for a little carelessness and failing to destroy odd scraps of paper, and to disguise her penmanship, which it seemed to her quite unnecessary to do, as in the address of the Lang and the Loop, Mrs. Parker might well have gone free after all. It is impossible to describe all the varied dramatic features of this interesting case. No one who is present is likely to forget the impression made by the defendant at her second trial. When in defiance of overwhelming proof, she still struggled to vindicate herself. Her counsel contended throughout the trial that she was a hitherto innocent young woman, let a stray and started upon a criminal career by a rascally husband, whom she still loved evadedly, and for who's sake she had prepared to confess herself a criminal. That James Parker introduced his wife to a life of crime there can be no doubt, but that she had a natural predilection for it must be equally obvious. It is probably true that Mabel Parker's affection for her convict husband was unfained and deep. The natural repugments of the American jury for convicting a woman was shown when in spite of the overwhelming proof upon the Parker woman's second trial, the jury remained out eight hours, and then found her guilty of uttering only with a strong recommendation for mercy. She was sentenced to the Bedford Reformatory. End of Chapter 1. Recording by Colleen McMahon",True Crime,English,06:49:50,Colleen McMahon,"['Dutch', 'American']","['P.

All bulldogs have their lower jaws longer than the upper. And the upper teeth come down behind the nether teeth. But Bulkka's lower jaw protruded so much that I could put my finger between the two rows of teeth. His face was broad. His eyes large, black and sparkling. And his teeth and his sizes stood out prominently. He was as black as a negro. He was gentle and did not bite. What a strong and stubborn. If he took hold of his thing, he clenched his teeth and clung to it like a rag. And it was not possible to tear him off. Any more than, as though he were a lobster. Once, he was let loose on a bear. And he got hold of the bear's ear and stuck to him like a leech. The bear struck him with his paws and squeezed him and shook him from side to side. But could not tear himself loose from him. And so he fell down on his head in order to crush Bulkka. But Bulkka held onto him until they poured cold water over. I got him as a puppy and raised to myself. When I went to the Caucasus, I did not want to take him along. And so went away from him quietly, ordering him to be shut up. At the first station I was about to change the relay. When suddenly I saw something black and shining coming down the road. It was Bulkka in his brass collar. He was flying at full speed to earth station. He rushed up to me, licked my hand and stretched himself out in the shade under the cart. His tongue stuck out a hole, handsling. He now drew it into swallow the spittle and now stuck it out again, a hole, handsling. He tried to breathe fast, but could not do so. In his sides just shook. He turned from one side to the other and struck his tail against the ground. I learned later that after I'd left he had broken a pain, jumped out of the window, and followed my track along the road, and thus raced twenty-first through the greatest heat.

As the character of a woman may be accurately deduced from her handkerchief, so a man's mental status is evident from the way he opens his mail. Curtis Keef engaged in this daily performance, slit the envelopes neatly and laid the letters down in three piles. These divisions represented matters known to be of no great interest, matters known to be important, and third, letters with contents as yet unknown, and therefore of problematic value. The first two piles were, as usual, dispatched quickly, and the real attention of the Secretary centered with pleasant anticipation on the third lot. G. Wiz, Genevieve, as no further pearls of wisdom fail from the lips of the engrossed reader of letters, the sonographer gave him a round-eyed glance and then continued her work. Curtis Keef was, of course, called Kurt by his intimates, and while it may be the obvious nickname, was brought about by his short and concise manner of speech. It is more probable that the abbreviation was largely responsible for his habit of curtainous. Anyway, Keef had long cultivated a crisp, abrupt style of conversation. That is, until he fell in with Samuel Applebee. That worthy ex-governor, while in the act of engaging Keef to be his confidential secretary, observed, they call you Kurt, do they? We'll see to it that it is short for courtesy. This was only one of several equally sound bits of advice from the same source, and as Keef had an eye single to the glory of self-advantagement, he kept all these things and pondered them in his heart. The result was that 10 years of association with lawyer Applebee had greatly improved the young man's manner, and though still brief of speech, his curtainous had lost its unpleasantly sharp edge and his courtesy had developed into a dignified urbanity, so that though still Kurt Keef, it was in name only. What's the pretty letter all about Kurti, asked the observance to anographer, who had noticed his third reading of the short, missive? You'll probably answer it soon, and then you'll know was the reply as Keef restored the sheet to its envelope, and took up the next letter. Genevieve Lane produced her vanity case and became absorbed in its possibilities. I wish I didn't have to work, she sighed. I wish I was an opera singer. Crumwell, I charged thee. Playing away ambition, murmured Keef, his eyes still scanning letters. By that sin fell the angels, and it's true you are angelic, Viva. So down you go if you fall for ambition. How you talk, ambition is a good thing. Only when tempered by common sense and perspocacity, neither of which you possess to a marked degree, who, your ambition, sure self-curtt. With the before mentioned qualifications, look here, Viva, here's a line for you to remember, I ran across it in a book. If you do only what is absolutely correct, and say only what is absolutely correct, you can do anything you like. How's that? I don't see any sense in it at all. No, I told you you liked common sense, most women do. Huh, and Genevieve tossed her pretty head, padded her curly earmuffs, and proceeded with her work. Samuel Applebee's beautiful home graced the town of Stockfield, in the western end of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Former Governor Applebee was still a political power and a man of unquestion force and importance. It was 15 years or more since he had held office, and now a great desire possessed him that his son should follow in his ways, and that his beloved state should know another governor of the Applebee name. And young Sam was worthy of the people's choice. His self-amman of 40, motherless, from childhood, and brought up sensibly and well by his father, he listened gravely to the paternal plans for the campaign. But there were other candidates, and not without some strong and definite influences could the NBA tamed. Wherefore, Mr. Applebee was quite as much interested as his secretary in the letter, which was in the morning's mail. Any word from Sikamoor Hight? He asked, as he came into the big cheerful office, and not at a kindly good morning to his two assistants. Yes, and a good word returned to Keith smiling, it says, come! The secretary's attitude toward his employer, though deferential and respectful, was marked by a touch of good fellowship, a not unnatural outgrowth of a long term of confidential relations between them. Keith had made himself invaluable to Samuel Applebee and both men knew it. So, as one had no desire to presume on the fact, and the other no wish to ignore it, Serenity reigned in the well-ordered and well-appointed offices of the ex-govener. Even the light-haired, light-hearted, and light-headed, Genevieve couldn't disturb the even tenure of the routine. If she could have, she would have been fired. Though not a handsome man, not even to be called distinguished looking, Samuel Applebee gave an impression of power. His strong lean face, be tokened, updurent, determination, and implacable will. Its deep-griven lines were the result of meeting many obstacles and surmailing most of them, and at 62, the hail and hearty frame and the alert, efficient manner, made the man seem years younger. You know the conditions on which weir lives in that house? Applebee asked as he looked over the top of the letter at Keith? No, Sir? Well, it's this way. But no, I'll not give you the story now. We're going down there today. The whole tribe, ask Keith briefly? Yes, all three of us. Be ready, Miss Lane. Please, at 330. Yes, Sir, said Genevieve, reaching for her vanity box. And now Keith, ask to young Sam. Applebee went on running his fingers through his thick, iron grey mane. If he can put it over, or if I can put it over for him, it will be only with the help of Dan Wheeler. Is Wheeler willing to help? Probably not. He must be made willing. I can do it. I think. Unless he turns stubborn. I know Wheeler. If he turns stubborn, well, Baylem's historic quadruped head, nothing on him. Does Mr Wheeler know Sam? No. And it wouldn't matter either way if he did. It's the platform Wheeler stands on. If I can keep him an ignorance of that one plank, you can't. I know it, confounded. He opposed my election on that one point. He'll oppose Sam's for the same reason. I know. Where do I come in? In a general way, I want your help. Wheeler's wife and daughter are attractive and you might manage to interest them and maybe sway their sympathies towards Sam. But they'll stand by Mr Wheeler. Probably, yes. However, use your head and do all you can with it. And where do I come in? As Genevieve, who had been an interested listener? You don't come in at all, Miss. You mostly stay out. You're to keep in the background. I have to take you for we're only staying one night at Sikamoar Ridge and then going on to Boston and I'll need you there. Yes, sir. And the blue eyes turned from him and looked absorbedly into a tiny mirror as Genevieve contemplated her pleasant pink and whiteness. Her vanity and its accompanying box were matters of indifference to Mr Applebee and to Keith. For the girl's efficiency and skill outweigh them and her diligence and loyalty scored 100%. Applebee's fetish was efficiency. He had found it and recognized it in his secretary and stenographer and he was willing to recompense it duly, even generously. Wherefore the law business of Samuel Applebee, though carried on for the benefit of a small number of clients, was a vast importance and productive of lucrative returns. At present, the importance was overshadowed by the immediate interest of a campaign, which, if successful, would land the second Applebee in the gubernatorial chair. This plan, as yet not a boom, was taking shape with neatness and dispatch that characterized the Applebee work. Young Sam was content to have the matter principally in his father's hands and things had reached a pitch where to the senior mine, the cooperation of Daniel Wheeler was imperatively necessary. And therefore, to Wheeler's house, they must be take themselves. What do you know about the Wheeler business? Kid? Keith inquired after Mr Applebee had left them. Genevieve leaned back in her chair, her dimpled chin moving up and down with a pretty wear them as she enjoyed her chewing gum and gazed at the ceiling beams. Applebee's offices were in his own house, and the one given over to these two was an attractive room, fine with mahogany and plate glass. But also provided with all the paraphernalia of the most up-to-date of office furniture. There were good pictures and draperies and a wood fire added to the chair and mitigated the chill of the early fall weather. Scyling from her seat, Miss Lane moved over to a chair near the fire. I'll take those letters when you're ready, she said. Why I don't know a single thing about any Wheeler, do you? Not definitely, he's a man who had an awful fight with Mr Applebee long ago. I've heard illusions to him now and then, but I know no details. I either, but it seems work to go there, only for a night and then on to Boston won't I be glad to go? We'll only be there a few days. I'm more interested in this Wheeler performance. I don't understand it. Who's Wheeler anyhow? Don't know. If Sammy turns up this morning, he may enlighten us. Sammy did turn up and not long after the conversation, young Applebee strolled into the office, though still looked upon as a boy by his father. The man of huge proportions and of an important slightly overbearing attitude. Someone like his parent in appearance, young Sam, as he was always called, had more grace and ease, ifless effective power. He smiled genuinely and impartially. He seemed corzual and friendly to all the world, and he was a general favorite. Yet so far, he had achieved no great thing. Had no claim to any special record in public or private life. At 40, unmarried and unattached, his was a case of an able mentality and a firm reliable character, with no opportunity offered to prove its worth. A little more initiative and he would have made opportunities for himself, but a nature that took the line of least resistance. A philosophy that believed in a calm acceptance of things as they came left Sam Applebee, Jr., pretty much where he was when he began. If no man could say ought against him, equally surely no man could say anything very definite for him. Yet many agreed that he was a man whose powers would develop with acquired responsibilities and already he had a following. Hello little one. He greeted Genevieve, carelessly as he sat down near Keith. I say oh, chap, you're going down to the wheelers today, I hear. Yes, this afternoon, and the secretary looked up inquiringly. Well, I'll tell you what. You know the governor's going there to get wheelers aid in my election boom, and I can tell you a way to help things along if you agree. See? Not yet, but go ahead. Well, it's this way. Dan wheeler's daughter is devoted to her father. Not only filial irrespect and all that, but she just fairly idolizes the old man. Now he resips, of course, and what she says goes. So I'm asking you squarely, won't you put in a good word to made a? That's the girl. And if you do it with your inimitable dexterity and grace, show fall for it. You mean for me to praise you up to Miss Wheeler and ask her father to give you the benefit of his influence? How clearly you do put things? That's exactly what I mean. It's no harm, you know. Nearly the most innocent sort of electioneering. Rather, left key. If all electioneering were as innocent as that, the word would carry no unpleasant meaning. Then you'll do it? Of course I will. If I get opportunity. Oh, you'll have that. It's a big rambling country house, a delightful one too, and there's T in the hall and tennis on the lawn and moonlight on the verendez. Hold up Sam, key for and him. Is the girl pretty? Haven't seen her for years, but probably yes, but that's nothing to you. You're working for me, you see. Applebee's glance was direct and keyf understood. Of course, I was only joking. I'll carry out your commission. If, as I said, I get the chance. Tell me something of Mr Wheeler. Oh, he's a good old chap. Pathetic, really. You see, he bumped up against Dad once and got the worst of it. How? Sam, Applebee hesitated a moment, and then said, I see, you don't know the story, but it's no secret, and you may as well be told. You listen to, Miss Lane, but there's no call to Tattle. I'll go home if you say so, Genevieve, popped up a little crispy. No, it's still. Why it was wild dad was governor about 15 years ago, I suppose, and Daniel Wheeler forged a paper. That is, he said he didn't, but 12 other good and true peers of he has said he did. Anyway, he was convicted and sentenced, but father was a good friend of his and being governor, he pardoned Wheeler, but the pardon was on condition. Oh, I say, hasn't Dad ever told you, Keith? Never. Then maybe I'd better leave it for him to tell. If he wants you to know, he'll tell you, and if not, I mustn't. Oh, goodness, cry Genevieve. What a way to go. Get us all excited over a thrilling tale and then chop it off short. Go on with it, said Keith, but Applebee said, no, I won't tell you the condition of the pardon, but the two men haven't been for instance and won't be unless the condition is removed. Of course, Dad can't do it, but the president governor can make the pardon complete, and would do so in a minute if Dad asked him to. So though he hasn't said so, the assumption is that father expects to try to fool pardon a friend Wheeler for his help in my campaign. And a good plan, Keith nodded his satisfaction, but Sam went on, the trouble is that the very same points and principles that made Wheeler oppose my father's election will make him oppose mine. The party is the same, the platform is the same, and I can't hope that the man Wheeler is not the same stubborn, adamant, unbreakable, old, hickory, not he was the other time. And so you want me to soften him up by persuading his daughter to line up on our side. Just that, Keith, and you can do it, I am sure. I'll try, of course, but I doubt if even a favorite daughter could influence the man you describe. Let me help, broken in the area, pressable, gen of Eve, I can do lots with a girl, I can do more than Kurt could, I'll chum up with her and, now, mislain, you keep out of this, I don't believe in mixing women and politics, but miswheels a woman, and I don't want her troubled with politics. Keith here can persuade her to coax her father just through her affections. I don't want her in lighten as to any of the political details, and I can't thank your influence would work half as well as that of a man, moreover, Keith has discernment, and if it isn't a good plan after all, he'll know enough to discard it, while you'd blunder a head blindly and queer the whole game. Oh, well, and briling with offended pride, Genevieve sought refuge in her little mirror. Now don't get huffy and Sam smiled at her, you'll probably find that miswheelers complexion is finer than yours anyway, and then you'll hate her and want want to speak to her at all. Mislane flashed an indignant glance and then proceeded to go on with her work. Hasn't Wheeler tried for a pardon all this time? Keith asked, In deed he has, Sam returned, many times, but you see those successive governors were willing to grant it, father always managed to prevent it. Dad can pull lots of wires as you know, and since he doesn't want Wheeler fully pardoned, why he doesn't get fully pardoned. And he lives under the stigma. Lots of people don't know about the thing at all. He lives well, he lives in Connecticut and oh of course there is a certain stigma, and your father would bring about his full pardon if he promises, let up Keith. I've said I can't tell you that part. You'll get your instructions in good time, and look here, I don't mean for you to make love to the girl. In fact, I'm told she has a suitor, but you're just to give her a little song and dance about my suitorability for the election, and then, adroitly persuade her to use her powers of persuasion with her stubborn father. For he will be stubborn, I know it, and there's the mother of the girl. Tackle Mrs Wheeler. Make her see that my father was justified in the course he took, and besides he was more or less accountable to others, and use as an argument that years have dull the old feud, and that bygone's ought to be bygone's and all that. Try to make her see that a full pardon now will be as much, and in a way more, to Wheeler's credit, then if it had been given him at first, I can't see that. And Keith looked quizzical. Neither can I, same confessed frankly, but you can make a woman swallow anything. Depends on what sort of woman Mrs Wheeler is. Keith newsed. I know it. I haven't seen her for years, and as I remember, she's pretty keen, but I'm banking on you to put over some of your clever work. Not three men in Boston have your ingenuity Keith, when it comes to sizing up a situation and knowing just how to handle it. Now don't tell father all I've said, for he doesn't especially hold with such small measures. He's all for the one big slam game, and he may be right, but I'm right too, and you just go ahead. All right, Keith agreed. I see what you mean, and I'll do all I can that doesn't in any way interfere with your father's directions to me. There's a possibility of turning the trick through the women folks, and if I can do it, you may count on me. Good, and as for you, Miss Lane, you keep in the background and make as little Miss Chief as you can. I'm not a Miss Chief Maker, said the girl, pounding playfully, for she was not at all afraid of Sam Applebee. Your blue eyes and pink cheeks make Miss Chief wherever you go, he returned, but don't try them on old-end Wheeler. He's a morose old chap. I should think he would be defended Geneva, living all these years under a ban which may, after all, be undeserved. I've heard that he was entirely innocent of the forgery. Have you indeed? Applebee's tone was unpleasantly sarcastic. Other people have also heard that, from the Wheeler family, those better informed believe the man guilty and believed too that my father was too lenient when he granted even a conditional pardon. But just think, if he was innocent, how awful his life has been all these years. You better accept the full pardon and give us all his effort and influence and any possible help in return. Here the child, all right, exclaim Sam, gazing at the enthusiastic little face as Genevieve voiced her views. I think he'll be ready to make the bargain too. Declared Chief, your father has a strong argument. I fancy Wheeler's jump at the chance. Maybe maybe so, but you don't know how opposed he is to our principles, and he's a man of immutable convictions. In fact, he and dad are too mighty strong forces. One are the other must win out, but I have no idea which it will be. How exciting Genevieve's eyes danced. I'm so glad I'm to go. It's a pretty place, you say? Wonderful, a great sweep of rolling country, a big long rambling sort of house and a splendid hospitality. You'll enjoy the experience, but remember, I told you to be good. I will remember, and Genevieve pretended to look terrific.

On the 16th day of June 1874, the ship married Jane sailed from Malta, heavy laden with cat. This cargo gave us a good deal of trouble. It was not in bales, but had been dumped into the whole loose. Captain Dobel, who had once commanded a ship that carried coals, said he had found that plan the best. In the hole was full of cat, the hatch was batten down, and we felt good. Unfortunately, the maid, thinking the cats would be thirsty, introduced a hose into one of the hatches, and pumped in a considerable quantity of water, and the cats in the lower levels were all drowned. You have seen a dead cat in a pond. Remember its circumference at the waist. On the first day out, it was observed that the ship was much strain. She was three feet wider than usual, and as much as ten feet shorter. The convexity of her deck was visually augmented for an act, but she turned up at both ends. Her rudder was clean out of the water, and she would answer to the helm only when running directly against the strong breeze. The rudder, when perverted to one side, would rub against the wind, and slew her around. And then she wouldn't steer anymore. Owing to the curvature of the keel, the mass came together at the top, and a sailor who had gone up the floor mast got bewildered, came down the mizzon mast, looked out of over the stern at the receding shores of Malta and shouted, land-ho! The ship's fastening were all giving way. The water on each side was lashing into foam by the tempest of flying bolts that she shed at every pulsation of the cargo. She was quietly wrecking herself without assistance from wind or wave, by the sheer internal energy of the fine expansion. I went to the skipper about it. He was in his favorite position, sitting on the deck, supporting his back against the binical, making a V of his legs, and smoking. Captain Dobel, I said, respectfully touching my hat, which was really not worthy of respect. This floating palace is afflicted with curvature of the spine, and likewise greatly swollen. Without raising his eyes, he curtsously acknowledged my presence by knocking the ashes from his pipe. Permit me, Captain, I said, with simple dignity, to repeat that this ship is much swollen. If that is true, said the gallant mariner, reaching for his tobacco pouch. I think it would be as well to swab her down with linemen. There is a bottle of it in my cabin. Better suggest it to the mate. But Captain, there is no time for empirical treatment. Some of the planks at the waterline have started. The skipper rose and looked out over the stern for the land. He fixed his eyes on the foaming wake. He gazed into the water to starboard and to pour. Then he said, my friend, the whole darn thing has started. Sadly, and silently I turned from the obdureth man and walked forward. Suddenly there was a burst of thunder sound. The hat that had held down the cargo was flung, whirling into space, and sailed in the air like a blown leaf. Pushing upward through the hat was a smooth square column of cat. Grandly and impressively it grew, slowly, serenely, majestically it rose toward the welcome. The relaxing keel parting at the headmask to give it a fair chance. I have stood at Naples and seen the suvious painting the town red. From Katanya have marked a far, upon the flanks of Etna, the lavise, awful pursuit. Of the astonished rooster and the despairing pig. The fiery flow from keel away as crater thrusting itself into the forest and licking the entire country clean is as familiar to me as my mother tongue. I have seen glaciers a thousand years old and quite bald, heading for a valley full of tourists at the rate of an inch of month. I have seen a saturated solution of mining camps go down a mountain river to make a sociable call on the valley farmers. I have stood behind a tree on a battlefield and seen a compact square mile of armed men moving with irresistible momentum to the rear. Whenever anything grand in magnitude or motion is built to appear, I commonly manage to beat my way into the show. When in reporting it, I am a man of unscrupulous, erasity. But I have seldom observed anything like the solid gray column of Maltese cat. It is unnecessary to explain I suppose that each individual gremalkin in the outfit, with that readiness of resource which distinguishes the species, had grappled with tooth and nail as many others as it could hook onto. This preserved the formation. It made the column so stiff that when the ship rolled and the married Jane was a devil to roll, it swayed from side to side like a mast. And the mate said, if it grew much taller, he would have to order it cut away or it would capsize us. Some of the sailors went to work at the pumps, but these discharge nothing but fur. It was indomal raised his eyes from his toes and shouted, let go the anchor. But being assured that nobody was touching it, apologized and resumed his reverie. The chaplain said if there were no objections, he would like to offer up a prayer, and a gambler from Chicago produced a pack of cards, proposing to throw round for the first jack. The Parsons plan was adopted, and as he uttered the final A man, the cats struck up him. All the living ones were now above deck, and every mother's son of them sang, each had a pretty fair voice, but no ear. Nearly all their notes in the upper register were more or less cracked and disobedient. The remarkable thing about the voices was their reign. In that crowd were cats of 17 octaves, and the average could not have been less than 12. Number of cats per invoice, 127,000 estimated number of dead swelters, 6,000. Total sunstered, 121,000. Which number of octaves per cat, 12? Total octaves, 1452,000. It was a great concert. It lasted three days in nights, or counting each night of seven days, 24 days altogether. And we could not go below for provisions. At the end of that time, the cook came forward, shaking up some beans in a hat, and holding a large knife. Sheetmates, he said. We have done all that mortals can do. Let us now draw lots. We were blindfolded in turn, and drew. But just as a cook was forcing the fatal black bean upon the fattest man, the concert closed with a suddenness that waked the man on the lookout. A moment later, every Gomalten relaxes his hold on his neighbors, the column lost its cohesion, and, with 121,000 dull, sickening thuds that beat his one, the whole business fell to the deck. Then with a wild farewell whale that feline hosts sprang spinning into the sea, and struck out southward for the African shore. The southern expansion of Italy, as every schoolboy knows, resembles in shape in enormous booth. The cats in the fabric had spided, and there alert imaginations were instantly affected with a lively sense of the size, weight, and probable momentum of its flung bootjack.

The Book of the Dead,E. A. Wallis Budge,41461,37.0,"August 18, 2018",['\n        Thank you for the recording.       '],1," Recording by Patrick Sivil. The Book of the Dead by EA Wallace Bunch. Two Sir Edward Maud Thompson, KCB, DCL, LLD, Principal Eberian of the British Museum. Dear Sir Edward, with great pleasure I amvil myself of the opportunity of inscribing our name at the head of this work on the Thibian recession of the Book of the Dead for you have taken no ordinary interest in its inception and progress in completion. I do it the more gladly because I know that everything which concerns the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians and the wonderful doctrine of the resurrection of the spiritual body and of its everlasting existence, which they evolved thousands of years before our era has the greatest attraction for you. It is now many years ago since your friendship with our common friend, the late professor W. Wright began and your helpful sympathy with his various oriental works was never wanting. The like friendship and the like sympathy you have extended to myself, his pupil. For both I thank you and I subscribe myself, grateful the yours, EA Wallace Bunch, London July 27th, 1897. Preface. The present volume forms part of a work on the Thibian recession of the Book of the Dead which I have prepared for Missiers, Kigan Paul and Company with a view of supplying an addition of Egyptian text and howrglyphic, a full bouquet of library to the same with copious references and a complete translation with introductory chapters upon the history, object and contents of the Book of the Dead and a handy form and at a moderate price. It is the most complete addition of the Thibian recession, Hitherto Paul Bushed, but further discoveries in Egypt may at any moment result in the recovery of a pyreye containing chapters that present unknown to us. The texts of the Heliopolitan recession of the Book of the Dead are the fifth and sixth dynasties which are inscribed upon the pyramids of Yunus, Tetta, Pepe the First, Meran Ra and Pepe the Second and which may be regarded as the most ancient form of the work now known to us have been published. Together with French translations of them by Missier Maspero in the various volumes of, Recre, Detrago and separately under the title of Les inscription de Pyrimin de Sikara Paris 1894. The texts of the recession in use during the 11th and 12th dynasties which are found inscribed upon the coffins of the period have been published by Laptis and Maspero in an excellent idea of their contents may be gained from Birch's translation of the texts on the coffin of Amamu published with a complete facimili by the trustees of the British Museum under the title Egyptian texts of the earliest period from the coffin of Amamu, London 1886. The texts of the Fibre recession which was in use from the 18th to 22nd dynasties for example from about BC 1600 to BC900 and which is found inscribed on several coffins both plain and illuminated have been published by Birch, Maryette, Lehman, Devaria and others and an eclectic addition of the recession and use from the 18th to the 20th dynasties was published with variants and Anelentong by Missier, Navil and 1886. Translations of single pyri belonging to this period have been published by Devaria and Pyre, Gease, Defarbra, Masae, Priet and others and certain chapters of this recession have been translated in discuss by various Egyptologists. Texts both heratic and hergalithic which were copied and illustrated for the priests and the precesses of Amam during the 21st and 22nd dynasties have been published by Birch, Lehman, Devaria, Maryette and Maspero and a fine example of the heratic manuscript of the period following entitled Rich Uel, Fumiel was published by E. De Ruge and 1861. Of the texts which represent the site, recession of the book of the dead, several manuscripts have been printed and described. The most important of these however is the famous papyrus preserved at Turin of which lepsis published a good copy as far back as 1842 entitled Daatopenbach, Dejipter. The book of the dead which was in use throughout the Greco-Woman and Roman periods is well illustrated by the heratic texts published and transcribed by Birch in the proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Volume 7, Page 49. And by Libyan and his Delefra, Ejipteri, Kuhmau, Nathleris, Lepsiig, 1895. The first to publish a complete translation of any recession of the book of the dead was Birch, who in 1867 gave an English version of the Turin papyrus in the fifth volume of Bunsen, Ejip's place, and Universal History, pages 123 through 333. Notwithstanding the fact that the recession here translated as a site or latest of all in the text of the Turin manuscript is faulty in many places. Birch's rendering gave a new impulse to the study of the Egyptian religion and it has formed the groundwork of the translations made by Ejipteriologists subsequently. The thing to wonder at is not the mistakes which he made, but that he was able at that early date to translate so much correctly. In 1882, Pire, published a French translation of the Turin papyrus entitled Delefra, Demorts, De Asians, Ejipteri, in 1894, gave us published an English version of Pire's French translation at New York. Up to the present, however, no complete translation of the Theban recession has appeared. Translations of single papyrus, for example, the papyrus of Nebceni, the papyrus of Ani, the papyrus of Sutlamese, the papyrus of Nebcad, etc. have been made by Deberia and Pirei, Gease, Messe, myself and others, and a translation of the text published by Deville in his Totenbach and by others was begun by Renew, in the proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Volume 14. Since the appearance of Neville's Great Work in 1886, several extremely important papyrus have been discovered and is now possible to add to the texts of the Theban recession, which you published against a total number of chapters, etc. From the papyrus of Ani, we obtained instructions to chapters 18 and 125, a hemtera, a hemtoasaurus, text referring to the judgment scene, all of which are new, besides these we gain from it a complete, though short, version of chapter 175, and the vignettes are colored with a care and beauty, hitherto unknown and papyri of this class. Of greater interest, textually, however, is the papyrus of Neu, which the trustees of the British Museum acquired in 1890. It is, I believe, the oldest of illuminated papyrus I known, and it certainly was written in the first half of the period of the rule of the kings of the 18th dynasty. It is nearly, if not quite, as old as the famous papyrus of Neppesene, unlike many of the papyrus of that day, it was written throughout by one man, probably knew himself. As in all papyrus, lions were emitted here and there, and in one short chapter is repeated in it, however, or about 20 chapters of the Thibian recession, which have not hitherto been found, and several which have, up to the present, been only known to exist in single manuscripts. From the above facts, it is clear that in addition of the text of the Thibian recession, which should contain all such new chapters, etc, was needed. When a few years ago Sir E. Mond Thompson suggested to me to make a translation of the book of the dead for popular use, I decided to do so, and to publish at the same time, in addition of the Egyptian texts. For in these days, the reader insists and rightly upon the reproduction of the original documents as far as possible, so that he may be able to control the rendering set forth by the translator. Since Nil papyrus contains all the chapters of the Thibian recession and no two papyrus agree either, in respect of contents or arrangement of the chapters, and the critical value of every text in a papyrus is not always the same. It follows that a complete addition of all the known chapters of the Thibian recession is impossible unless recourse, be had to several papyrae. I have therefore made use of several, and as a result, translations of about 160 chapters, not including different versions, hymns and rubrics, are given in the present volume. I have also added translations of 16 chapters of the Satay recession, both because the form good specimens are the religious compositions of the latter period, and illustrates some curious beliefs, and because, having adapted the numbering of the chapters employed by Lepsius, they were needed to make the numbering of the chapters in this addition consecutive. My translation has been made as literal as possible, my aim being to let the reader judge for himself the contents of the Thibian book of the dead, as it is intended for papyrus, I have not encumbered the pages with fulluminous notes, nor have I attempted to explain the illusions in obscurities which no man at present understands. For references to the works of other writers, the reader is referred to the Bibbiography at the end of my papyrus of Ani, in the British Museum London 1895, into the notes, and the introduction to that work. The source of each chapter is set forth clearly above it, together with the description of the vineyard to it as it is found in the best papyrus of the 18th and 19 dynasties. Since the vineyards formed originally no part of the book of the dead, no attempt has been made to reproduce them here. A collection of all the vineyards found in the Thibian papyrus, especially those which are found in the books of the dead, made for the priests of Alman after BC when thousands would be of great value, but unless they were be produced in their actual colors, much of their interest would be lost. The whole judgment scene and the Alizian fields and the portion of the vineyard, the first chapter have, however, been beautifully reproduced in full colors, been Mr. W. Griggs from the papyrus of Ani and these form excellent examples of the artistic work executed upon papyri in the 18th dynasty. Those who require other examples are referred to the second edition of the colored facimili of the papyrus of Ani, published by the trustees of the British Museum in 1894. In the introduction, a sketch of the history of the growth and development of the book of the dead has been given into illustrate the paleography of the different recessions from about BC-3500 to about AD-218 plates have been depended. The remaining brief accounts of some of the religious views of the Egyptians are necessary the understanding of the aim and object of the book of the dead. They would have been fuller had space permitted and are reserved a more detailed description of them for a further work on the Egyptian religion. With the view of showing how, in the total mayic period and later times, the Egyptians hoped to obtain for their dead all the benefits which were believed to be secured for them by the use of the numerous chapters of earlier periods by means of a work which, the extremely short, preserved all the essential beliefs of an old-time, a translation has been added of the book of briefings from the text of the papyrus of Karasher, British Museum number 9,995. By means of this, in the extracts from the pyramid texts, given in my chapter on the leasing fields, a comparison of the beliefs of the Egyptians in the earliest and latest times can be made. In a small volume accompanying the text of the Thibian recession will be found of vocabulary containing over 35,000 references which has been bound up separately and difference to the wishes of many. In the case of uncommon words, every example of its use which occurs in the book is noted. For commoner words, copious references are given in order that the breeder may the more easily compare their meanings in several passages. Finally, it is my duty to express my grateful thanks to the trustees of the British Museum for permission to print certain chapters of the papyrus of Nabsene and of the papyrus of Ani from the publications issued by them. My thanks are also to do to Mr. Holhausen of Iyana for the care which he has bestowed upon the printing of the three parts of this work. And to Mr. Griggs for the colored reproductions from the papyrus of Ani, which he has executed with his usual skill.

Lanagan Amateur Detective,Edward H. Hurlbut,230949,,"April 14, 2018",[],0," volunteer please visit Libravox.org, recording by David Wales. Lannigan, Amateur Detective, by Edward H. Hurlbutt. Story I, wither thou goest. My clan again, of the San Francisco inquire, was conceded to have arrived as the premier police reporter of San Francisco. This honor was his and not solely through a series of brilliant newspaper feeds in his special field, but as well by reason of an entonged at that permitted him to call half the patrolman on the forest by their given names, enjoy the confidence of detective sergeants, a closed mouth brotherhood, done a tata-tate and private at French restaurants with well-groomed police captains on canvas back or quay a lot of season, and sit nonchalantly on a corner of the chief's desk and abset-mindedly smoke up the chief's two bits of guards. It was an intimacy that carried much of the lore of the forest with it, that vital knowledge not of books. Bill D'Oerdee on the palm-broken detail, new scarcely morphances, then did Lannigan. Charlie Hartley, who handled the bunk-o detail, found himself nettleed now and then, when Lannigan would pick him up casually at the ferry building and point out some worker among the incoming rustics whom Hartley had not made, and a debonair, Hario Bryan, who spent his time among the banks, was more than once rudely jard when Lannigan would slip over on the front page of the inquire, a defocation that had been engaging O'Brien's attention for a week. So it went with Lannigan, from the bell-hops of big hotels, the barboys of clubs, down to the coldest-blooded, un-panned felon of the barbery coast, who sold impossible whiskey with one hand, and wielded a blackjack with the other, the police sources were his. Consequently, Lannigan, having arrived, may be accorded a few more liberties than the average reporter, and permitted to spend a little more time than they, and poker in the back room, at Fogretis, hard by the hall of justice. Here, when times were dull, he could drift occasionally to fraternize with a shester, those buzzards of the police courts and the city prisons who served Fogretis, or with one of the police court prosecuting attorneys affiliated with the Fogreti political machine, for Fogreti was popularly credited with having at least two, possibly three of the police judges in his vest pocket. Or he could rattle the dice with a police judge himself and get the inside on a closed door hearing, or the latest complaint on the secret file, and he could keep in touch with the plaincloseman, who dropped in to pass the time of day with Fogreti, or with the patrolman coming on and off watch, who reported to Fogreti as regularly as they dawned and doft their belts and helmets, things they thought Fogreti should know. In this fashion, does the police reporter best serve his paper, for it is, by such unholy contact, that he keeps in touch with the circles within circles of the police department of a great city. Some he handles by fear, some he wins by favor, and some he weedles. In the end, if he be a brother post-graduate, the grist of the headquarters mill is his. Of the shasters, there is Horace Lathripe for instance, who boasts a Harvard degree when he is drunk. Never when he is sober. Horace is sitting with land again at Fogreti's rear room table while land again, sips moodily at his drink. Larry the rat, runner for the shasters, pasty of face, flat of forehead, as of chin, with an upper lip, whose mouth formation suggests unpleasantly, the road unto his name he bears, shuffles in and be speaksly through a pat length. That were these straightens up, glances at land again, and then remarks, cases just brought in a mall, and arouses with elaborate unconcern to leave the room. Well, drold, land again, what else? Nothing, that's all I know, going to try to get the case now, whatever it is, is that all you told him, Larry, asked Lannigan, the rat mumbled unintelligibly and shuffled away. The rats answered after his breed, said Lannigan, he says no, it is not. Now Horace pardon me, Barastur laythrup, kick through, you know, I've got to deliver a story to my paper today. Come on, Lannigan never wasted words with laythrup. There were a few trivialities that he had on that individual, but laythrup bolt. Look here, Lannigan, all I got, sir, name and address, it isn't square. She may have a role as long as you're armed. You print this story, the newspaper man, go at her for interviews, tip her off about me, she gets a regular lawyer and where do I come off? You fellas are always crapping our game. I gave you that shoplifter story a week ago and you played it for a column. You know you did, Jack. Now you know you did. Laythrup had been whining. Now he stiffened, I ain't going to, defiantly. I'm tired of being bullied by you. Bah, say no, Jack. It's a big case and I got a wife and kids to look out for, which was a fact. And area come, taken the bread and butter out of their mouths. It ate square Jack, you know, it ain't. All morals to all men reflected Lannigan and laughed lazily pulling a copy of the inquire across the table. See here, are us right on this page. Page one, column two, right here with your name and big black face letters, a little story of about one-third of a column on that $750 touch off on that Oraville Deacon who went a stray for the first time of his life and was pinched as a drunk to be fleased by you and your precious band. There ain't any way I get in his money back or prove in a case against you or the two cops who cut the rule with you and Foguri. I didn't print this story, but I've got the facts pretty straight and it goes right here. Right and this nice, conspicuous place for the grand jury to see and for that wife and those kids to see also who singular as it may sound. Actually don't know what particular round of all lawyers you are. Get all that? Lathrup got it. Lannigan was then told that the dead end of cells held a young woman of remarkable beauty, Miss Grace Turner, taken from a family rooming house on Opharrell Street, also that through Lathrup, word of her arrest, was to be taken to her brother there. Lathrup, or Larry the Rat, both being cogs in the same machine, had come by the information by the underground wire that runs from every city prison to the bail bond operators and their shicters without. Foguri was the bail bond chief and possibly one of the plain clothesmen who just now arrested his elbow upon the bar may have passed that name and address to Larry the Rat. The dead new cases are those on the secret book at headquarters that stable police violation of Magna Carta. So dead new cases therefore become the focus of the police reporters' activity. And incidentally Horus used stay away from 1153 a Opharrell Street until I get through was Lannigan's final command. But what about Foguri? Mind the Shester. They must know by this time I got the case. You know what he could do to me if he wanted to jack? Yes, and I know what I could do to him if I wanted to and he knows it to. And that Lannigan leave him to me. I'm a friend of misterners he said as the land lay the open the door at 1153 a Opharrell. I wish to speak with her brother. He'll be glad to see you. He has been worrying. Y'a ain't another one of them detectives. I didn't tell him, though. He was asleep in the doctor's edition. Be worried just now. It might be fatal. What do they do with a poor dear girl? Nearly holding her for a few hours. What was the trouble? Given a bad check to the drug us from medicine, she did the same thing at the grocers. Said dirty trick I say to arrest the poor thing. Why the grocers bill was only a few dollars. They don't eat enough to keep my canary. The man eats mostly almonds. Something wrong with his stomach and that seems to be all he can eat. Funny added. The garalist woman led Flannigan to a doorway in the rear. He knocked and in response to a feeble voice entered. Prop Top with two pillows was a young man whose wasted features were bright with a hectic flush. Whose arms hanging loosely from his gown were shrunk to the bone and sin use. The eyes were gray, steady, and assured. So much so that Lanigan half-halted on the threshold as he felt the response in his own sensitive brain to the personality that flashed to him through those eyes. The man of mental power, thought Flannigan, of swift decision and of iron will. The voice was little more than a gasp, but each word by effort was clearly uttered. You're an upper office man? No, I am a newspaper man. Why did you ask that? Because they were here and took my sister for overdrawn what little funds we had in back. There was concentrated fury in his weak voice. Still, I am curious to know how you knew they were playing close men that took her. How? A newspaper man asked how? Because they walk like a ton of piglet and didn't that curse it to grow circumcised to have arrested for a poultry for $5. I heard her scream when they took her. This, more quietly with a slight shrug and a comprehensive gesture to indicate his wasted form and flushed cheeks. This particular complaint serves to strengthen our outer faculties for a while, at least, even if it is at the expense of our inner ones. I take it your sister is bringing you from the interior to the south. Yes, we came from South Dakota. We were robbed of our tickets on our first night here. She has been trying to get something to do to save money enough to get as far as Los Angeles. It came on me suddenly, alcohol helping, sister, when they turned me out. On general principles, I don't blame father, I gambled a mortgage onto the old ranch and 20 years onto his head. Anyway, here we are, sister and me. That's what you fellas on the papers call a human interest story, isn't it? There was something about the measured and sinister tone that told of the bitterness of a baffled strong man in the face of a situation that he was powerless to avoid. Lannigan wondered what that man would have done or tried to do to him if he were in full possession of his strength. He judged from those level gray eyes that the session would not be uninteresting. Yes, it might be a human interest story, said Lannigan, and then again it might be better than a human interest story. He was looking at the tip of a cigar, flicking the ashes from it, as he said it, but he caught the swift, suddenly veiled flash that the keen eyes shot to his face. To all appearances though, Lannigan did not see that glance, he had not liked the ready talk about upper office men, and he would take oath that in the wasted features around the ears and the neck, where the tell-tale traces of that prison power that requires a many a long day to wear away. For instance, Lannigan continued to still flicking at his cigar tip, if you were being kept undercover here. It was only a swift partial intake of breath, but Lannigan caught it, and then the man spoke so easily and smoothly that the newspaper man believed himself deceived, well, I am. That's a bet. But just until SIS can get me away, that's also a bet. Then their follow-deetails, the man on the pillows, supplying with facility, a pedigree that went back to the Mayflower. Lannigan, the had to be fishing, yet as he left the room, he was uneasy and far from being satisfied. As the story stood, it was a neat little human interest story, as Harry Turner had said, and worth a column and a half. He had comforted Turner to the extent of informing him that the Shisers had his sister's case and would probably have her out before night. He drifted to moodily back to police headquarters, their laythrup met him. Nothing stirring, he said disgustedly, that Turner loose. Grosser won't prosecute. She's got a sick brother. Don't think she was alive one anyway. Lannigan ground one palm into the other. Three quarters of the story was gone with the woman free, and his hunch was a float without an anchor. He drifted into chief Leslie's office and helped himself to a cigar. Chief, what did you have on that Turner girl? Leslie was past being surprised at anything Lannigan knew. He stopped studying a police circular long enough to look up. Couple are little checks, but the complaining witness withdrew. I wouldn't write her up if I were you. She's one case entitled to sympathy. I talked to her. They're a bread that girl, consumptive brother, taking himself. So I turned her loose. Leslie fell to setting his circular again, and Lannigan drew up a chair to look over the circular also, a little privilege he alone enjoyed of the newspaper men at headquarters. Then he whistle softly. Lannigan was past being surprised at anything, almost. That whistle was about his most demonstrative exhibition. The circular was from Denver, and offered to $5,000 reward for information that leading to the arrest and conviction of Harry Short, wanted for highway robbery and murder. The details of a Denver crime that a brief time before had shocked the country were given, and the customary police description with the front and profile pictures from the Rogues Gallery. Would probably be found with a woman, the circular red, posing as his wife or sister? They followed a description of the woman, Cecil Andrews, and her history. She was the daughter of a country minister who became enamored of short when he did odd jobs about her father's place. She had refused to give him up when he was charged with triple murder. In some way it was believed she had managed to join him in hiding, for she had disappeared as completely as he. Cecil finally became annoyed at Lannigan's prolonged whistle. Good heavens, Jack. He said irrestably. I'm trying to get these descriptions in my head. Take that whistle outside. All right. But, say chief, at the tone was tense, drawn taught, like a fiddle string, Leslie wheeled. Lannigan's eyes were lighting up with that curious brightness that flamed there when the strange brain of the man was at work. And there was action promised when the torturous maces of some enigma were unfolding to that inner sight. Say chief, he went on, and wonder if I could make a trip, say to Paris, on about one half of that reward, I've always had a curiosity to study that Paris police system. I don't approve of newspaper men taking blood money. It isn't in our game. But it might be proper to take about one half of that money in a case like this for a trip, like that. What do you think? Leslie's eyes were searching Lannigan's. He knew of old that Lannigan was not a quibblur, and that he never wasted words. He got something Jack. What is it? Him said Lannigan, in elegantly, tapping the face upon the circular. Leslie jumped straight up out of it chair. The police reporter lit a fresh cigar from Leslie's top desk drawer where the good ones were. It's this way chief, but the story's mine. Mine, absolutely. You've brought me the tip, the story's yours. That's the way I play the game. Said Leslie. This woman was the girl you arrested. Her brothers out in a rooming house on a ferro street laid up with consumption, galloping to it appears to me. Leslie was an explosive man and after a swift glance through the circular description of the woman again, he expressed himself volubly and with an auction. He never occurred to him to question the accuracy of Lannigan's statements. He would have taken the newspaper man's word over that of one of his own men. Lannigan, telephone to Samson, a city editor of the inquirer, and before that cold blooded individual could get in a word, Lannigan had said enough to indicate to Samson that something choice was on the iron. Lannigan had asked for me and I was detailed to report to him in 30 minutes at Venice Avenue and Eddy. Ed was just 30 minutes later that the chief, Lannigan, Brady, Wilson, and Maloney, three of Leslie's steadiest thief takers and myself, were dropping singly into 1153 A. O'Ferrell Street. Lannigan having preceded us to reassure the Lann lady. Maloney went on through to take the alleyway, the room having a window over the alley, softly and swiftly we masked before the door. Lannigan took the door, wrapping. There was no answer. The chief signaled for a rush. Leslie never carried about one gun, and this he now rested in the hollow of his left arm. He towered above and behind us as we noisesly wedged against the old fashioned, slimsy door. My heart was beating like a trip hammer. I never seemed to be able to get over that thumping just before the opening engagement when I am elected to make a target of myself. I confess freely that I always went into those thrillers with Lannigan in the full expectation of getting my own name and picture in the papers and the complimentary designation usually a quarter to man of my profession by the paper he served when Miss Hath befolls him. Our reporter who was killed. The chief breathed a soft command, the wedge crashed, the bolts burst and we were in, an empty room. There was an awkward pause, it seemed to me for an hour. It may have been, but a minute, while Leslie slipped back into his holster that ugly gun of his. Lannigan was turning slowly, examining every corner of the room. His eyes were living, snapping fire. I guess chief, he drold. I won't make the reservations today for that little drip of mine. The bed was unmade, but the room showed no traces of recent occupation, save several empty medicine bottles from which the labels had been washed, and on a closet shelf, a paper sack, half full of almonds. There were almond shells on the floor. For the rest, the room held but the ordinary pertinentes of a room of its kind, washed and bowl, towels and rack, and chief dresser. The Lann lady was summoned, she was more surprised than Lannigan, or the chief. She had not seen the girl return. But not seen the pair depart. Had believed that the man was too sick to leave his bed. Galvanic Leslie within an hour had men at the ferry building, at the third and towns and street depot covering every boat house that had launches or tugs for hire. The suburban electric lines were covered, and the country roads leading south. The great man trap that so easily can be thrown around the peninsula of San Francisco, the trap that time and again has caught the thieves of the world when they have fled for a haven to the western coast, metropolis, was set. And yet so quietly was the work done, so implicitly had Leslie impressed upon every district captain, every detective, every patrolman, concerned with the story, the necessity for absolute secrecy that not one of the other great papers of San Francisco knew that the jaws of that trap were gaping hungrily. Probably there was no reporter save Lannigan, who could have broken into that story, once Leslie had commanded his men to secrecy. They knew what disloyalty to that disciplinary and lament too well to trifle with him. Within the city proper, plain clothesmen by shoals flooded every hotel and barging house that might by any possibility harbor the pair. The hospitals were watched, half a dozen doctors known to Leslie, worked among their professional brothers, but no one was attending such a man as Turner. And the wonder grew to Lannigan at that story scattered now well over the city, was even yet escaping the innumerable sources of news of the times, and the braggard herald to say nothing of the evening papers the record and the tribune. In such fashion though, by grace of a newspaper luck, or the greatest success is scored after they have knocked around under the very feet of half the newspaper men of a city. Of that army of plain clothesmen, none worked harder than Lannigan. For days I did not see him, sometimes I would locate him in the foulless sinks of the barberry coast or Chinatown. Here with products brewed in some witches' cauldron, he would be in fraternity, trying ceacelessly to tap that underground wire by which the convict, bade in a great city, sends word to his kind. But always he failed. Kidman-han, labored in vain, read Murphy credited with knowing more thieves than all the coasts' saloon men put together could secure no trace. Turner, or short, had found no refuge in the hutsches of the drug or the opium fiends. An again-that-met-men who should have been in San Quentin, one-night he crossed slivers Martin, who had broken from a deputy sheriff and escaped a ten-year sentence. Slivers was waiting until he could get out of the city, yet even slivers knew nothing of such a one as Turner. Finally, Lannigan turned his attention to the residence sections. At times he would drag me with him. For hours he would ramble up one street and down another, always trying the fruit stands, the grocery stores, the delicate testin stores, and always he asked one question, did a blonde young woman with dark blue eyes, blue tailored suit, quick nervous walk, come in and buy nuts, particularly almonds. A dozen times, the answer was yes, and when the customer was not known to the proprietor, Lannigan would take up his watch tireless in the fathomable and wait until that person appeared or passed on the street. Always he met with failure. Lannigan always gone, became cadaverous, for four days, I lost him. I worried and spent my night trying to locate him, but his old hunts knew him not. One day there came a call for me. You, Nory, it was Lannigan's voice, it sounded thin and tired. I've landed, come to Eddie and Venice, get your gun. A quick shiver went over me, the climax had come. I borrowed Samson's gun, having left mine home. Heard from Lannigan heavier, asked the austere individual, I nodded, has he landed? Yes, good luck, said Samson, his eyes sparkling. He knew that Lannigan's pride after the first fiasco prevented his ringing up until the story was clenched. Give Lannigan my regards, let us hear from you, it is not necessary to tell either you or Lannigan to do your best for speed. Samson, reckoned the coldest bladed city editor in the west, was yet the most responsive to a story. He was a driver, but he knew how to human men. I disliked him personally and would avoid him out of the office, but in harness would have worked both legs to the ankle for him. Most of them in on his staff had that fanatical loyalty for him as a city editor, yet outside they seldom spoke to him, saved to Dan, curious breed reporters, to his credit as a city editor in all of those two weeks he had not complained. He spoke about him again to me only twice. He knew I was worried and knew I think that I had spent many a night searching for him, finally to appear for work without sleep. But he knew that Lannigan was out for the paper first, last and all the time, knew that that bloodhound quality of sticking to the trail would never let him quit till he had proved that there was no way of landing the story. Lannigan's appearance shocked me. He had not shaved for a week, rings under his eyes, red-litded for warmth of sleep. His pale cheeks held an unhealthy flush, and he coughed once or twice in a fashion I did not like, but that old magnetic smile was there. Scared as a rabbit out bed and wishing you did your July 1st he left, pulling me into a doorway, then more seriously, nor I am just a wandering hook, a derelict, whatever you will, my passing would be nothing to a sole honor. I had never heard Lannigan speak in that way. No sole on earth he repeated. Then he swept me with those luminous eyes of his, and they were as clear and as unclouded as my own. I knew that I had caught a swift glimpse as the shutter opened upon the vista of his fast, that secret passed, that now I understood. For a moment I was conscious of nothing, save that this man whom I loved like a brother was in pain, and I could do nothing for him. With his swift perceptions, Lannigan had caught my mood and on hands met. That lean sinewy hand was as firm as steel. Then with his fassal art he had thrown aside his humor of introspection and spoke briskly. Noray, I don't want to tangle you with this against your will. This man, I believe, is the hardest game this city has held in my time or yours. He will die with his stockings on. It looks like gunplay. Frankly I was for quitting inwardly, outwardly because of that amismaric way of his, that teasing superior tone I was all for the climax. Besides, I did not want to leave him to himself in that humor to go into a mess. I knew his reckless ways to well. He walked rapidly up eddy street and turned on Franklin until near the corner of Opharo, where entering a flat Lannigan led the way to the top story. Here we entered an unfinished alcohol room in the rear with a dormer window covered by a heavy curtain of burlap. The slightest possible rant had been made in the curtain, Lannigan told me to look. Opposite was a dormer window corresponding to our own. The next house being one of similar design. The alley between was possibly ten feet. Our window was the only one that could command the other. In the opposite house, the curtain was a ordinary heavy lace. After peering intently for a time, I could distinguish through it a woman's figure and a bed upon which a form could be discerned. There you are, Nory. That man shows his caliber by moving round the corner from his former home while the police look for him elsewhere. He knows by now the police descriptions are here that I must have recognized him and that the hunt is on. My almond trail landed when I came back to this territory just on the final chance that the man was big enough to figure out that his sure-safe delay right here. She has been out but a few times buying those eternal almonds. Maltod milk has been added to his diet too. I picked her up, trailed her, and the rest was easy. The man's stomach is gone. Incidentally, they owe a week's rent there, and she is living mostly on almonds now too. So I guess the eggschicker is pretty low. I didn't suppose there were any more women left in a world like that. This girl, born of a good family, daughter of a minister, takes up with that triple-stained murderer and sticks. She surely took that armor and obey in epic earnest if she married him, if not, why the more credit to her for sticking. It isn't for us to judge, nor I keep your eye glued to that hole while I go into the next room. I've rented this attic by the way, and grind out copy. It was four o'clock then, at nine, a land against ceased writing, he had made and long hand, six thousand words, of as clean cut, brilliant and narrative story of its kind, as under similar pressure has ever appeared in print. As in all of Lannigan's stories, it was at the police who had learned this and that. Lannigan has made several detective sergeants in his time. Leslie will meet us here at 1 o'clock. We must keep the smash until two, fire the story at Simpson by telephone to lead off my stuff with, hold them in the room until three, and we beat the town again. He hurried out to return in half an hour. He had telephone to Simpson, that the story would break about two o'clock, and to hold the paper until he had heard from us. Then he had sent his copy down by messenger boy, and loaded up on a bundle of the choices of the rank brand of Manila's, he chose at times to affect. I noticed, as he lit a match, that his hands shook. I wanted him to lie down until one, but his only answer was to fix me with those eyes of his glowing like a cat's in the darkness. We were smoking with the lighted ends of our cigars, held inside our hats. So careful was Lannigan, at least any trace be given to the opposite room, and he laughed that curious laugh of his. When this is over, nori, he said, I'll sleep for a week. Half that 5,000 is mine. You, unless the and the others, can divide the rest. Really, I saw Lannigan in my minds, I already snooping, and, prying around those fairs by ways, it sounded too assured, as he said it. I wondered whether I cared for blood money, figured that I would accept it, and began pleasantly in the gloom to spend my bit with much contentment. I concluded I would accompany Lannigan on that fairer strip. When a clock came and with it Leslie, Brady, Wilson and Maloney. Brady was put at the aperture, a faint light in the opposite room, brought the two figures out into bold relief. The rest of us moved to the outer room, where the plain clothesmen slipped their revolvers to their side coat pockets. I wished, loom simley, that I had brought two, and that I might feel braver, although I had, as much chance of shooting a revolver with my left hand, without disaster, as of sailing and aeroplane with either. At that, I believe I would have felt more in the picture with two. The plan was to pull a fire alarm, and as soon as the engines clattered into the street, scatter to the top story, wrap on the door as if to warn the occupants, take them off their guard when the door was open, and the thing was done. That program was carried out. When the apparatus swung up from Oferro, filling the still night air with those strident bells of terror and alarm, we sped to the top floor and made the corridor fire fire. It was Brady's horse voice, and even I thrilled it was done so realistically. I, as the one most likely unknown to the pair, had been selected to take their door. I wrapped loudly and shouted the alarm, Brady was on one side of me, Lannigan, on the other Wilson, Maloney, and the chief on either side, again in the dark hall, flattened to the wall, guns drawn ready for the rush. The door opened as six inches, a startled one face with lustrous blue eyes shining vividly above deep circles of black, looked into mine through the aperture, possibly something in my face, possibly an native suspicion and fear, and do stir to assay to slam the door. I pushed my shoulder to the door and shoved, Brady at one shoulder, Lannigan at the other. She gave back, with one more wide eye to look that went over my shoulder, and caught the gray bearded chief, known to her, huddled back for fear of that very thing. There came one shrill scream, Harry, the police, and she had turned and fled, and we pushed in vain, the door was chained. One united crash again, the fascinants gave, just as the slight figure quicker than a swallow, had darted within the inner room, and slammed the door shut in our faces, a bolt shot to place, as a bullet from within tore through the paneling, and clipped the rim of Brady's hat, and that towering figure bore back out of range, and swung us in a mass with him. Two more shots tore through and sprayed us with splinters. We flattened against the wall. The jig is up short, you may as well come out. It was Leslie, a calm, as if he were delivering orders to his chauffeur. A shot rewarded him, impenging parapheraously close to his shoulder. The man within was dying with the convict's last desperate ambition to take a policeman with him. We dropped flat. There was a pause while Brady and Leslie counseled in whispers, whether to risk a rush. The silence became acute, punctuated now, and then, by whistbrings from the inner room. It sounded as if she were pleading with him, his note of finality could not be mistaken, although the words were not heard. Other silence, and then to our straining ears, rising clearly above the den and clamor of doors below stairs, opening and shutting of shouting and excited cries, came a trembling voice floating through the jagged holes of the inner door, trembling with the strength or the ardor of a determination, rather than any dread or fear. Then Harry, take me to, take me to, no, to seal, no. There was silence again from within, and again that voice now touched with pleading still, more earnest. It is only right, Harry dear, all that the world held I sacrificed for you, if you don't take me, I will follow you. Prolonged to acuteness became the silence again. The man's voice, horse, gasping, finally came, praise a seal. And again that voice, trembling, yet clear as the beautiful sweeping cords of a harp, came floating with the accurate revolver smoke through the jagged, ugly rants in the paneling, and seemed to flood the room with something almost like a visible radiance, our father, who ought in heaven. I saw Maloney with his blue nose revolver in hand, have risen, make the sign of the adoration, his forehead and his chest with that grim muzzle. Leslie stood slowly upright, his massive head sunk into his breast. Lanigan had breathed hard and deep. It was awesome. We were held in the spell of that strange and extraordinary occurrence. On that beautiful voice went to the end. Lead has not in to temptation, but deliver us from evil, our men. A men echoed the murderers choking voice, the door to savor. It was Leslie's electric whisper, and at his signal we crashed with our united strength, with the crashing came too shots, and I caught Lanigan's harsh curse at my ear, and his swift mother too late. The door gave. She knelt with her head fallen upon her class pance, just as she had knelt in that final prayer beside the bed. He was lying back upon the pillow. There was no dry eye there. Veteran thief takers, men who had stood with their backs to the wall, and death baying them a score of times. Men who would risk the billy, or knife, or gun, has blithely as they would go to their morning meal, to whom suffering and violence and death were daily allotments, bowed themselves before the melancholy end of that misguided girl. But possibly for her, it was better so. It was Lanigan's voice that brought me back. Lanigan answered the newspaper call with a dominant newspaper demand still strong upon him and over him. Lanigan, a quick, with instinctive thought for the high-strong, chafing, sandstone down at the inquire office, and the press waiting for the release gone. Lanigan, the genius of his craft, asserting once again, his incomparable newspaper superiority to me, still dreaming the precious seconds away at the pathetic fate of that poor piece of clay kneeling there. Lanigan, crisply as a kernel in the fields, snapped, scattered nor a for a phone. And a story one.","Detective Fiction, Single Author Collections",English,06:29:27,David Wales,"['French', 'metropolis']","['Martin', 'Nory', 'Horus', 'Simpson', 'Lannigan', 'Miss Hath', 'Dan', 'Horace', 'Fogreti', 'Harry Short', 'Harry Turner', 'Lanigan', ""Bill D'Oerdee"", 'Leslie', 'Cecil Andrews', 'thou goest', 'Brady', 'Grace Turner', 'Maloney', 'Murphy', 'Hario Bryan', 'Bah', 'Harry', 'Said Leslie', 'David Wales', ""O'Brien"", 'Larry', 'Oraville Deacon', 'Edward H.

Abigail Adams and her times by Laura Elizabeth Howe Richards. Chapter 1 begins at the beginning. 1744. George II on the throne of England. Snuffield drone from the German hive. Charles Edward Stewart, Bonnie Prince Charlie, making ready for his great coup which the next year was to cast down said George from the throne and said Charles Edward there upon his rightful, lawful prince, for while-beking but Charlie. And which ended in Kaladin in the final downfall in dispersion of the Scottish stewards. In France, Louis XV, Lord of Miss Rul, shepherding his people toward the abyss with what skill was in him. At war with England, at war with Hungary, Frederick of Prussia alone standing by him. In Europe, generally, a seizing condition which is not our immediate concern. In America, seizing also, discontent, indignation, rising higher and higher under British and position. Not British either, being the work of Britain's German ruler, not of her people, yet quelled for the moment by war with France. I am not writing a history for a front. I am merely throwing on the screen in the fashion of today a few scenes to make a background from my little pen picture play. What is really our immediate concern is that on November 11th of this same year, 1744, was born to the wife of Reverend William Smith of Waymouth Massachusetts, a daughter, baptized Abigail. Parsonsmith was a notable figure of the times, not a great man, but one of character, intelligence, and cultivation. He married a daughter of Colonel John Quincy, so my heroine was a cousin. I cannot tell him what precise degree to Dorothy Q, of poetic pictorial fame. As in two, her grandmother having been an ordinary, half-boston, the cultivated and scholarly half. Parsonsmith kept a diary, as dry-adocumented as I have often read. He had no time to spare, and his brief entries were abbreviated down to the finest possible point. For example, we read that. By my good, I am asked, and I am asked, at my S, and do you as D-solve prom by thy God never to T to S, Ag? This is puzzling at first sight, but the practice reader will, after some study, make out that the good person, writing for himself alone, was really sane. By my God, I am assured, and even am assured at my strength, and do now this day, solemnly promise by thy God, never to tempt to sin again. Even this is somewhat cryptic, but we are glad of the assurance, the more that we find the poor gentleman still troubled in spirit a week later. Lord, give me S to rest the E, so pledge to me. Lord, I am ashamed of it, and resolve to S-E-T by thy S. Which, being interpreted, is, Lord grant me strength to resist the evil so prejudicial to me. Lord, I am ashamed of it, and resolve to shun evil temptation by thy strength. Whatever the temptation was, we may not know. Possibly he was inclined to extravagance in certain matters of personal dignity and adornment. We read of his pain 15 pounds for my wig, and again, at Boston, paid Mr. Oliver for a cut wig, ten pounds. But this is nothing. Parsons Smith came of Kent folk, and may have had private means beside the salary of $800. And we not read that Samuel Adams Barber Bill for three months, shaving and dressing, was 175 pounds, paid by the colony of Massachusetts. Necessary expenses were also heavy. December 4, 1749, paid brother Smith for a barrel of flour, £15.113. But on the other hand, he sold his horse to Mr. Jackson for £200. 1751 was an eventful year. On April 23, we read, Waymouth Meeting House took fire about half an hour after 10 o'clock at night, and burnt to the ground in about two hours. This is all Parsons Smith has to say about it, but the Boston Postboy of April 29 tells us that. Last Tuesday night, the old meeting house in Waymouth was burnt to the ground, and three barrels of gunpowder, the town stock, mean in the loft, blew up with a great noise, to some certain by what means the fire happened. Paltory the town poet says of it. Our powder stock kept under lock with flints and bullets were, by dismal blast soon swiftly cast into the open air. The poem hints it in sendy areas. I'm satisfied they do reside somewhere within the town. Therefore no doubt you'll find them out by searching up and down. On trial them we will condemn the sentence we will give, them execute without dispute, not being fit to live. This was a heavy blow to minister and congregation, in fact, to the whole community, for the meeting house was the center and core of the village life. The meeting house caught in matter found no just ground in scripture to apply such a trope as church to a home for public assembly. Sabbath, or more often, lords day. These are the puritan names, which happily we have not yet wholly lost. The early meeting houses were very small, that of Haverow was only 26 feet long and 20 wide. They were oftenest set on a hilltop, partly as a landmark, partly as a lookout in case of prowling Indians. The building or raising of a meeting house was a great event in the community. Every citizen was obliged by law to share in the work or the expense. Every man must give a certain amount of nails. Contributions were levied for lumber, for labor of horses and men, and for ramen cakes to regale the workers. When the medford people built their second meeting house, they provided for the workmen and bystanders five barrels of rum, one barrel of good brown sugar, a box of fine lemons, and two loaves of sugar. As a natural consequence, two thirds of the frame fell in many were injured. In north-hapton in 1738, 10 gallons of rum were bought for eight pounds to raise the meeting house. And the village doctor got three pounds for setting his bone Jonathan Strong and three pounds ten for setting Ebenezer Bert's thigh, which had somehow through the rum or the raising, both gotten broken. Finally it was realized that rum and raising did not go well together, and the workmen had to wait till night for their liquor. Once up, the meeting house became the center of village life. On the green-out sides stood the stalks, the whipping post, the pillory, the cage. Here told that the first man to occupy the Boston stocks was the carpenter who made them. His charge for the lumber being considered over high. The pillory was much frequented by Quakers and other non-orthodox persons. Here too were horse blocks and rows of stepping stones for muddy days. The conquered horse block was a fine one. It was erected by the women of the town, each housewife giving a pound of butter toward the expense. From the walls and door of the meeting house were nailed grinning heads of wolf and bear, killed partly for safety, possibly more for the reward, 15 shillings for a live wolf, 10 for a dead one. We are not told what was done with the live wolves. A man in Newbury killed seven wolves in one year, but that is nothing. We learned from the history of Roxbury that in 1725, in one week in September, 20 bears were killed within two miles of Boston. Wolves were far more dreaded than bears and saving this one remarkable instance, far more abundant. In 1723, Ips which was so beset by wolves that children could not go to meeting or to school without a grown attendant. In the early days, the meeting house was unpainted. Pain would have been thought as sinful extravagance. The 18th century, however, brought lacs or ideas, brought also cheaper paint, and the result was a sudden access of gayity. Palmfrire Connecticut painted its meeting house bright yellow. Instantly wind him nearby, voted that its meeting house be colored something like the palmfrire meeting house. Killingly in turn gave orders that the coloring of the body of our meeting house should be like the palmfrire meeting house, and the roof should be colored red. But Brooklyn carried off the palm with a combination of orange, chocolate, and white, which must have been startling even in 1762, and which would surely have sent cotton maather into convulsions that he'd been alive to see. Wolves heads outside the meeting house, inside the village powder magazine. It was the safest place because there was never any fire in the meeting house. Sometimes in the steeple, sometimes under the roof beams, there the powder closet was. If a thunderstorm came on during service, the congregation ran out and waited under the trees till it was over. Few meeting houses boasted a bell. The shrill, two to the horn, the clear blast of a conkshell, or the role of a drum, gave the signal for prayer and brought the villagers hurried from their doors and across the green to the meeting house. In East Hadley, the man who blew the conk received $3 a year for his services. The drummer was better paid, receiving 14 shillings of the town's money. The staggression on meeting houses, drawn from Mrs. Alice Morse's Earl's delightful, Sabbath in Puritan, New England, may be pardoned, if it gives some idea of the disaster so briefly recorded by Parsonsmith. Neither Parson nor parishioners were one whitt discouraged, however. On May 16th, it is true they kept a fast to be wale the burning of our meeting house. But on August 7th we read, began to raise Wameth meeting house, three days and half about it. And on September 1st, met in our new meeting house, I preached. What heroic labor? But depth and height of earnest purpose, what self-denial and sacrifice these eight brief words represent, we may well imagine, but Parsonsmith gives us no help. The thing was done, there was no more to say. About this time we begin to find ominous entries in the diary, following one another in quick and grievous succession. On the same page that records, August 15th paid £15 for my wig, we read, Mr. Benjamin Bicknell's child died of the throat distemper. Two days later, Mr. Petty's daughter died of the throat, D, aged five. Paid £4 for a hat for my son. Every day through the rest of the year they were dying, the little children, of what we may suppose was diphtheria or some kindred affection. It was a dreadful time. On November 21st we read, fast day at Mr. Bailey's parish, on account of the throat distemper prevailing there, Mr. Colton preached from two Jeremiah 30, in vain have I smitten your children, you received no correction. There had been a similar epidemic in 1735 and 36, in 12 months, 984 died of the distemper, by far the greater part under 10 years of age, the wolf fil effects of original sin remarks of pious writer of the time. All this time little Abigail Smith has been waiting patiently in her cradle. Now her turn is come. Remarkable woman as she was, perhaps the most striking fact in her life, was that she lived. Why are how any Puritan babies survived its tribulations when hardly knows? That is, any baby born in winter, and late November is winter in New England. In a few days of its birth, the baby was taken to the meeting house to be baptized. The meeting house unwarmed as we have seen from years end to years end. The wolf cold waiting to receive the poor lamb, with jaws opened wider than those grinned on the outer walls of the building. This expedition often completed the baby's earthly career. Of Judge Suil's 14 children but three survived him, a majority dying in infancy, and a 15 children of his friend caught mother but two survived their father. We are not actually told that the Christening expedition killed them, but we may infer it in many cases. The baby slept in a hooded cradle. Before going to his christening, he must be carried upstairs, with silver and gold in his hand, and scarlet laid on his head to keep him from harm. If he had fits or rickets, he was largely dosed with snail water. To make the admirable and most famous snail water, you must take a pack of garden shell snails, wash them well in small beer, and put them in an oven till they have done making a noise. Then take them out and wipe them well from the green froth that is upon them, and bruise them shells in all in a stone mortar. Then take a quarter of earthworms, scour them with salt, slit them, and... But perhaps you do not wish to make snail water, even the most admirable and famous. And after all, we have no reason to think that Abigail Smith had rickets, though she was a delicate child. She was not thought strong enough to go to school. Possibly, in any case, it might not have been thought necessary for her. The education of woman was little thought of in those days. Indeed, she herself says in one of her letters that it was fashionable to ridicule female learning. In another letter written the year before her death, she says, My early education did not partake of the abundant opportunities which the present days offer, and which even our common country schools now afford. I never was sent to any school. I was always sick. Female education in the best families went no further than writing in arithmetic, in some few and rare instances, music and dancing. Now then did Abigail get her education. Easily enough, school was not necessary for her. She loved books, and there were plenty of them, not only in Parsonsmith's study, but in the home of her grandfather, Colonel John Quincy, then living at Mount Williston, not far from Wemeth. A great part of her childhood was spent with her grandparents, and to her grandmother Quincy in particular, she always felt that she owed a great deal. I have not forgotten, she writes to her own daughter in 1795, the excellent lessons which I received from my grandmother, at a very early period of life. I frequently think they made a more durable impression upon my mind than those which I received from my own parents. Whether it was owing to the happy method of mixing instruction and amusement together, or from an inflexible adherence to certain principles, the utility of which I could not but see and approve when a child, I know not, but mature years have rendered them oracles of wisdom to me. I love and revere her memory. Her lively cheerful disposition animated all around her, while she edified all by her unaffected piety. This tribute is due to the memory of those virtues, the sweet remembrance of which will flourish, though she is long slept with her ancestors. We can fancy the child sitting by the delightful grandmother, in bibin instruction and amusement, working the while at her sampler, or setting delicate stitches in a shirt for her father or grandfather. Girls do not make the family shirts nowadays, but I know one dear lady who, at seven years old, was set down at her grandmother's side to cut and make a shirt for her grandfather, taking every stitch herself. We can see Abigail too, browsing among Colonel Quincy's bookshelves, reading Shakespeare and Dryden and Pope and prior, the spectator too, and all the history she could lay her hands on, and perhaps the novels of Mr. Richardson, Mr. Fielding, Mr. Smallett, three young men who were making a great stir in those days. She wrote letters too, in the fashion of the time, endless letters to girlfriends and wameth or Boston, high-falutin and language, but full of good sense and good feeling. We elders are always sign, give us, ah, give us, but yesterday, and I cannot help deploring the decay of letter writing. Since Charles Francis Adams, in the admirable memoir, with which he prefaces his collections of the letters of John and Abigail Adams, perhaps there is no species of exercise in early life, more productive of results useful to the mind than that of writing letters. Over and above the mechanical facility of constructing sentences, which no teaching will afford so well, the interest with which the object is commonly pursued gives an extraordinary impulse to the intellect. This has promoted in a degree proportionate to the scarcity of temporary and local subjects for discussion. Whether as little gossip, the want of it must be supplied from books. The love of literature springs up where the weeds of scandal take no root. The young ladies of Massachusetts, in the last century, were certainly readers, even though only self-taught, and their taste was not for the feeble and nervous sentiment or the frantic passion, which comes from the novels and romances in the circulating library of our day, but was derived from the deepest wells of English literature. The poets and moralists of the mother country furnished to these inquiring minds their apple stores, and they were used to an extent which is at least doubtful if the more pretending in a elaborate instruction of the present generation would equal. However this may be, and I believe every word of it myself, we must all be thankful that Abby Smith formed the letter writing habit early in life. If she had not, we might have lacked one of the most vivid pictures of life in revolutionary times. Her girlhood letters, those at least to her girl friends, were signed Diana, and were addressed to Maira, Aspasia, Kalyapi, O'Relia. Later, in writing to her faithful friend, lover and husband, Porcia was the name she chose, a name that suited her well. Here is a letter written in her girlhood to her friend Mrs. Lincoln. Famous, five October, 1761. My dear friend. Does not my friend think me a stupid girl when she is kindly offered to correspond with me that I should be so senseless as to not accept the offer? Sentseless and stupid I would confess myself, and that to the greatest degree, if I did not foresee the many advantages I shall receive from corresponding with a lady of your known prudence and understanding. I gratefully accept your offer, although I may be charged with vanity and pretending to entertain you with my scrolls. Yet I know your generosity is such that, like a kind parent, you will bury in oblivion all my imperfections. I do not aim at entertaining. I write merely for the instruction and edification which I shall receive, provided you honor me with your correspondence. You bid me tell one of my sparks. I think that was the word to bring me to see you. Why? I believe you think there is plenty of hairings. When a last, there is as great a scarcity of them as there is of justice, honesty, prudence and many other virtues. I have no pretensions to one. Well, wealth is the only thing that has looked after now. To said Plato thought, if virtue would appear to the world, all mankind would be enamored with her, but now interest governs the world, and men neglect the golden mean. But to be sober, I should really rejoice to come and see you, but if I wait till I get a, what did you call him? I fear you'll be blind with age. I can say in the length of this epistle, I've made the golden rule mine. Pray my friend, do not let it be long before you write to your ever-efectionate, A.S. Don't feel sure that Abigail was a good child, as well as a bright one. She was not an infant prodigy, what is glad to think. Parents and grandparents were too sensible to play tricks with her mind or her soul. When size to read of the Pius and ingenious Jane Turrell, a Puritan child who could relate many stories out of the scriptures before she was two years old. Before she was four years old, she could say the greater part of the assemblies' catacysm, many of the Psalms, read distinctly, and make pertinent remarks on many things she read. She asked many astonishing questions about divine mysteries. It is comforting to know that Jane liked green apples. Her father, at the end of a Pius letter, jurors her, as she loves him not to eat them, but it shows that after all she was a human child. We do not know much about the diet of Puritan children. Carson Smith was a good farmer, killed his own pork and beef, planted apple trees, made cider, etc. We may suppose that Abigail had plenty of good fish and flesh with a salad now and then, and corn, squash, and pumpkins at her desire. Pumpians, the latter were often called, while squash were variously known as squandersquash, as kuda squash, is quoker squash, all Indian variants of the one name which we clip into a monocillamol. We did not grow well in the colonies. Oton and Rhymeel was chiefly used in combination with the universal corn. They had haystie pudding, boiled in a bag or fried, suck a hash, and Johnny cake, or journey cake, which we have changed by the insertion of an age to let appears as if Johnny had either invented or owned it. Parts corn are popcorn, a favorite food of the Indians, was also highly appreciated by the colonists. They were amazed at first sight of it. Governor Winthrop explains carefully how, on being parched, the corn turns entirely inside out and is white and flowery within. Sometimes they made it into no cake, which is we are told Indian corn, parched in the hot ashes, the ashes being sifted from it, it is afterwards beaten to powder and put into a long, leathered bag, trust like an apsec, out of which they take thrice three spoonfuls a day. This was considered wonderfully sustaining food. It was mixed before eating with snow and winter, with water and summer. The pumpkins were made into pies, cakes, bread, sauce. We have pumpkins at morning and pumpkins at noon, if it were not for pumpkins we should be undone. Potatoes were brought over from England as early as 1636, but were not grown till some time later. People were still afraid of them. Some thought that if a man eats them every day he could not live beyond seven years. Some again fancy the balls were the edible portion and did not much desire them. Nor were the recipes for cooking them especially inviting. The accomplished cook, much in use about the year 1700, says that potatoes must be boiled and blanched, seasoned with nutmeg and cinnamon and pepper, mixed with eringo roots, made slamming and whole mace, covered with butter, sugar and grapever juice made with pastry, then iced with rose water and sugar and he clipped a secret pie. Let us hope that Mrs. Smith, a Quincy born, knew better than to torture an overwhelmed a worthy vegetable. We know a little of this good lady, but we may suppose that she was a notable housewife, since her daughter in later life showed such skill in all household arts. We shall see by and by how Abigail baked and brewed, spun and wove, clothed and fed and cared for her family, often with little or no assistance. We may fancy her now, trotting about after Mother Smith at Waymouth or grandmother Quincy at Williston, her bright eyes noting everything. Her quick fingers mastering all the arts of preserving, candy and distilling. There was a passion for such work among the New England women in those days. They made preserves and conserves, marmalettes and quid knees, hypocrisy and household wines, uskabarbs and corjoles. They candied fruits and made cerebs. They preserved everything that would bear preserving. I have seen all time recipes for preserving Quincy's, rest-pass, pippons, apricots, plums, damsels, peaches, oranges, lemons, artichokes, green walnuts, elicampane roots, aringol roots, grapes, barberies, cherries, recipes for syrup of clove, guillaflower, wormwood, mint, aniseed, clove, elder, lemons, marigold, citron, hisoplicarish. The recipe is for conserves of roses, violets, borge flowers, rosemary, betnese, sage, mint, lavender, marjoram, and teoni. Rules for candy and fruit, berries and flowers for poppy water, cordial, cherry water, lemon water, thyme water and jellica water, aqua mirabalice, aquacilestice, clary water, mint water. Good living was cheap and Abigail's childhood. In English traveler visiting Boston in 1740 writes thus. Their poultry of all sorts are as fine as can be desired, and they have plenty of fine fish of various kinds, all of which are very cheap. Take the butcher's meat all together, in every season of the year, I believe it is about two pens per pound sterling. The best beef and mutton, lamb and veal, are often sold for six pens per pound of New England money, which is some small matter more than one penny sterling. Pultry in their season are exceeding cheap. As good a turkey is maybe bought for about two shillings sterling, as we can buy in London for six or seven, and as fine a goose for ten pens, as would cost three shillings and six pens are four shillings in London. The cheapest of all the several kinds of poultry are sort of wild pigeon, which are in season the latter end of June, and so continue until September. They are large, and finer than those we have in London, and are sold here for 18 pens a dozen, and sometimes for half of that. Fish too is exceedingly cheap. They sell a fine fresh caud that will weigh a dozen pounds or more, just taken out of the sea for about two pens sterling. They have smells too, which they sell as cheapest sprat's are in London. They come in too they have in great plenty, and these they sell for about a shilling a piece, which will weigh 14 or 15 pounds. Shad, strange to say, was profoundly despised. In Puritan times they were fed to the hogs. In 1733 they sold two for a penny, and it was not at all the thing to eat them, or at least to be seen eating them. A story is told of a family and hadley Massachusetts who were about to die on a shad, and who, hearing a knock at the door, delayed opening it till Shad and platter had been hustled out of sight. They have venison very plenty. They will sell as fine a haunch for half a crown, as would cost full 30 shillings in England. Brad is much cheaper than we have in England, but is not near so good. But it is very fine, and cheaper than ever I bought any in London. The best is sold all summer for three pens a pound. But as for cheese, it is neither cheap nor good. And milk was one penny a court. But we shall see great changes before we finish our story. These were the years of plenty of the fat kind and the full ears of corn.

Some Britons believe this tight little island holds a record that even America will not dispute. That of possessing the laziest man in the world. In the person of one chill-cut. Who the other day slept peacefully in the dock of London's suburban criminal court, while the presiding justice considered what he should do with him. After being loudly asked several times if he had anything to say, he opened one eye reproachfully at the recorder. Yon, sighed, no, and relapsed into slumber. On one occasion, Chil-cut was heard to say that he had never done a voluntary hours work in his life. This oradical effort so fatigued him, he did not utter a word for the rest of the day. His conversation usually consists of reluctant yeses and noes, and he is the despair of nearly every workhouse master in the country. He was examined by Dr. Wilson, who diagnosed the disease which had attacked him as Ergophobia, Theor of Work. Chil-cut, for three months past, has been under-remend at the one's worth jail, where the officials have had great difficulty in inducing him even to move. He is a big, heavy man. The prosecuting council said the prisoner was so lazy that he would not take the trouble to walk and had to be pushed about. Even had to be pushed into the dock. Chil-cut was awakened to hear the recorder sentence him, but as the magistrate began to read him a lecture, he dropped off to sleep before he heard that he had been condemned to 12 months in prison with hard labor.

The Three Musketeers by Alexander Dumas translated by William Hubsen. Authors Preface. In which it is proved that, notwithstanding their names ending in OS and IS, the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to relate to our readers, have nothing mythological about them. A short time ago, while making researchers in the Royal Library for my history of Louis XIV, I stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of Monsieur D'Autagne. Printed, as were most of the works of that period, in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a resonance more or less long in the best deal. At Amsterdam, by Pierre-Cruge. The title attracted me. I took them home with me with the permission of the Guardian and devoured them. It is not by intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious work, and I shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages. They will therein find portrait's pencil by the hand of a master. And although these squibs may be for the most part, trace upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabaret's, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII and of Austria, Rishilu, Mazera, and the courtiers of the period, less faithful than in the history of Monsieur Ankati. But, it is well known what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers. Now, while admiring, as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate, our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought. Dartagnan relates that on his first visit to Monsieur de Chaville, captain of the King's Muscatiers, he met in the Ande Chamber three young men, serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received, bearing the names of Athos, Portos, and Eremus. We must confess that these three strange names struck us, and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, under which Dartagnan had disguised names, perhaps illustrious, or else the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which, from Caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had done the simple Muscatiers uniform. From that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace and contemporary works of these extraordinary names, which had so strongly awakened our curiosity. The catalog alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter, which although it might be very instructive, would certainly afford our readers but little amusement. It will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which, discouraged by so many fruitless investigations, we were about to abandon our search, we at Lingfound guided by the counts as of our illustrious friend Paul La Parille, a manuscript in Folio endorsed 4772 or 4773, we did not recollect which. Having for title, memoirs of the Compt Dilephare, touching some of theence which passed in France towards the end of the reign of King Louis XIII and the commencement of the reign of King Louis XIV. It may be easily imagined how great was our joy when, in turning over this manuscript, our last hope, we found at the 20th page the name of Athos. At the 27th, the name of Porthos, at the 31st, the name of Aramas. The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical sciences carry to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous. We hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it, with a view of presenting ourselves some day with the pack of others at the doors of the Academy, Days and Scripsion, a bell-lethal. If we should not succeed, a very probable thing by the by, and gaining ambition to the Academy front says with our own proper pack. This permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted, which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters. Now, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and entering into an engagement that if, of which we have no doubt, this first part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the second immediately. In the meanwhile, as the Godfather is a second father, we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comptil affair, the pleasure or the unwee he may experience. This being understood, let us proceed with our history, and of author's preface.",Action & Adventure Fiction,English,26:40:10,Mark F.

The Young Diana,Marie Corelli,260972,6.0,"February 18, 2018","['\n        I enjoyed the first part of the book, where the middle-aged, unmarried, unloved Diana finally broke her chains and set herself free.\n\nBut then it got weird. I\'m not overly familiar with Corelli\'s works, so this might just be her style. It was an age where science could answer and solve every question, so science answering the question of aging isn\'t a surprise. But the person into whom Diana changed was unsettling for me. And the constant harping in the book about how there is no such thing as ""love"" and that ""love"" is just animal attraction got very tiresome.\n\nThe reader was good, but her style got a bit heavy-handed after a while. It probably wouldn\'t have bothered me if I hadn\'t binge-listened but spread it out over a longer period. :)      ']",1,".org. The Young Diana by Marie Carelli. Chapter 1 Once upon a time, in earlier and less congested days of literary effort, an author was accustomed to address the public as, gentle reader. It was a civil phrase involving a pretty piece of flattery. It implied three things. First, that if the reader were not, gentle, the authors could see might persuade him or heard become so. Secondly, that criticism, whether favorable or the reverse, might perhaps be generously postponed till the reading of the book was finished. And, thirdly, that the author had no wish to irritate the reader's feelings, but rather sought to prepare and smooth the way to a friendly understanding. Now, I am at one with my predecessors in all these delicate points of understanding, and, as I am about to relate what every person of merely average intelligence is likely to regard as an incredible narrative, I think it as well to begin politely. In the old-fashioned, grand manner of appeal, which is half apologetic and half conciliatory. Gentle reader, therefore, I pray you to be friends with me. Do not lose either patience or temper while following the strange adventures of a very strange woman, though in case you should be disappointed in seeking for what you will not find, let me say at once that my story is not of the sex problem type. No. My heroine is not perverted from the piles of decency and order, or drawn to a bad end. In fact, I cannot bring her to an end at all, as she is still very much alive, and doing uncommonly wealth for herself. Any end for Diana May would seem not only incongruous, but manifestly impossible. Life, as we all know, is a curious business. It is like a stage mask with two faces. The one comic, the other tragic. The way we look at it depends on the way it looks at us. Some of us have seen it on both sides, and are neither edified nor impressed. Then, again, life is a series of sensations. We who live now are always describing life. They who lived long ago did the same. It seems that none of us have ever found, or can never find, anything better to occupy ourselves with all. All through the ages, the millions of human creatures who once were born and who are now dead, passed their time on this planet in experiencing sensations, and relating their experiences to one another, each telling his or her little tale of woe in a different way. So anxious were they, and so anxious are we, to explain the special and individual manner in which our mental and physical vibrations respond to the particular circumstances in which we find ourselves, that all systems of religion, government, science, are turned for loss of we have been, and are, evolved simply and solely out of the pains and pleasures of a mass of atoms who are, feeling things, and trying to express their feelings to each other. These feelings they designate by various lofty names, such as faith, logic, reason, opinion, wisdom, and so forth, and upon them they build temporary fabrics of law and order. Fastly solid in appearance, yet collapsible as a house of cards, and crumbling at a touch, while every now and again there comes a sudden, unlipped for interruption to their discussions and plans, a kind of dark paul and suggestion of chaos, such as a great war, a plague or other unwelcome visitation of God, wherein, feelings, almost cease, or else people are too frightened to talk about them. They are children to nervous silence and wait, afflicted by fear and discouragement, till the cloud passes in the air clears. Then the perpetual buzz of, feeling, begins again in the mixed base and trouble of complaint and rejoicing, a kind of monotonous noise without harmony. External nature has no part in it, from man as the only creature that ever tries to explain the phenomena of existence. It is not in the least comprehensible why he alone should thus trouble and putplex himself, or why his insuscant consideration and analysis of his own emotions should be allowed to go on. For, whatsoever education may do for us, we shall never be educated out of the sense of our own importance, which is an odd fact, moving many thoughtful minds to never ending wonder. My heroine, Diana May, wondered. She was always wondering, she spent weeks and months and years in a chronic state of wonder. She wondered about herself and several other people because she thought both herself and those several other people so absurd. She found no use for herself in the general scheme of things and tried, with much patient humility to account for herself. But, though she read books on science, books on psychology, books on natural and spiritual law, and studied complex problems of evolution in selection of species to her poor, dim eyes grew dimmer, and the lines from nose to chin became ever longer and deeper. She could discover no way through the thick barg of her difficulties. She was an awkward numeral in a sum. She did not know why she came in or how she was to be got out. Her father and mother were what are called very well-to-do people, with a pleasantly suburban reputation for respectability and regular church attendance. Mr. James Pollardor May, this was his name in full as engraved on his visiting card, was a small man in structure, but in self-complacency the biggest one alive. He had made a considerable fortune in a certain manufacturing business which need not here be specified, and he had speculated with it in a shrewd and careful manner, which was not without a touch of genius. The happy result being that he had always gained and never lost. Now at the age of 60, he was free from all financial care and could rattle gold and silver in his trousers pockets with a sense of pleasure in their clinking sound. They had the sweetness of church bells which proclaim the shurniness of a prosperous town. He was not a bad looking little veteran. He had, as he was fond of saying of himself, a good chest measurement, and though his legs were short, they were not bandy. Inclined to corpillants, the two lower buttons of his waistcoat were generally left undone, that he might the more easily stretch himself after a four meal. His physionyme was not so much intelligent as pugnacious. His bushy eyebrows, hair and moustache gave him at certain moments the look of an erasable old terrier. He had keen small eyes, coming close to the bridge of a rather pronounced Israel-litish nose, and to these characteristics was added a generally assertive air, an air which went before him like an advancing atmosphere, hurleding his approach as a somebody. That sort of atmosphere which invariably accompanies, nobodies. His admiration of the first sex was open and not always discrete, and from his youth up he had believed himself capable of subjugating any and every woman. He had an agreeable first manner of his own on introduction, a manner which was absolutely deceptive, giving no clue to the uglier side of his nature. His wife could have told all stories about this, first manner of his, had she not long ago given up the attempt to retain any hold on her own individuality. She had been a woman of average intelligence when she married him. Common place, certainly, but good natured and willing to make the best of everything. Needless to say that the illusions of youth vanished with the first years of wedded life, as they are apt to do, and she had gradually sunk into a flabby condition of resigned non-intert, seeing there was nothing else left for her. Bedoule claimed tenor of her days had once been interrupted by the birth of her only child, Diana, who as long as she was small and young, and while she was being educated under the usual system of governanceism and schools, was an object of delight, affection, amusement and interest, and who, when she grew up and came out, at 18 as a graceful, pretty girl of the precious type of English beauty, gave her mother something to love and to live for, but a last, Diana had proved the bitterist of all her disappointments. The, coming out business, the balls, the race meetings, and other maximonyal traps had been set in vain. The training, the music, the dancing, the toilet, had failed to attract, and Diana had not married. She had fallen in love, as most girls do before they know much about men, and she had engaged herself to an officer with, expectations. For whom, with her romantic devotion as out of date as the poems of Chaucer, she had waited for seven long years in a resigned condition of alarming constancy. And then, when his expectations were re-advised, he had promptly thrown her over for a fairer and younger partner. By that time, Diana was what is called, getting on. All this had tried the temper of Mrs. James Polydor May considerably, and she took refuge from her many of exations in the pleasures of the table and the constellations of sleep. The result of this mode of procedure was actually became corpulent and unwieldy. Her original self was swallowed up in a sort of featherbed of adipose tissue, from which she peered out on the world with protruding lustiless eyes. The tip of her small nose seeming to protest feebly against the injustice of being well-nive world from sight between the massive flabby cheeks on either side of its never-classic and distinctly parsimonious proportions. With over-sleep and overeating she had matured into a stupid and somewhat obstinate woman, with a habit of saying unmeaningly nice or nasty things. She would gush affectionately too old and sundry, to the maid who fuss into shoes as ardently as to a friend of many years standing. Yet she would mock her own guests behind their backs, or unkindly criticise the physical and mental defects of the very man or woman she had flattered obsequiously five minutes before, so that she was not exactly a safe acquaintance. You never knew where to have her. But, as is often the case with these placidly smiling obese ladies, everyone seemed to be in a conspiracy to call her, sweet, and dear, and kind. Whereas in truth she was one of the most selfish souls extent. Her charities were always carefully considered and bestowed in quarters where she was likely to get most credit for them, her profusely expressed sympathy for other people's troubles exhausted itself in a few moments, and she would straight away forget what form of loss on this fortune she had just been commiserating. While, despite her proverbial, dear, and, sweet, attributes, she had a sulky temper which would hold her in its grip for days, during which time she would neither speak nor be spoken to. A chief interest and attention were sent to it on eatables, and she always made a point of going to breakfast in advance of her husband, so that she might select for herself, the most succulent morsels out of the regulation dish of fried bacon, before he had a chance to look in. Huzbund and wife were always arguing with each other, and both were always wrong in each other's opinion. Mrs. James Polledore may considered her worst or half as something of a wayward and pivish child, and he in turn looked upon her as a useful domestic female. Perfectly simple and natural, he was want to say, a statement which, if true, would have been vastly convenient to her, but he could then have deceived her more easily. But, deeper than ever plummet sounded, was the simplicity, where we of Mrs. James Polledore may was endowed, and the natural way in which she managed to secure her own comfort, convenience and ease, while assuming to be the most guileless and unsolvable woman. Indeed, there were times when she was fairly astonished at herself for having a ranged thing so cleverly as she expressed it. Whenever a woman of her type admits to having a ranged thing's cleverly, you may be sure that the most astute lawyer alive could never surpass her in the high to the depth of duplicity. Such, briefly outlined with a characteristics of the couple who, in an absent-minded moment, had taken upon themselves the responsibility of bringing a woman into the world for whom, apparently the world had no use. Woman, considered in the rough abstract, is only the pack-mule of man. His goods, his chattels, created specially to be the vessel of his passion and humor, and without his favor and support she is by universal consent set down as a lonely and wandering mistake. Such is the law and the profits. Under these circumstances, which have recently shown signs of yielding to pressure, Diana, the rapidly aging spintestodotter of Mr and Mrs James Pollard or May, was impityable plight. No man wanted her, not even to serve him as a pack-mule. No man sought to add her person to his goods and chattels, and at the time this true story opens, she was not fair or fascinating or young enough to serve him as a toy for his delight, a plating of his pleasure. Life had been very monotonous for her since she had passed the turning point of 30 years. Nice people who always say nasty things, remarked, help us say she was getting. Thereby helping the aging process considerably. She, meanwhile, bore her lot with exemplary cheerfulness. She neither grizzled nor complained, nor showed herself envious of you for youthful loveliness. A comforting idea of, beauty, took possession of her mind, and she devoted herself to the tenderest care of her fat mother in irritable father, waiting upon them like a slave, and saying her prayers for them night and morning as simply as a child, without the faintest suspicion that they were passed praying for. The years went on, and she took pains to educate herself and all that might be useful. She read much and thought more. She mastered two or three languages, and spoke them with ease and fluency, and she was an admirable musician. She had an abundance of pretty light brown hair, and all her movements were graceful, but alas, the unmistakable look of growing old was stamped upon her once mobile features. She had become angular and flat-chested, and the unbecoming straight line from waste to knee, which gave her figure a kind of pitiful masculinity, was developing with hard and bony relentlessness. One time she had, which she herself recognized and took care to cultivate, a low, sweet voice, and excellent thing in woman. If one chanced to hear her speaking in an adjoining room, the effect was remarkable, one felt that some exquisite creature of immortal youth and tenderness was expressing a heavenly thought in music. Mr. James Pollard or May, as I have already ventured to suggest, was nothing if not respectable. He was a JP. This, in English suburban places at least, is the hallmark of an unimpeachable rectitude. Another sign of his good standing in general uprightness was, let it stated seasons he always went for a change of air. We all know that the person who remains in one place the whole year round is beyond the pale and cannot be received in the best society. Mr. May had a handsome house and grounds in the close vicinity of Richmond, with an easy distance of town, but when the London season ended. He and Mrs. May invariably discovered their home to be. Stuffy, and side for more expansive breathing and pure oxygen than Richmond could supply. They had frequently taken a shooting or fishing in Scotland, but that was in the days when there were still muchmonial hopes for Diana, and when marriageable men could be invited, not only to handle rod and gun, but to inspect their one-year-lamp, which they were over anxious to sell to the highest bidder. These happy dreams were at an end. It was no longer worthwhile to lay an extensive supplies of whiskey and cigars by way of impetus to timid or hesitating benedics when they came back from a day on the moars, tired, sleepy, and stupid enough to drift into proposals of marriage almost unconsciously. Mr. May seldom invited young men to stay with him now, for the very reason that he could not get them. They found him a, bore, his wife, doll, and his daughter, and old maid, a term of depreciation still freely used by the golden youth of the day, despite the modern and more civil term of Lady Bachelor. So he drew in the horns of his past ambition, and consoled himself with the society of two or three partly men of his own age and habits, men who played golf and billyards, and who, if they could do nothing else, smoked continuously. And for the necessary change of air, this side offered itself as a means of health without too excessive and expenditure, and instead of chasing the wild deer and following the row, a simple hammock chair on the sandy beach, and a golf course within easy walking distance provided sufficient relaxation. Not that Mr. May was in any sense past some onus, he did not take a cottage by the sea or cheap lodgings. On the contrary, he was always prepared to do the thing hand-simly, and to select what the house agents call in, ideal residents. At the particular time I am writing of, he had just settled down for the summer in a very special, ideal, on the coast of Devon. It was a house which had formerly belonged to an artist, but the artist had recently died, and his handsome and not-in-consolable widow stated that she found it dull. She was glad to let it for two or three months, in order to, get away, without restless silacrity which distinguishes so many people who find anything better than their own homes, and Mr. and Mrs. Pollardor May, though, as they said, it certainly was a little quiet after London, we're glad to have it, at quite a moderate rental for the charming place it really was. The gardens were exquisitely laid out and carefully kept. The smooth velvety lawns ran down almost to the sea, where a little white gate opened out from the green of the grass to the gold of the sand. The rooms were tastefully furnished, and Diana, when she first saw the place, going some days in advance of her father and mother, as was her want, in order to make things ready and comfortable for them. For how happy she could be if only such a house and garden were hers to enjoy, independently of others. For a week before her respected and respectable parents came, in the intervals of unpacking, and arranging matters so that the domestic, staff, could assume their ordinary duties with smoothness and regularity. She wandered about alone, exploring the beauties of her surroundings. Her thin, flat figure striking a curious note of sadness and solitude, as she sometimes stood in the garden among a wealth of flowers, looking out to the tender dove-grey line of the horizon across the sea. The servants peeping out of from kitchen and pantry windows made their own comments. Poor dear, said the cook, thoughtfully, she do wear thin. It's a sad look out for. Side the upper house made, who was engaged to a pork butcher with an alarmingly red face, and one would have fought any self-respecting young woman would have died rather than wedded. To be all alone in the world like that, unprotected, as she will be when her pawn Margorn. While they will go in her earry, put in the butt, though, who was an observing man. Least ways. Mr May, won't. Earled onto life like a gap to a mouse. He will. He's that arty. Why? He thinks he's about 30 instead of 60. The Mrs now, if she goes on eating as she do, she'll drop off sudden like a bursting bean, but he, ah, I shouldn't wonder if he outlasted us all. Law Mr Johnson. Exclaim the upper house made. How you do talk, and you such a young man, too. Johnson smiled inwardly flattered. He was well over 40, but like his master wish to be considered a kind of youth. But for dancing, tennis, and other such games and occupations. Mr Anna. He now continued, with a judicious affair. As lost her chances, it's a pity for no one won't marry her now. There's too many young girls about it, no man wants the old ones. She allowed to take up her mission or something to get noticed at all. Here, a quiet-looking woman named Grace Lorean to post. She was the ladies' maid, and she was held in great respect, for she was engaged to marry, at some uncertain and distant date, on Australian farmer with considerable means. Ms Diana is very clever. She said. She could do almost anything she cared, too. She's got a great deal more in her than people think, and here Grace has a tated. She's puttyly made, too, though she's over thin, when she comes from her bath with all her hair hanging down. She looks sweet. The Google of Hulf hesitating, Hulf incredulous laughter greeted this remark. Well, it's few ladies as looks sweet coming from above, the clear the butlo with emphasis. I've had many a peep at the misses. Here the laughter broke out loudly with little cries of, oh, oh, and the kitchen chatter ended. It had come to the last day of Diana's free and uncontrolled enjoyment of the charming seaside Eden which a parents had selected as a summer retreat, and regretfully realising this. She strolled lingeringly about the garden, inhaling the sweet odours of roses in minionette with a salty breath of the sea. The next morning, Mr. and Mrs. Polidame, would arrive in time for luncheon, and once more the old domestic job truck would commence. The same routine is that which prevailed at Richmond, with no other change save such as was conveyed in the differing scene and surroundings. Breakfast punctually at nine, luncheon at one, T at 430, dinner at a quarter to eight. Dinner at a quarter to eight was one of Diana's bug bears. Why not have it at eight a clock she thought? The quarter two was an irritating juggling with time for which there was no necessity. But she had protested in vain. Dinner at quarter to eight was one of her mother's many domestic fads. Between the several meals inumerated there would be nothing doing. Nothing that is to say of any consequence or use to anybody. Diana knew the whole weary stupid round. Mr. May would pass the morning reading the papers either in the garden or on the sandy shore. Mrs. May would give a few muddled and contradictory orders to the servants, who never obeyed them literally, but only as far as they could be conveniently carried out. And then would retire to write letters to friends or acquaintances. In the afternoon, Mr. May would devote himself to golf while his wife slept till tea time. Then she would take a stroll in the garden and perhaps only perhaps. Talk over a few household affairs with her daughter. Then came the quarter to eight dinner with doesaltry and somewhat wrangling conversation after which Mrs. May slept again and Mr. May played billiards if he could find anyone to play with him. If not, he practiced tricky things alone with the queue. Neither of them ever thought that this sort of life was not conducive to cheerfulness so far as their daughter Diana was concerned. Indeed, they never considered her at all. When she was young, ah yes, of course. It was necessary to find such entertainment and society for her as might show her off. But now, when she was no longer marriageable in the conventionally accepted sense of marriage, she was left to bear the brunt of fate as best she might, and learned to be contented with the plain, feminine duty of keeping house for her parents. It must be stated that she did this keeping house business to perfection. She controlled expenses without a taint of meanness, managed the servants, and made the whole common place a fair of ordinary living run smoothly. But whatever she did, she never had a word of praise from either her father or mother. They took her careful services their right, and never seemed to realise that most of their comforts and conveniences were the result of her forethought and good sense. Certainly they did not trouble themselves as to whether she was happy or the reverse. She thought of this, just a little but not merosely. On the last evening she was to spend alone at Rose Lee, as the ideal summer residence was called, probably on account of its facing west, and gathering on its walls and windows all the brilliant flush of the sunset. She was somewhat weary. She had been occupied for hours in arranging her mother's bedroom, and seeing that all the numerous luxuries needed by that pl acid mass of superfluous flesh were in their place and order. And now that she had finished everything she had to do, she was glad to have the remainder of her time to herself, in the garden, thinking and, as usual, wondering. Her window is just simply this. How long would she have to go on in the same clockwork mechanism of life as that which now seemed to be her destiny? She had made certain variations in the slow music of her days by study. Yes, that was true. But then no one made use of her studies, no one knew the extent of her attainments, and even in her music she had no encouragement, no one of her arse to a play. All her efforts seemed so much wasted output of energy. She had certain private joys of her own, a great love of nature, which, like an open door in heaven, allowed her to enter familiarly into some of the marbles and benedictions of creative intelligence. She loved books, and could read them in French and Italian, as well as in her native English. And she had taken to the study of Russian with some success. Greek and Latin she had learned sufficiently well to understand the great offers of the elder world in their own script. But all these intellectual diversions were organised and followed on her own initiative, and as she sometimes said to herself a trifle bitterly, nobody knows I can do anything but check the tradesman's books and order the dinner. This was a fact, nobody knew. Ordnary people considered her unattractive, what they saw was a scrappy woman of medium height with a worn face visibly beginning to wrinkle under a profusion of brown hair, a woman who had been pretty when younger, but who now had a rather restrained and nervous manner, and who was seldom inclined to speak. Yet, who, when spoken to, answered always gently, in a sweet voice with a wonderfully musical accentuation. No one thought for a moment that she might possibly be something of a scholar, and certainly no one imagined that above all things, she was a great student of all matters pertaining to science. Every book she could hear of on scientific subjects, whether treating of wireless telegraphy, light rays, radium, or other marvellous discoveries of the age, she made it a special business to secure and to study patiently and comprehendingly. The result being that her mind was richly stored with material for thought on far higher planes than the majority of reading folk ever attempted to reach. But she never spoke of the things in which she was so deeply interested, and as she was reserved and almost awkwardly shy and company. The occasional collars on her mother scarcely noticed her, except casually and with a careless civility which meant nothing. She was seen to knit and to do Jacqueby and tapestry rather well, and people spoke to her of these accomplishments as being what they thought she was most likely to understand. But they looked as cancer to dress, which was always a little tasteless and unbecoming, and applying to that poor, dear Mrs. May must be dreadfully disappointed in her daughter. It never occurred to these easy-tongued folk that Diana was dreadfully disappointed in herself. This was the trouble of it. She asked the question daily and could find no answer. And yet, she was useful to her parents, surely. Yes. But in her own heart she knew they would have been just a satisfied with a paid, companion housekeeper. They did not really love her. Now that she had turned out such a failure, a last poor Diana, her hunger for love was her misfortune. It was the one thing in all the world she craved. It had been this desire of love that had charmed her impulse of soul when in the heyday of her youth and prittiness. She had engaged herself to the man for whom she had waited seven years, only to be heartlessly thrown over at last. She had returned all his letters in exchange for her own at the end of the affair. All, safe too. And these two, she read every night before she said her prayers to keep them well fixed in her memory. One of them contained the following passage. How I love you my own sweet little Diana, you are to me the most adorable girl in the world, and if I ever do an unkind thing to you or wrong you in any way, may God punish me for a treacherous brute, my one desire in life is to make you happy. The other letter written some years later, was rather differently expressed. I am quite sure you will understand that time has naturally worked changes in you as well as in myself, and I am obliged to confess that the feelings I once had for you no longer exist, but you are a sensible woman, and you are all enough now to realise that we are better apart. You are old enough now, was the phrase that jarred upon Diana's inward sense, like the ugly sound of a clanking chain in a convict cell, you are old enough now. Well, it was true. She was old enough, but she had taken this, oldness, upon her while faithfully waiting for her lover, and he had been the first to punish her for her constancy. It was very strange. Indeed it was one of those many things that had brought her to her chronic state of Wondermond. The great writers, more notably great poets themselves the most fickle of man, utilised fidelity in love as a heavenly virtue. Why then, when she had practiced it, had she been so sorely rewarded? Yet, since the rupture of her engagement, and the long and bitter pain she had endured over this breaking up of all she had held most dear, her many studies and her careful reading had gradually calmed and strengthened her nature, and she was able to admit to herself that there were possibly worse things than the loss of a heartless lover who might have proved a still more heartless husband. She felt no resentment towards him, and his memory now scarcely moved her to a thrill of sorrow or regret. She only asked herself why it had all happened. Of course there was no answer to such a query, there never is. And she was old enough. Yes, quite old enough, to put away all romance and sentimentality. Yet as she walked slowly in the garden among the roses and watched the sea sparkling in the warm afterglow of what had been an exceptionally fine sun setting, the old foolish craving stirred in her heart again. The scent of the flowers, the delicate breathings of the summer air, the flash of the sea ghouls white wings skimming over the glittering sand pools. All these expressions of natural beauty saddened while they entranced her soul. She longed to be one with them, sharing their life and imparting to others something of their joy. They never grow old, she said, awful loud. Or if they do, it is not perceived. They seem always the same, always beautiful and vital. Here she paused. A standard rose tree weighted with splendid blossom showed among its flowers, one that had been cramped and spoiled by the over-prefusion and close pressure of its companions. It was decaying amid the ego crowd of bursting buds that looked almost humanly anxious to be relieved of its presence. With soft, deaf fingers Diana broke it away from the stem and let it drop to earth. That is me, she said, and that's what ought to become of me, nothing withered or ugly ought to live in such a lovely world. I am a blot on beauty. She looked out to see again. The afterglow had almost faded, only one broad line of dull gold showed the parting trail of the sun. No, there's no hope. She murmured, with an expressive gesture of her hands. I must plot on day after day in the same old rut of things, doing my duty, which is perhaps all I ought to ask to do, trying to make my mother comfortable and to keep my father in decent humour. And then, then, when they go I shall be alone in the world. No one will care what becomes of me. Even as it is now, no one cares whether I live or die. This is the discordant note in many a life's music. No one cares. When no one cares for us, we do not care about ourselves or about anybody else. And in not caring, we stumble blindly and unconsciously on our only chance of safety and happiness. A heartless truth, but a truth, for the same. For, when we have become utterly indifferent to destiny, destiny, like a spoiled child, does all she can to attract our notice and manifests a sudden interest in us of which we had never dreamed. And the less we care, the more she clings.

A Christmas Carol (Version 11),Charles Dickens,99918,5.0,"December 20, 2018",[],0,"e visit Librevox.org. A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, Preface and Stave 1. Preface. I have endeavored in this ghostly little book to raise the ghost of an idea, which shall not put my readers out of humor with themselves, with each other, with the season or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly and no one wish to lay it. Their faithful friend and servant, C.D. December 1843. Stave 1. Marley's ghost. Marley was dead to begin with. There was no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker in the chief monor. Scrooge signed it, and Scrooge's name was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a doorknayl. Mind, I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about a doorknayl. I might have been inclined myself to regard a coffin nail as the deadest piece of iron mongery in the trade, but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile, and my unhollowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a doorknayl. Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for, I don't know how many years, Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legate, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain. The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an Easterly wind upon his own ramparts. Then there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot, say St. Paul's churchyard, for instance. Literally to astonish his son's weak mind. Scrooge never painted out old Marley's name. There it stood. Years afterward, above the warehouse door, Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people knew to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him. Oh, but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone Scrooge, a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner. Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire. Secrets and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster, the cold within him froze his old features. Nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened his gate, made his eyes red, his thin lips blue, and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rhyme was on his head, and on his eyebrows and his wierry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him. He iced his office in the dog days, and it didn't thought one degree at Christmas. External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no winchery weather chew him. No wind that blue was bitterer than he. No falling snow was more intent upon its purpose. No pelting rain less open to intrigue. Fow weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often came down handsomely, and Scrooge never did. Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with glad some looks. Might he have scrooge? How are you? When will you come to see me? No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle. No children asked him what it was a clock? No man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place of scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him. And when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts. And then would wag their tails, as though they said, no eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master. But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked, to edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all humans sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call nuts to Scrooge. Once upon a time, of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve. Old Scrooge sat busy in his counting house. It was called bleak, biting weather, foggy with all, and you could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts and stabbing their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clock said only just gone three, but it was quite dark already. It had not been light all day, and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighboring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chinkin' keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere fentums. To see the dinghy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale. The door of Scrooge's counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerks' fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal, but he couldn't replenish it. For Scrooge kept the coal box in his own room, and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle, in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed. A merry Christmas uncle, God save you! Cried a cheerful voice, it was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intemation he had of his approach. He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow, his face was ruddy and handsome, his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again. Chris, miss a humbug uncle. Said Scrooge is nephew. You don't mean that, I am sure. I do. Said Scrooge. Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? Yeah, poor enough. Come then. Return the nephew, Galey. What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be more roast? You're rich enough. Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said, Baaaaa! Again, and followed it up with, humbug. Don't be cross uncle. Said the nephew. What else can I be? Return the uncle. When I live in such a world of fools as this, merry Christmas, out upon merry Christmas. What's Christmas time to you, but a time for pain builds without money? A time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer. A time for balance in your books, and having every item in them, who around does in a month presented dead against you. If I could work, my will. Said Scrooge indignantly. Every idiot who goes about with merry Christmas, on his lips, should be boiled with his own puttin', and buried with a stake of Holly through his hearty should, uncle. Pleaded the nephew. nephew. Return the uncle sternly. Keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mind. Keep it. Repeat it Scrooge's nephew. But you don't keep it. Let me leave it alone then. Said Scrooge. A much good may it do ya, much good it is ever done you. There are many things from which I might have derived good by, which I have not profited, I dare say. Return the nephew. Christmas among the rest, but I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time when it has come round, apart from the veneration due to its sacred name in origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that, as a good time, a kind for giving charitable pleasant time. The only time I know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up parts freely, and to think of people below them, as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys, and therefore uncle. Though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good. And I say, God bless it. The clerk in the tank involuntarily applaud it, becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poke the fire and extinguish the last frail spark, forever. Let me hear another sound from you. Said Scrooge, and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation. They're quite a powerful speaker, sir. He added turning to his nephew. I wonder you don't go into Parliament. Don't be angry uncle. Come, dine with us tomorrow. Scrooge said that he would see him, yes indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first. But why? Cried Scrooge is nephew. Why? Why did you get married? Said Scrooge, because I fell in love. Because you fell in love. Grown Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. Good afternoon. Me, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now? Good afternoon. Said Scrooge, I want nothing from you. I ask nothing of you. Why cannot we be friends? Good afternoon. Said Scrooge, I am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, which I have been a party, but I have made the trial and homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last. So, a merry Christmas, uncle. Good afternoon. Said Scrooge. And a happy new year. Good afternoon. Said Scrooge. Is nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding? He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk. Who called us he was, was warmer than Scrooge, for he returned them cordially. There's another fellow. Muddered Scrooge, you overheard him. My clerk, with 15 shillens a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas, are it tired to bedlam. This lunatic and letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in. They reportedly, gentlemen, pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off and Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him. Scrooge and Marley's I believe. Said one of the gentlemen referring to his list. Have either pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley. Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years. Scrooge replied, He died seven years ago. This very night. We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner. Said the gentleman, presenting his credentials. It certainly was, for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word, liberality, Scrooge frowned and shook his head, and handed the credentials back. That this festive season of a year, Mr. Scrooge. Said the gentleman, taking up a pen, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffered greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries, hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir. Are there no prisons? Asked Scrooge. Plenty of prisons. Said the gentleman laying down the pen again. And the union warecasses? Demanded Scrooge. Are they still in operation? They are still. Return the gentleman. I wish I could say they were not. The treadmill and the poor law are in full vigor, then. Said Scrooge. Both very busy, sir. Oh, I was afraid from what you said at first. That's something had occurred to stop them in their useful course. Said Scrooge. I am very glad to hear it. Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude, return the gentleman. A few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink, and means a warmth. We choose this time because it is a time of all others, when want is keenly felt, and abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for? Nothing. Scrooge replied. You wish to be anonymous? I wish to be left alone. Said Scrooge. Since you ask me when I wish gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make Mary my self at Christmas, and I can't afford to make idle people Mary. I helped to support the establishments I have mentioned. They cost enough, and those who are badly off must go there. Many can't go there, and many would rather die. If they would rather die. Said Scrooge. They had better do it, and decrease this surplus population. Besides, excuse me, I don't know that. But you might know it. Observe the gentleman. It's not my business. Scrooge returned. It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon gentlemen. Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentleman with Drew. Scrooge resumed his laborers with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more fescious temper than was usual with him. Meanwhile, the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proforing their services to go before horses and carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slightly down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street at the corner of the court, some laborers were repairing the gas pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brosier, round-witcher party of ragged men and boys were gathered, warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water plug, the being left in solitude, overflowing, suddenly congealed, and turned to miss-anthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where Holly sprigs in berries, crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces, rotty as they passed. Polterers and grosser strades became a splendid joke, a glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe, that such dull principles as bark and ensail had anything to do. The Lord Mayor in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house, gave orders to his 50 cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as the Lord Mayor's household should. And even the little tailor, whom he had find five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk in blood thirsty in the streets, stirred up tomorrow's pudding in his garot, while his lean wife and the baby salied out to buy the beef. Foggy or yetton colder, piercing searching, biting cold. If the good Saint-Danceen had but nip the evil spirits knows with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one's scant young nose, nod and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are nod by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regal him, with a Christmas carol, but at the first sound of... Scrooge sees the ruler with such energy of action, at the singer-fledent terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial frost. That length, the hour of shutting up the counting house arrived. With an ill-willed, Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expected clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat. Oh, want all day tomorrow, I suppose? Said Scrooge. If quite convenience, sir. It's not convenient. Said Scrooge. And it's not fair. If I was to stop have a crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used all the bound. The clerk smiled faintly. And yet? Said Scrooge. Who don't think me, he'll use when I pay a day's wages for no work? The clerk observed that it was only once a year. A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December? Said Scrooge, butning his great coat to the chin. The clerk promised that he would, and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white-confident dangling, below his waist, for he boasted no great coat. Went down a slide on Cornhill at the end of a lane of boys, and he was at the end of a roundy times, in honor of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Campton Town as hard as he could peelt, to play at blind man's buff. Scrooge took his melancholy dinner, and his usual melancholy tavern, and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his bankers' books, went home to bed. He lived in chambers, which had once belonged to his deceased partner. The room was a room with a little room, and a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying, and must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide and seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge. The other room's being all let out his offices. The yard was so dark, and the fain de grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gate way of the house, that it seemed as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold. Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knucker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact that Scrooge had seen it, night in morning during his whole residence in that place. Also, that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including, which is a bold word, the corporation, alderman, and delivery. But it also be borne in mind, that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon. And then, that any man explained to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knucker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change, not a knucker, but Marley's face. Marley's face. It was not an impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look, with ghostly spectacle turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot air, and though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its vivid color, made it horrible, but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression. As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knucker again. To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key, he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in and lighted his candle. He did pause, with the moments a resolution, before he shut the door, and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's pig tail sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the Scrooge and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, Poo, Poo! and closed it with a bang. The sound resounded through the house like thunder, every room above, and every cask in the wine merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a separate peel of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall and up the stairs, slowly too, trimming his candle as he went. You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young active parliament. But I mean to say, you might have got a herpsup that staircase, and taken it broad-wise with the splinter bar toward the wall, and the door towards the ball of straights. And done it easily. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare, which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive herps going on before him in the gloom. Half a dozen gas lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip. Up Scrooge went, not carrying a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that always right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that. Sitting room, bedroom, lumber room, all as they should be. Nobody under the table. Nobody under the sofa. A small fire in the grate. Spoon and basin ready, and the little saucepan of Grooge, Scrooge had a cold in his head, upon the hob. Nobody under the bed. Nobody in the closet. Nobody in his dressing gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber room as usual. Old fireguard, old shoes, two fish baskets, washing stand on three legs in a poker. Quite satisfied he closed his door, and locked himself in. Double locked himself in. Which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise he took off his crevat, put on his dressing gown and slippers and his nightcap, and sat down before the fire to take his Grooge. It was a very low fire indeed. Nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged as it closed to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles. Designed to illustrate the scriptures. There were canes and ables, ferrows daughters, queens of Sheba, and jellic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather beds. Abraham's belchasars, apostles putting off to see and butterboats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts, and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient prophets' rod and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blanket first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley's head on everyone. Humbuck! Said Scrooge, and walked across the room. After several turns he sat down again, as he threw his head back in the chair his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, and hung in the room and communicated for some purpose now for gotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, with a strange inexplicable dread. As he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound, but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house. This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. Bell ceased as they had begun. Together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise. Deep down below, as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the cast and the wine merchant's cellar. Scrooge and remembered to have heard that ghosts in halted houses were described as dragging chains. The cellar door flew open, with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the forest below, then coming up the stairs, then coming straight toward his door. It's a humbug still. Said Scrooge. I won't believe it. His color changed though, when without a pause, it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up as though it cried. I know him, morally ghost, and fell again. The same face. The very same. Marley and his pig tail, usual waste coat, tights and boots. The tassels on the ladder bristling like his pig tail, and his coat skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about its middle. He was long and wound about him like a tail, and it was made for Scrooge observed it closely, of cashboxes, keys, padlocks, ledgeres, deeds, and heavy purse is rotten steel. His body was transparent, so that Scrooge observing him and looking through his waste coat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind. Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now. No. No way did he believe it even now, although he looked at the phantom through and through, and saw its standing before him, though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes. And marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses. How now? Said Scrooge, Costican cold is ever. What do you want with me? Much. Marley's voice. No doubt about it. Who are you? Ask me who I was. Who were you then? Said Scrooge, raising his voice. Yeah, particular for a shade. He was going to say, two a shade, but substituted this as more appropriate. In life, I was your partner. Jacob Marley. Can you... Can you sit down? Ask Scrooge looking doubtfully at him. I can. Do it then. Scrooge asked the question because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation, but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he were quite used to it. You don't believe in me. Observe the ghost. I don't. Said Scrooge. What evidence would you have of my reality? Beyond that of your senses? I don't know. Said Scrooge. Why do you doubt your senses? The cows. Said Scrooge. A little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an unbiased, just in bit of beef. A blood of mustard. A crumb of cheese. A fragment of an undenned, but data. There's more gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are. Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes. Nor did he feel in his heart, by any means a wagged then. Truth is. But he tried to be smart. As a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror for the spectres voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones. To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment, would play Scrooge felt the very doos with him. There was something very awful too in the spectres being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case. For though the ghosts set perfectly motionless, its hair and skirts and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapor from an oven. You see this toothpick? Said Scrooge returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just a sign and wishing though it were only for a second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself. I do, reply the ghost. You are not looking at it. Said Scrooge, but I see it. Said the ghost, notwithstanding. Well, returned Scrooge. I have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you, humbug. At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and Scrooge's chain was such a dismal and appalling noise that Scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, as a lower draw dropped down upon its breast. Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clashed his hands before his face. Mercy. He said, dreadful apparition, why do you travel me? Man of the worldly mind. Reply the ghost. Do you believe in me or not? I do. Said Scrooge, I must, and that why does spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me? It is required of every man. The ghost returned, that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellow men, and travel far and wide, and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world. Oh, woe is me, and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness. Again, the specter raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands. You are fattered. Said Scrooge, trembling. Tell me why. I wear the chain I forged in life. Reply the ghost. I made it link by link, and yard by yard. I go to the dawn of my own free will, and of my own free will, I, wore it. Is it spattern strange to you? Scrooge, trembling more and more, or would you know? Pursuit the ghost. The weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and long as this seven Christmas eaves ago. You have labored on it since it is a ponderous chain. Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, and the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some 50 or 60 phathoms of iron cable, but he could see nothing. Jacob. He said, and ploringly. All Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak, comfort to me, Jacob. I have none to give. The ghost replied, it comes from other regions, 70s or Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest. I cannot stay. I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting house. Mark me. In life, my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money changing all, and weary journey's life before me. It was a habit with Scrooge. Whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breechous pockets, pondering on what the ghost had said he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees. You must have been very slow about it, Jacob. Scrooge observed in a business like manner, although with humility and death-rins. Slow? The ghost repeated. Seven years, dead. News, Scrooge. And traveling all the time. The whole time. Said the ghost. No rest. No peace. Incessant torture of remorse. You travel fast. Said Scrooge. On the wings of the wind. Replied the ghost. You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years. Said Scrooge. The ghost on hearing this said up another cry, and clank its chains so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the ward would have been justified in inditing it for a nuisance. Oh, captive bound in the double ironed! cried the phantom. Not to know that ages of incestent labor by immortal creatures, but as earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible, is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short, or its vast means of usefulness, not to know that no space of regret could make a man's for one life's opportunity misused. Yet such was I, all such was I. But they were always a good man of business Jacob. Faulted Scrooge who now began to apply this to himself. Business! cried the ghost ringing its hands again. Man, kind was my business. The common welfare was my business charity, mercy for parents and benevolence. Were all my business. The dealings of my trade were a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business. It held up its chain at arms of length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again. At this time of the rolling year, of the specter said, I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow beings, with my eyes turned down, and never raised them to that blessed star, which led the wise men to a poor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me? Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the specter going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly. Hear me! cried the ghost. My time is nearly gone. I will. Since Grouch. But don't be hard on me. Don't be flowery Jacob. Pray. How is it that I appear before you, in a shape that you can see? I may not tell. I have sat in visible beside you. Many and many of day. It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow. That is no light part of my penance. Pursued the ghost. I am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance in hope of escaping my fate. A chance in the hope of my procuring of a deser. You were always a good friend to me. Said Scrooge. Thank you. You will be haunted. Resume the ghost. By three spirits. Scrooge's countenance fell, almost as low as the ghost said done. Is that the chance and hope you mentioned Jacob? He demanded in a faltering voice. It is. I... I think I'd rather not. Said Scrooge. Without their visits, said the ghost. You cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to morrow when the bell tolls one. Can I take him all at once and have it over Jacob? Hinted Scrooge. Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more. And look at who your own sake. You remember what has passed between us. When it had said these words, the specter took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor, confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and about its arm. The apparition walked backward from him, and at every step it took, although window raised itself a little, so that when the specter reached it it was wide open. It backened Scrooge to a proge, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Marley's ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped. Not so much an obedient says in surprise and fear. For on the raising of the hand he became sensible of, confused noises in the air. In coherent sounds of lamentation and regret, wellings in expressibly sorrowful and self accusatory, the specter after listening for a moment joined in the mournful durs, and floated out upon the bleak dark night. Scrooge followed to the window, desperate in his curiosity, he looked out. The air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and tither in restless hasten, moaning as they went, every one of them were chains like Marley's ghost. Some few, they might be guilty, governments were linked together, none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waste coat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried pitiously at being unable to assist the wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep, the misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere for good, in human matters, and had lost the power forever. Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they, in their spirit voices faded together, and the night became, as it had been, when he walked home, Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the ghost had entered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say, Humbug! But stopped at the first syllable, and being from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the invisible world, or the dull conversation of the ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose, when straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.

The Double Life Of Mr. Alfred Burton,E. Phillips Oppenheim,220986,3.0,"January 31, 2018",[],0," please visit Librevox.org. Recording by Linda O'Senfaitak Los Angeles. The double life of Mr Alfred Burton by E. Phillips-Ophingheim, Chapter 1. The fruit of the tree. Mr Alfred Burton, although he was blissfully and completely ignorant of the fact, stood at the door of fate. He was a little out of breath, and his silk hat was reclining at the back of his head. In his mouth was a large cigar, which he felt certain was going to disagree with him, but he smoked it, because it had been presented to him a few minutes ago, by the client, upon whom he was in attendance. He had rather deep set blue eyes, which might have been attractive, but for a certain keenness in their outlook, which was in a sense indicative of the methods and character of the young man himself. He pale, characterless face, a struggling, sandy mustache, and an earnest, not say, convincing manner. He was dressed in such garments as the head clerk of Messer's wedding-tuning forms, third-rate auctioneers, and house agents might have been expected to select. He dangled a bunch of keys in his hand. If this is, don't suit you, sir. You declared confidently. Why? There isn't one in the old Westin that will. That's my opinion anyway. There's nothing in our books to compare with it for value and accommodation. When early-let it last week to Lord Lekin's side, but our ladyship, she came round with me, herself, decided that it was just a trifle too large, as a matter of fact, sir. This energetic young man went on, confidentially. The governor insisted upon a deposit, and it didn't seem to be exactly convenient. It isn't always these people with titles who've got the money. That we find out, nor business, quickly as anybody. As for the steaming, you were talking about Mr. Lin, why there's all very well for New York. He continued, persuasively. But over here, the climate doesn't go for it. You can take it from me that it doesn't indeed, Mr. Lin. I have the letting in me ends of as many areas as most people, and you can take it from me, sir, as the direct result of no experience that over here, they won't have it. They won't have it at any price, sir. Most on the healthy we find it, and always produces a rare crop of colds and coughs on known to those that are used to an honest, cold fire. It's all a matter of climate, sir, after all isn't it. The young man paused to take breath. His client, who had been listening attentively in gloomy, but not on a appreciative silence, removed his cigar from his mouth. He was a middle-aged American with a wife and daughter's on their way over from New York, and his business was to take a house before they arrived. It wasn't a job he liked, but he was making the best of it. This young man appealed to his sense of business. Say, he remarked, approvingly, he of learned how to talk in your trade. Stimulated by this encouragement, Alfred Burton clapped on his hut a little more securely, took a long breath, and went at it again. Why I'm giving myself a rest this morning, sir. He declared, I have entrusted her you more than the bare facts. This house doesn't need any talk in about. Doesn't need a word said about it. Our lady ships last words to us were, lady either may you know the owner of the house. Mr. Widington and Mr. Burton, she said, she was speaking to us both for the governor always introduces be to clients as being the one who does most of the letting. Mr. Widington and Mr. Burton, she said, if a tenant comes along or you think I'd like to have living in me rooms and using my furniture, breathing my air so to speak, why go ahead and let the house rinse being shockingly low just now with agricultural depression and whatnot, but sooner than not let it to gentle people all do without the money. A lady ship declared, now you're just the sort of tenant she'd like to have here, aren't quite sure of that, Mr. Lene. I should take a pleasure and bring in you two together. Mr. Lene granted, he was perfectly well aware that the house would see more desirable to his wife and daughters from the very fact that it belonged to a lady. Anybody? He was perfectly well aware also that his companion had suspected this. The consideration of these facts left him however, unaffected. He was disposed of anything to admire the cleverness of the unman who had realized an outside asset. Who else I've seen pretty well all over it, he remarked, I'll go back to the office with you anyhow and have a word with Mr. Widington. By the way, what's that room behind you? The young man glanced, carelessly around at the door of the room of fate, and down at the bunch of keys which he held in his hand. He even chuckled as he replied. I was going to mention the matter of that room, sir. He replied, because, if perfectly agreeable to the tenant, our lady ship would like to keep it locked up. Locked up, Mr. Lynn repeated, and why? Regular queer stories, sir, the young man declared, confidently. The light, Earl, was a great traveler in the east, as you may have had, and he was always peeping about in some ruins, city or other in the desert, and picking up things and making discoveries. Well, last time he came home from a broad, he brought them in Old Egyptian or Arab, I don't know which he was, but he was brown. Settled him down in his room in his own house mine, and wouldn't have him disturbed or interfered with not at any price. Well, the old chup worked here night and day at some sort of writing, and then naturally enough, what, with not having some sort of grubby light, and never going outside the doors, he croaked. He what, Mr. Lynn interposed. He died, the young man explained. It was just about the time that the hour was ill himself. His lordship gave orders that the body was to be buried in the room locked up, in case the old chap says should come along, seems he'd brought a few odd things of his own over. Nothing would ever have any value. Anyway, those were Lord idle mayes wishes, and the room has been locked up ever since. Mr. Lynn was interested. No objection to are just looking inside, I suppose. None whatever, the young man declared promptly. Oh, he's going ever peeped me self, here goes. He fitted the key in the lock, and pushed the door open. Mr. Lynn took one step forward, and drew back hurriedly. Thanks, he said, that'll do. I've seen all I want. Ensmeled. Mr. Alfred Burton, fortunately, or unfortunately, was possessed of less sensitive nasal organs, and an indomitable curiosity. The room was dark and stuffy, and a wave of pungent, odors swept out upon them with the opening of the door. Nevertheless, he did not immediately close it. One moment, he muttered, peering inside, odors look around and see that everything is in order. He crossed the threshold, and passed into the room. It was certainly a courier apartment. The walls were hung not with paper at all, but with rugs of some oriental material, which had the effect of still further increasing the gloom. There were neither chairs nor tables, no furniture at all, in fact, of any account, but in the furthest corner was a great pile of cushions, and on the floor by the side a plain strip of sandalwood covered with a purple cloth, on which were several square shaped sheets of paper, a brass, ink stand, and a bundle of quill pins. On the extreme corner of this strip of wood, which seemed to have been used as a writing desk by someone reclining upon the cushions, was the strangest article of all. Alfred Burton stared at it with wide open eyes. It was a tiny plant, growing out of a small sized flower pot, with real green leaves, and a cluster of queer little brown fruit hanging down from among them. Gemini, the clock exclaimed. I say, Mr. Linsa. But Mr. Lins had gone off to pace the dining room once more. Burton moved slowly forward, and stooped down over the cushions. He took up the sheets of paper which lay upon the slab of sandalwood. They were covered with hurly indescifortable characters, save for the last page only and there. Even as he stood with it, in his fingers, he saw, underneath the concluding paragraph of those unintelligible hieroglyphics, a few words of faintly traced English, laboriously printed, probably a translation. He struck a match and read them slowly out to himself. It is finished. The 19th generation has triumphed. A, who shall eat, of the brown fruit of this tree, shall see the things of life and death as they are. He, who shall eat, the translation concluded abruptly. Mr. Alfred Burton removed his silk hat, and reflectively scratched his head. Queer sort of joke, gore must have been, remarked to himself, oh wonder what he was getting at. His eyes fell upon the little tree. He filled the earth in the pot. It was quite dry. Yet the tree itself was fresh and green. Eagos were a brown bean, he continued, and plucked one. Even then, while he held it in his fingers, he hesitated. Don't suppose it will do me any arm, he muttered, debtfully. There was naturally no reply. Mr. Alfred Burton laughed unisily to himself. The shadows of the room and its curious perfume were a trifle disconserting. Reskit anyway, he concluded. Eagos, he raised the little brown fruit, which did indeed somewhat resemble a bean, to his mouth, and swallowed it. He found it quite tasteless, but the deed was no sooner done than he was startled by a curious buzzing in his ears, and a momentary but peculiar lapse of memory. He sat and looked around him like a man who has been asleep and suddenly awakened in unfamiliar surroundings. Then the sound of his client's voice suddenly recalled him to himself. He started up and peered through the gloom. Who's there? He asked, sharply. Say young man, I'm waiting for you when you're quite ready. Mr. Lee and remarked from the threshold. Queer sort of atmosphere and there isn't it. Mr. Alfred Burton came slowly out and locked the door of the room. Even then, he was dimly conscious that something had happened to him. He hated the musty odor of the place, the dusty, unswebbed hall, and the general air of desertion. He wanted to get out into the street, and he hurried his client toward the prep door, as soon as he had locked up, he breathed a little sigh of relief. What a delicious soft wind he exclaimed, removing his unsightly hat. Really, I think that when we get a sunny day like this, April is almost almost beautiful month. Mr. Lee stared at his companion who was now slowly descending the steps. Say about this house, he began. I guess I'd better take it. It may not be exactly what I want, but it seems to me to be about as near as anything I am likely to find. We'll go around to the office right away and fix things up. Mr. Alfred Burton shook his head, doubtfully. I don't think I would take it if I were you, Mr. Lee. He said. Mr. Lee stopped short upon the pavement, and looked at his companion in a nasement. The latter had the air of one very little interest in the subject of conversation. He was watching a provingly, a barrel full of lilac, and other spring flowers being wheeled along by a flower cellar in the middle of the road. What an exquisite perfume! The young man murmured enthusiastically. Doesn't it remind you, Mr. Lee, of a beautiful garden somewhere right away in the country? One of those old fashioned gardens, you know, with narrow paths where you have to push your way through the flowers, and where there's always great beds of pink and white stocks near the boxages. And do you notice? An accident, of course, but what a delicate blend of colour, the lilac, and those yellow junkwills, Mike. I can't smell anything. The American declared a little impatiently. And I don't know as I want to just now. I'm here to talk business if you're not mind. In one moment, Burton replied. Excuse me for one moment, if you please. He hastened across the street, and returned a moment or two later with a bunch of violence in his hand. Mr. Lee watched him, partly in an amazement, partly in disapproval. There seemed to be very little left of the smart, business like young man, whose methods only a short time ago had commanded his unwilling admiration. Mr. Alfred Burton's expression had undergone a complete change. His eyes had lost their calculating twinkle, his mouth had softened. He pleasant, but somewhat, abstracted smile had taken the place of his forced, amyability. Your will forgive me won't, too. He said, as he regained the pavement. Oh, I really haven't smelt violence before, this year. Spring comes upon us Londoner so suddenly. About that house now, the American insisted a little sharply. Certainly, Burton replied, removing his eyes unwillingly from the passing barrow. I really don't think you'd better take it, Mr. Lee. You see, it is not generally known, but there is no doubt that Lord either may, had typhoid fever there. Typhoid, Mr. Lee unexclaimed, incredulously. His companion nodded. Two of the servants were down with it as well. He continued. We implored Lady Either way, when she offered us the lectern of the house, to have the drains put in thorough order, but when we got the estimate out for her, she absolutely declined. To tow the truth, the best agents that all refused under the circumstances of the O's upon their books at all, that is why we got the let-knove it. Mr. Lee removed the cigar from his mouth for a moment. There was a slight frown upon his forehead. He was puzzled. Say, you're not getting at me for any reason, are you? He demanded. Might yet, sir, Burton protested eagerly. I'm simply doing my duty, and telling you the truth. The O's is not an affidstate to be let to anyone, certainly not to a man with a family. If you will permit me to say so, you're not going the right way to secure a suitable house. You simply walked into our office, because you saw the sign-up and listened to anything the governor had to say. We haven't any West End O's as at all upon our books. It isn't our business, unfortunately. Miller and Sons O'Roskos are the best people. No one would even come to see you at Einal Nias, much less stay with you, the place as such a bad reputation. Then will you be good enough to just explain to me why you are cracking it up like blazes only a few minutes ago? Mr. Lee demanded. Indignantly. I nearly took the darn place. Mr. Burton shook his head, penitently. Arm afraid that I cannot explain, sir. He confessed. To tell you the truth, I don't understand and the least, how I could have brought me self to be so untruthful. I am only thankful that no arm has been done. They had reached the corner of the street, in which the offices of Messier's Woddington and Forbes were situated. Mr. Lin came to a full stop. I can't see, but what we might just as well part here, young man, he declared. There's no use in my coming to your office after what you've told me. Not the slightest. Mr. Burton admitted frankly. In fact, you are better away. Mr. Woddington would certainly try to persuade you to take the oath. If you'll accept my advice, sir, you will go to Miller and Sun's insane James Place. They have all the best houses on their books, and they are almost certain to find something to suit you. Mr. Lin gazed once more at his companion, curiously. Say, I'm not quite sure that I can size you up even now. He said. At first I thought you were a rare little hustler right on the job. I was set against that house and yet you almost persuaded me into taking it. What's come over you anyway? Mr. Burton shook his head, dubiously. On the freight that it's no use asking me. He replied, for I really don't quite know me self. Mr. Lin still lingered. The longer he looked at his companion, the more he appreciated the subtle change of demeanor and language which had certainly transformed Mr. Alfred Burton. It was after you came out of that little room, he continued meditatively, where that oriental fellow had been shut up. The more I think of it, the order it seems. You were as perky as mustard when you went in and you've been sort of days, ever since you came out. Mr. Burton lifted his hat. Good day, sir. He said, I trust that you will find a residence to suit you. Mr. Lin strolled off with a puzzled frown upon his forehead and Alfred Burton, with a slight gesture of a version, pushed open the swinging doors which led into the offices of messers, weddington and Forbes.

beginning of things But the various folk who first told them were so very different The tales are so very old and have changed so greatly in the telling from one generation to another That there are almost as many accounts of the way in which the world began as there are nations upon the earth So it is not strange that the people of the north have a legend of the beginning quite different from that of the southern, eastern and western folk This book is made of the stories told by the northern folk The people who live in the land of the midnight sun Where summer is green and pleasant but winter is a terrible time of cold and gloom Where rocky mountains tower like huge giants over whose heads the thunder rolls and crashes And under whose feet are minds of precious metals Therefore you

all father Odin is king And where border the beautiful makes springtime with his smile In the north countries winter cold and frost are very real and terrible enemies While spring sunshine and warmth are near and dear friends So the story of the beginning of things is a story of cold and heat Of the wicked giants who loved the cold and of the good isin who baths in pleasant warmth In the very beginning of things the stories say there were two worlds one of burning heat and one of icy cold The cold world was in the north and from it flowed Elivergar A river of poisonous water which hardened into ice And piled up into great mountains filling the space which had no bottom The other world in the south was on fire with bright flame A place of heat most terrible And in those days through all space there was nothing beside these two worlds of heat and cold But then began a fierce combat heat and cold met and stroked to destroy each other as they have tried to do ever since Flaming spot from the hot world fell upon the ice river which flowed from the place of cold And though the bright sparks were quenched in dying they wrote mischief as they do today But they mounted the ice which dripped and dripped like tears from the suffering world of cold And then wonderful to say these chilly drops became alive They came a huge breathing mass a frost giant with a wicked heart of ice And he was the ancestor of all the giants who came afterwards A bad and cruel race At that time there was no earth nor sea nor heaven Nothing but the icy abyss without bottom Wents, in air the giant had sprung And there he lived, nourished by the milk of a cow which the heat had formed Now the cow had nothing for her food but the snow and ice of Elevagar And that was called vittles indeed One day she was looking at the icy rocks which tasted salty to her When a mere noticed that the mass was taking a strange shape The more the cow looked it the plane had become the outline of the shape And when the evening came a mere saw trusting itself through the icy rock A head of hair The next day the cow went on with her meal And at night time a man's head appeared above the rock On the third day the cow looked to wave the ice Until fourth stepped a man, tall and powerful and handsome This was no evil giant for he was good And strangely though he came from the ice his heart was warm He was the ancestor of the kind Eceir For all father Odin and his brothers, Vili and Ray The first of the gods were his grand sons And as soon as they were born they became the enemies of the race of giants Now after a few giant years, ages and ages of time as we reconnect There was a great battle for Odin and his brothers Wish to destroy all the evil in the world and to leave only good They attacked the wicked giant, I mean, first of all his race And after hard fighting flew him In me there was so huge that when he died a mighty river of blood Float from the wounds which Odin had given him The stream so large that it flooded all space And the frost giants, his children and grandchildren were drowned Except one who escaped with his wife in a chest And but for the saving of these two that would have been the end of the race of giants All father and his brothers now had work to do Painfully they dragged the great bulk of him in into the bottomless space of ice And from it they built the earth, the sea and the heavens Not an atom of his body went to waste His blood made the great ocean, the rivers, lakes and springs His mighty bones became mountains, his teeth and broken bones made sand and pebbles And from his skull they fashioned the arching heaven Which they set up over the earth and sea His brain became the heavy clouds, his hair sprouted into trees Groths, plants and flowers And last of all the isseers set his bristling eyebrows as a high fence around the earth To keep the giants away from the race of men who may have planned to create for this pleasant globe So the earth was made and next the gods brought light for the heavens They caught the sparks and sinders blown from the world of heat And set them here and there above and below As sun and moon and stars To each they gave its name and told what its duties were to be And how it must perform there day after day And year after year and century after century Till the ending of all things So that the children of men might recon time without mistake So and many who drove the bright chariots of the sun and moon across the sky What a fair sister and brother whose father named them sun and moon Because they were so beautiful So oden gave them each a pair of swift bright horses to drive And set them in the sky forever Once upon a time that was many, many years later Manied the man in the moon, sold two children from the earth Hayoki and Bill were going to a well to draw a pale of water The little boy and girl carried a pole and debuck it across their shoulders And looked so pretty that manny thrust down a long arm And snatched them up to his moon And there they are to this day As you can see on any moon like night Two little black shadows on the moon's bright face The boy and the girl with the bucket between them The gods also made day and night Day was fair bright and beautiful For he was of the warmhearted a theorist But night was dark and gloomy Because she was one of the cold giant folk Day and night had each a chariot drawn by a swift horse And each in turn drove about the world in a 24 hours journey Night drove first behind her dark horse Grimfaxi who scattered dew from his bit upon the sleeping earth After her came day with his beautiful horse, glad Who shining main shot rays of light through the sky All these wonders the kind gods wrote That they might make a pleasant world for men to call their home And now the gods are a series they were called Must choose a place for their own dwelling For there were many of them, aglorious family Outside of everything, beyond the great ocean Which surrounded the world was yout and high The cold country where the giants lived The green earth was made for men The gods therefore decided to build their city Above men in their heavens Where they could watch the doings of their favourites And protect them from the wicked giants Asgard was to be their city And from Asgard to Midgard, the home of men Stretched a wonderful bridge, a bridge of many colours For it was the rainbow that we know and love Up and down the rainbow bridge, the S.I.C. could travel to the earth And thus keep close to the doings of men Next from the remnants of Ime's body The gods made the race of little dwarfs A wise folk couldn't skillful But in nature more like the giants Then like the good S.I.A For they were spiteful and often wicked And they loved the dark and the cold Better than light and warmth They lived deep down below the ground In caves and rocky dens And it was their business to dig the precious metals And glittering gems that were hidden in the rocks And to make wonderful things from the treasures of the underworld Poof, poof went the little bellows Ting, tang went their little hammers On their little animals all day and all night Sometimes they were friendly to the giants And sometimes they did kindly deeds for the S.I.A But always after men came upon the earth They hated these new folk Who easily sought for the gold and the jewels Which the dwarfs kept hidden in the ground The dwarfs lost no chance in doing evil to the race of men Now the gods were ready for the making of men They longed to have a race of creatures who may could love and protect And to bless with all kinds of pleasures So Odin, with his brothers, Enia and Loki Cross the rainbow bridge and came down to the earth They were walking along the seashell When they found two trees and ash and an owl These would do as well as anything for their purpose Odin took the two trees and wore me briefed upon them And lo, they were alive, a man and a woman Enia and then gently touch their foreheads and they became wise Lastly, Loki softly stroked their faces Their skin grew pink with redicolor And they received the gifts of speech, hearing and sight Ask and emblah with their names And the ash and the owl became the father and mother Of the whole human race Whose dwelling was mith got under the eyes of the Assyr Who had made them This is the

Harper's Young People, Volume 1, Issue 12, January 20, 1880. Poor Pussy comes at break of day and wakes me up to make me play. And I am such a sleepy head that I'd much rather stay in bed. Our own star. As we have already begin the professor, had a talk about the stars in general. Let us this morning give a little attention to our own particular star. Is there a star that we can call our own? How nice! I wonder if it can be the one I saw from our front window last evening. That looked so bright and beautiful. I am sure it was not. Said the professor. If you saw it in the evening. Is it hard to see our star then, she said? Well, by no means, we applied the professor. Rather, it is hard not to see it. But you must be careful about looking directly at it. Well, your eyes will be badly dazzled. It is so very bright. Our star is no other than the sun. And we are right in calling it a star. Because all the stars are suns. And very likely give light and heat to worlds as large as our earth. Though they are also far off. We cannot see them. Our star seems so much brighter and hotter than the others. Only because it is so much newer to us than they are. Though still, it is some 92 millions of miles away. How big is the sun? Asked Joe. You can get the clearest idea of its size by a comparison. The earth is 7,920 miles in diameter. That is, as measured right through the center. Now suppose it's to be only one inch. Or about as large as a plum. Or a half-grown peach. Then we would have to regard the sun as three yards in diameter so that if it were in this room, it would reach from the floor. Or to the ceiling. How do they find out that distance of the sun? Asked Joe. Until lately, we applied the professor. The same method was pursued as in surveying. That is, by measuring lines and angles. An angle you know is the corner made by two lines coming together. As in the letter V. But that method did not answer very well. As it did not make the distance, searchin' within several millions of miles. Quite recently, Professor Newcom is found out a way of measuring the sun's distance. By the velocity of its light, he has invented a means of learning exactly how fast light moves. And then, by comparing this with the time, light takes to come from the sun to us. He's able to tell how far off the sun is. Thus, if a man knows how many miles he walks in an hour, and how many hours it takes him to walk to a certain place, he can very easily figure up the number of miles it is away. Why? Said Gus, that sun's just like what Bob Steppen said the other day in school. He has a big silver watch that he is mighty fond of hauling out of his pocket before everybody. A caterpillar came crawling through the door and went right toward the teacher's desk at the other end of the room. Now, said Bob, if that fellow were only keep straight ahead, I can tell how long the room is. So out came the watch, and Bob wrote down the time, and how many inches the caterpillar traveled in a minute. But just then Sally Smith came across his track with her long dress and swept him to Jericho. We boys all laughed out. Sally Blushton got angry, and the teacher kept us in after school. The astronomers have the same kind of troubles, said the professor. They incur great labor and expense to take some particular observation that is possible only once in a number of years, and then for only a few minutes, and after their instruments were all carefully set up, and their calculations made, the clouds spread over the sky, and hide everything they wish to see. People too were very active laugh at their disappointment. There would, however, be no science of astronomy, if those who pursued it were discouraged by common difficulties. To explain the heavenly bodies, they sometimes tried to make little systems or images of the sun in the planets. But they are never able to show the sizes and distances correctly. If they were to begin by making the sun one inch in diameter, then the earth would have to be three yards off, as small as a grain of dust. Some of the planets would have to be across the street, and others away beyond the opposite houses. So when you look at these little solar systems, as they are called, you must remember that the sizes and distances are all wrong. Still, you can get from them some idea how the sun stands in the middle, and the earth and other planets go round, and how the earth, while going round the sun, keeps also turning itself around. You have seen how a top, while spinning, sometimes runs round in a circle, that is just the way our earth does. And if you imagine a candle in the center of the circle that the top makes, you will see why it is sometimes day and sometimes night. When the sight of the earth we are on is turned toward the sun, we have day. And when we have spun past the sun, night comes. The sun seems to go past us, and people used to think it really did. But we know now that it is, as if we are in a rail car, and the trees and houses seem to be rushing along, when we ourselves are the ones that are moving. The sun and all the stars seem to move through the sky, from east to west, but it is only our earth that is turning itself the other way, and carrying us with it. What makes summer and winter, as Joe? I think the top will help you to understand that too. You have noticed that when it spins, it does not always stand straight up, but often leans over to one side, so sometimes the upper part of it would be toward the candle, and sometimes over away from it. The earth leans over to in the same manner, and that is the reason why we have summer and winter. When by this leaning our part of the earth is toward the sun, we get more heat, and we have a warm season, when we are leaning away from the sun, and are more in the shadow. The cold weather comes, and continues until we get into a good position to be warmed up again. A kind providence brings us all around very regularly, and there is no danger of our being kept so long in the cold that we would freeze to death. Everything works like a clock that is never allowed to run down or get out of order. In spinning, the earth carries us around 12 or 15 times as fast as the fastest railway train has ever been made to run, and in making it circle around the sun, it moves as fast as shot from a gun. Oh, oh, explain the children, and Joe asked, why are we not all dashed to pieces? Because, said the professor, we do not run against anything large enough to do any harm, and we do not realize how fast we are moving, or we are moving at all, because we do not pass near anything that is standing still. You know that in riding we look at the trees and fences by the roadside, to see how rapidly we are going. The hills and the distance do not show our speed, but seem to be following us. Unless we look outside we can not know anything about it, excepting perhaps. We may guess from the noise and jostling of the vehicle. But as the earth moves smoothly, and without the least noise, we would think it stood entirely still, did not astronomers assure us of its wonderfully rapid motion. It took them a great while to find out, when they began to suspect it. There was a great dispute over it. Some said it moved, other said it did not. The two parties were for a time, and very bitter against each other. But now all agree in and believe of its rapid motion. A queer thing to quarrel about, I must say, remarked to us. I wouldn't have cared a straw whether it moved or not, if I could only have been allowed to move about, on it as I pleased. I hope you are not getting uneasy, Gus. So Joe. There was evident reason, observed Jack, to suspect that his appreciation of the marbles of science is insufficient to preserve. Oh, bother, Jack, don't give us your college stuff now after the professor has told us so much. We like to hear him, of course. I do, for one, a great deal better than I thought I would should. But then a fellow can't help getting tired. Babies eyes. When the babies eyes are blue, think we of a summer day, violets and dancing rills, when the babies eyes are gray, doves and dawn are brought to mind. Brown, of gentle fonds we dream, and ripe nuts and shady woods. Jack, of midnight skies that gleam, with bright stars, but blue are gray. Black are brown like flower or star. Sweeter eyes can never be. To mama and babies are.

I find it very hard to say what is most dear, the task that brings bread to the eater, or the rest that follows toil. The love of friends of books of song. Each is most blessed and always with contentment of blends. A stone afagget or a flower, a bird in rapture of its flight, December snow our apos shallower. The velvet vastness of the night. When mother moon has left the stars and with the winds gone gossiping, or leans upon the gate that bars dawn from untimely entering. These hold for me unending charm, fill me with wonderment and awe that men should ever think of harm, fencing their lives about with law. The world is such a lovely place, a jeweled pinded on love's chain. I marvel that a human face should pale with anger or with pain. I marvel at the cry for bread that thunders round the waking world, the tumult of the legions tread that shakes the earth as souls are hurled in battle to destroy the souls God grew in his great garden when he won past all his other goals, triumpment at the birth of men. Who can behold the dance of dawn, juggling with stars like tinsled balls vestured in mantle of a wand white glory, whose dim splendor falls upon the mountains and not feel himself transcendent. Who can hear clear a wild bird's and the peel of mountain bells across the clear blue sky, co-mingling with the shout of children on their way to school, and fail at once to be about God's business. As within a pool you are reflected, nature shows the miracle of what you are, the highest that creation knows, Lord of the earth and every star. I am a priest upon whose head God long ago poured holy oil. He gave me a word and said, with this thou shalt mankind a soul. I come from out the holy place with benediction for the earth to wipe the tears from every face and tell the fallen one his word. My business is to be a priest whose holy task is to forgive, to bid the beggar to the feast, to test the dead and make them live. I know not any fear of thrones nor claim of scribe and ferocene. My word is set to many tones of loot and harp and sultry. I have no temple and no creed. I celebrate no mystic right. The human heart is all I need, where and I worship day and night. The human heart is all I need, for I have found God ever there. Love is the one sufficient creed and comradeship the purest prayer. I bow not down to any book, no written page holds me in awe, for when on one friend's face I look I read the prophets and the law. I need no fountain filled with blood to cleanse my soul from mortal sin, for love is an unbounded flood. freely I go to wash their end, love laughs at boundaries of wrath and is as infinite as God. breaks down each wall, finds out each path where willful strain feet of God. Love is the word God gave and said, with it thou shalt mankind to soil. Then forthwith poured upon my head a noteine of his holy oil.

A big rocket freighter was speeding through the star dust of outer space. It was carrying supplies to Calistto, one of the 12 moons of Jupiter and the Shannons on another space adventure. Steven Sue looked out a window of the freighter at the Aerospace World, Crowing in size. Calistto was a gigantic roughened rock, but it was a glowed larger than a planet Mercury. It reminded Steve of the giant cocklepur hanging in his sky. Suddenly the children heard a tiny voice behind them saying, Rocket away, they turned and explained it's bud. The blue parrarchy, a budgie, blizzardly at them. The twins had met Mr. Wittles Pet a week ago. He had taken a liking to them from the very start. They didn't know that a few hours from now, they very lied, with depend on this little fellow. We better take him back to Mr. Wittles. Steve said, the budgie kept studying them with his flat face and blinking his tiny but nice. Then he swapped again. Rocket away. It'll be rocket away for you young fellow. Steve sits down late. On my finger, bud. The bird did as he was ordered. They took him down the hall to Mr. Wittles room. Bud's owner, off duty now, was a tall spider-y croman with a big Adam's apple. He always gave his pet full run of the ship. Mr. Wittles whistled to the parrarchy, but the bird stayed on Steve's finger. Mr. Wittles tripled, hey, I believe he likes you too better than his master. I can too, suit him the croman. You can keep him for a few days. If you want to, Mr. Wittles said, I'm going to be pretty busy. How to reland. Gee, we'd like to look out to him. Steve answered, if you take him outside on the police, though, you'll have to put him in that airtight cage over there. I had made it sort of like a space suit for him. So, instead played with Bud in the room, they used for games. Until it was time to strap down for a landing. Then they went to the couch hall and lay down on cops like the other stray's travelers were doing. They buckled straps across their bodies to keep them in place. For a long time, Steve and Sue lay there as the big freighter began cutting its rushing speed. It felt to Steve as a giant and velver crushing downward on his chest. Take off and landing were always the roughest moments in space travel. As the twins had already found out on other space trips. At last, the ships had down on Polista. The young shannons went back to the game run. Then, with the bird on Steve shoulder, the twins looked up to window at the strange world. They saw a land made in thosely twilight. Very little light was coming from the sun. It was so far away that it was only a small circle. Most of the light came from a huge shape that looked like somebody's lost each ball resting on the ground. It's bottom edge just touched the horizon. Sue and Steve were joined by their father who worked for the space freight company. That's his majesty, Jupiter, the king of planets, Mr. Shannon told them he's over a million miles away and yet he looks close enough to touch, doesn't he? Let's go outdoors, Dad. Steve back. No reason why we can't Mr. Shannon replied. After they had put on their space clothes, Steve popped butt into his warm airtight cage. As they all went outside, they saw the crewman unloaded the cargo. There's the colony over there, Mr. Shannon said, quantity to a high framework, but looked something like an oil dairy. They mine here for a mineral called magna. It's very valuable because without it, we wouldn't have atomic engines. Magna is what keeps our rocket tubes from melting under the terrific heat thickers through them. May we go down into the mines, Dad, Steve asked, we'll see if we can't set his father as they walked toward the mining place. Mr. Shannon said, underneath us our pockets of poisonous gas, like that found in Jupiter's atmosphere. Sometimes it leaks into the mining tunnels, causing danger from suffocation. I sure hope the gas phase were belongs well we're down there. Steve said, and swallowed the lump of fear it has throed. They turned their attention to Jupiter, and looked even more like a beach ball now, but it describes a beautiful colors. Mr. Shannon said, the band were floating in icebergs of the poisonous gases he was talking about. No ship can land on Jupiter. He said, its gravity would crush a space map flat. Gravity pole is much stronger on the larger planet. Jupiter's atmosphere is many thousands of miles deep. Raging storms are going on beneath it all the time. Ooh, suit gas. I guess we're close enough to it then. Other wonders of this guy were the round-feakings of Jupiter's other runs. Three of which were about the same size as Calisto. They hung like bright search flights in the story heavens. The men at the mining place created the shadans warmly. They had not seen anyone from earth for so long that they had run very lonely. The chief mining engineer said he would be glad to take the visitors on an underground tour. His name was Dr. Harding. He was plumb and shortly, and worked like rented glasses inside his basic helmet. He let them into an elevator and it sank into the darkness. Steve remembered about the poisonous gases that crept about underground and had made him shiver to think about it. Dr. Harding watched a bud hopping around uncomfortably inside his small space cage. Did you remember Mr. Shannon? He asked over his suit radio. When they used to use canary birds and mines to warn about leaking gas, the birds would notice it first and get the miners time to get out. I've read about that Dr. Harding. Said Mr. Shannon. Now we have automatic warning machines in the tunnels to do that that you've been junior told, Sue, and Steve. Deeper and deeper below the soil of Calisto, the elevator sank. At last the cage reached the bottom and the riders found themselves into large cavern. There were machines and men all about working busily. Tracks led off into tunnels and ore cars were running on them. Some were going empty into the tunnels while others were coming out full of rock and gravel. The magma is separated from the rock and that big machine over there. Dr. Harding explained, want to ride an ore car into one of the tunnels. Sure, Steve spoke up. The mine is air conditioned. The chief engineer said, So we can take off our helmets. This done, Steve let bud out of his cage. The little bird popped up on his glove finger saying, Rocket away several times. His two word language seemed to do for everything. One worker controlled all the cars at a main switch in the middle of the cavern. The shannons and their guide climbed into an empty or car, into a tunnel, listening dark rock crowded in on soon. Steve from all sides. Steve hooked the walls were strung out. So they would not compression down on their heads. There were lights along the way to help brightly the bloom. After clicking along like a trolling for a while, the car came to the end of the line. It was a large room with more machines and workmen. The men were digging magma or out of the wall with drills. As Dr. Harding explained about the work, but began blitting about as though sightseeing on his own. He was shy of the workers at first, but then made friends with them. He spoke to them with his favorite two words in the men laughed and raped fun to hear him. Then a few minutes later, but began acting clearly. You've been back to Steve's finger and started wobbling as though dizzy. What's the matter with him? Steve asked, He said, or something. Say, right out, she took the body from Steve and called him in her own gloves, but the little blooper seemed to be no better. Dr. Harding walked over to look at the bird. And he ordered everybody into the or car. We have to get out of here fast. So hold the bird up close to your suit. The workers dropped their tools as if they were red hot and climbed into the car. Mr. Shannon helped so instead on, then jumped on himself. Dr. Harding crossed the electric button that was the signal to the operator in the main cabin to move the car. The car began to roll down the track. It picked up speed. As Dr. Harding kept pressing the button. We can gas Dr. Harding, Mr. Shannon asked for it. The chief engineer nodded. He said, the arrow like a hunting dog after a cent. Take a deep breath, everyone. Then hold it. Steve thought as long as we burst, but finally Dr. Harding let them take another deep breath. By the time they had taken one more, the car had reached the main cabin. As it rolled to a stop, Dr. Harding jumped down and right over to the car operator. Steve signed to our slide open and closed off the tunnel where they had come out. Then the little man gave a deep sigh and took off his black rimmed glasses to wipe them. Sue and Steve watched blood hopefully. He was standing more steadily on Sue's finger now. I think he'll be at all right. The chief engineer said, we sure owe blood a lot for warning us the way he did. Something must have happened to the warning machine. He was supposed to set off a siren. If it weren't for blood, we might have been overcome before we could have gone out of there. Mr. Shannon added, you're so right, Dr. Harding said, then we'll go back in there and gas masks to find the leak and see what's wrong with the warning machine. A hair plenic lucky Steve's side is spying still crippling from their narrow escape Sue kissed the budgie. You're a hero, but she told him and we love you. But blint lazily. Then as if to show that he was all right again, he's clocked rocking away.

As when the day gods loving beams awake, the lotus slumbering on the silver lake, so Brahma daint his glorious face to show, and poured sweet comfort on their looks of war. The near came the suppliant gods to pay, honor to him whose face turns every way. They bowed them low before the Lord of speech, and sat with truthful words his heart to reach. Glory to thee before the world was made, one single form thy majesty displayed. Next thou to body form the mystic three, dist-filled three persons, glory lured to thee. Unborn and unbegotten, from thy hand the fruitful seed rained down at thy command, from that small germ, or quickening water's throne, all things that move not, all that move have grown. Before thy triple form in are they bow, maker, preserver, and destroyer thou. Thou when a longing urged thee to create, thy single form in twain did separate. The sire, the mother, that made all things be, by their first union, where but parts of thee. From them the life that fills this earthly frame and fruitful nature self-renewing came. Thou countest not thy time by mortals light, with thee there is but one vast day and night. When brama slumber's fainting nature dies, when brama wakens all again arise. Creator of the world and uncreate, endless all things from thee therein the weight, before the world wasst thou. Each lord shall fall before thee, mightiest highest lord of all. Thysoft taught so thy known deep spirit knows, made by thysoft thy mighty form arose, into the same when all things have their end. Shall thy great self absorbed in thee descend? Lord, whom may hope thy essence to declare, firm yet as subtle as the yielding air, fixed all pervading pondress yet light, patent to all yet hidden from the sight. Thine are the sacred hymns which mortals raise, commencing ever with the word of praise, with three-toned chant the sacrifice to grace, and when it last in heaven a blissful place. Thay hail thee nature laboring to free the immortal soul from low humanity, hail thee the stranger spirit unimpressed, gazing on nature from thy lofty rest, father of fathers, God of gods are thou, creator highest hereof the vow, thou art the sacrifice and thou the priest, thou he that eateth thou the holy feast, thou art the knowledge which by thee is taught, the mighty thinker and the highest thought.

It has long been the belief of the authors that love making should be included in the regular curriculum of our schools. It seems to us the most important branch of co-education. How few of us know how to make love properly and how very few after making it know how to keep it. So much depends upon the kind of love which is made. There are no artificial methods of preserving love, but the best kind will keep forever. Few beginners know how to make the lasting kind, and many even of those with vast experience are still quite clumsy. The only way is to keep at it. We hope that this book will fill a long-felt want. Surely of all long-felt wants the want of love seems longest. It is for the earnest student of true love that we have compiled this Cyclopedia. All herford, John C.

In which it is proved that notwithstanding their names ending in us and is the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them. A short time ago, while making researches in the Royal Library for my history of Louis XIV, I stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of Mishr Dartanian, printed as were most of the works of that period in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a resident's more or less long in the Bastille at Amsterdam by Pierre Rouge. The title attracted me, I took them home with me with the permission of the Guardian and devoured them. It is not my intention here to enter into analysis of this curious work and I shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as a appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages. They will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master. And although these squibs may be for the most part, traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of Cabaretz, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII and of Austria. Rishilu, Messe Han and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of Mishr Antquitil. But it is well known what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers. Now, while admiring as others doubtless will admire, the details we have to relate are main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought. D'Artagnan relates that on his first visit to Mishr to Treville, Captain of the King's Muscatiers. He met in the anti-Chamber III young men, serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received, bearing the names of Athos, Porthos, and Erroneous. We must confess these three strange names struck us. And it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonims under which D'Artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which, from Caprice, just content or want to fortune, they had dawned the simple muscatiers uniform. From that moment, we had no rest until we could find some trace and contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly awakened our curiosity. The catalog alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter, which although it might be very instructive, would certainly afford our readers but little amusement. It will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which discouraged by so many fruitless investigations we were about to abandon our search, we had length found, guided by the councils of our illustrious friend, Paul Hanperi, a manuscript in Folio, endorsed 477-2 or 4773. We do not recollect which, having poor title, memoirs of the Comptile affair, touching some events which passed in France toward the end of the reign of King Louis XIII and the commencement of the reign of King Louis XIV. It may easily be imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the 20th page the name of Athos, at the 27th the name of Porthos, and at the 31st the name of Aramis. The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical sciences carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous. We hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday, with the pack of others at the doors of the Academy to inscription a belletta. If we should not succeed a very probable thing by the buy, in gaining admission to the Academy Francis with our own proper pack. This permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted which can tell us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters. Now this is the first part of the precious manuscript which we offer to our readers restoring it to the title which belongs to it and entering into an engagement that if of which we have no doubt this first part should obtain the success it merits we will publish the second immediately. In the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comp to la fair, the pleasure or the on we he may experience.

He walked among the trial men in a suit of Shabby Gray. A creaker cab was on his head, and his steps seemed light and gay, but I never saw a man who looked so wastefully at the day. I never saw a man who looked with such a wishful eye, upon that little tent of blue, which prisoners called the sky, and at every drifting clouded wind with sales of silver by, I walked with other souls in pain, within another ring and was wondering if the man had done a great or little thing, when a voice behind me whispered low that fellows got to swing. Dear Christ, the very present walls, saw on the seam to read and the sky above my head became like a cask of scorching steel, and thou I was a soul in pain my pain I could not feel. I only knew what haunted thought, quick and his step, and why he looked upon the garrish day, with such a wishful eye, the man had killed the thing he loved and so he had to die. Yet each man kills the thing he loves, by each let they speak hurt. Some do it with a bit or look, some with a flattering ward, the coward does it with a kiss, the brave men with a sword, some kill their love when they are young and some when they are old, some in strangle with the hands of lust, some with the hands of gold. The kindest use and knife because the dead so soon grow cold, some love too little, some too long, some sell another spy, some do that they'd with many tears and some without a spy, for each man kills the thing he loves, yet each man does not die. He does not die a death of shame on a day of dark disgrace, nor have a news about his neck, nor a cloth upon his face, nor drop feet foremost through the floor into an empty place. He does not sit with silent men who watch him night and day, who watch him when he tries to weave and when he tries to prey, who watch him less himself should drop the prison of its prey. He does not wake a dawn to see, dread figure throng his room, the shearing chaplain robbed, in white, the sheriff's turn with gloom, and the governor only shiny black with a yellow face of doom. He does not rise in pettiest haste to put on convict clothes, while some of his mouth knocker boats and noels, each new and nerf twitched pose, fingering a watch whose little thick are like horrible hammer blows. He does not know that sickening thirst that sands once throats before the hangman with his gardeners' gloves, sleeps through the padded door and bongs one with three leather and thongs, that the throats may thirst no more, he does not bend his head to here, the burial of his red, nor while the terror of his soul tells him he is not that crosses on coffinous him moves into the hideous shed. It does not stare upon the air through a little roof of glass, it does not prey with lips of prey for his agony to pass, nor feel upon his shuddering cheek the keys of sea of us. Six weeks or guardsman walked the yard in a suit of shabby grey, his cricket cab was on his head and his steps seemed like a gay, but I never saw a man who looked so wistfully at the day. I never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye, upon the little turns of blue which prisoners called the sky, and at every wandering cloud that trailed its ray world fleeces by. He did not ring his hands as do those with less men who dare to try to rear the chenclink hope in the cave of black despair, he only looked upon the sun and drank the morning air. He did not ring his hands nor we, nor did he pee or pine, but he drank the air as though it held some helpful anodine. We'd open mouths he drank the sun as though it had been wine, and I and all the souls in pain who tram the other ring. For God if we ourselves had done a great little thing and watched with gays of Dalmat's the man who had to swing, and a strange it was to see him pass with a steps all out and gay, and a strange it was to see him look so wistfully at the day, and a strange it was to think that he had such a debt to pay. For O'K'n'L'M have pleasant leaves that in the springtime shoot, but green to seize the gallows tree with its other bit and roots, and green or dry a man must die before it bears its roots. The lofty as place is that seat of grace, for which old Lordlings try, but who would stand in hemp and bend upon a scaffold high and through a murderous color take, his last look at the sky. It is sweet to dance to violence when love and life are fair, to dance to flutes, to dance to lutes is delicate and rare, but it is not sweet with nimble feet to dance upon the air, so with curious eyes and six or miles we washed him day by day, and wanderd if each one of us would end the self-some way for none can tell to what red hell he sightless soul may stray, at last the dead man walked no more, amongst the trail-yel man, and I knew that he was standing up in the black duck's dreadful pen, and that never would I see his face in God's sweet world again, like two doomed ships that passed in stone we had crossed each other's way, but we made no sign, we said no word, we had no word to say, for we did not meet in the holy night, but in the shape full day, a prison wall was round us both, the outcast man where we, the world had thrust us from his heart, and God from out his care, and the iron jean that waits for sin had caught us in his snare, three, in that of the art the stones are hard and the dripping wall is high, so it was there he took the air beneath the lead and sky, and by each side the water walked for here the man might die, or else he said with those who watched his anguish night and day, who watched him when he rose to weave and when he crouched to pray, who watched him less himself should rub their scaffold of his prey, the governor was strong upon the regulations act, the doctor said that death was but a scientific fact, and twice a day the chaplain called and left the little tract, and twice a day his smoke his pipe and drank his quattabir, his soul was resolute and held, no hiding planes for fear, he often said that he was glad the hangman's hands were near, and while he said so strange thing, no water dare to ask, for he to whom a watchers do misgivin as his task, must set a lock upon his lips and make his face a mask, or else he might be moved and try to comfort or to console, and what should human pity do pent up in murderous hold, what world of grace in such a place could help a brother so, with loud and swing around the ring, with short the fools parade, we did not care, we knew we were the dead with zone regained, and shaven head and feet of lead make him marry masquerade, we tore the tarry ropes to shreds, with blunt and bleeding names, we robbed those and scrubbed of those and cleaned the shining rays, and rank by rank we soaked the plank and clattered with the pays, we sued the sacks, we broke the stones, we turned the dust at real, we banged the tins and bowled the hymns and swatted on the meal, but in the heart of every man terror was lying still, so still it laid that every day crowd black a weed cocked wave, and we forgot the bitter lutt that waits for full and navel till once as we trimmed in from work, we passed an open grave, with yawning mouths the yellow hole, gaped for a living thing, the very mud cried out for blood, to the thirsty asphalt rain, and we knew that air one dawn grew fair, some prisoner had to swing, riding we went with soling tent on death and dread and doom, the hangman with his little bag went shuffling through the gloom, and each man trembled as he crept into his number two, that night the empty corridors were full of forms of fear, and up and down the iron towns still fit we could not hear, and through the bars that hide the stars white face the same to peer, he lay as one who lies and dreams in a pleasant metal and, the watcher washed him as his left and could not understand how one could sleep so sweet asleep, with a hangman close at hand, and there is no sleep when men must deweep, who never yet have wept, so we the fool the fraud the navel, the thenless we do kept, and through which rain on hands of pain and others terror crept, alas it is a fearful thing, to feel another's guilt, for right within the sword of same peers to each pose and held, and as molten lead were the tears we shed, for the blood we had not spailed, the waters with their shoes of belt, crept by each padlocked door, and peat and saw with eyes of our, graffigers on the floor, and wandered why men knilled to pray, whenever prayed before, all through the night we knelt and prayed, mad mourners of the corpse, the troubled blooms of midnight where the plumes upon a hears, and bitter wine upon a sponge was the saver of remorse. The cock-ruw, the red cock-ruw, but never came that day, and crook at shape of terror clouted, in the corners where we lay, and each evil-aspirated walks by night before us seemed to play. They glided past, they glided past, like travelers through a mist, they mocked the moon in a rickadoon of delicate turn and twist, and with formal pace and low thumb-grace the phantoms kept their triast. We mop and mop, we saw them go, slim shadows hand in hand, about about engosely routed their trot, a sad aband, and the damned grotesque, made arabesque, locked the wind upon the sand. With the perverts of marionettes, they trapped on point a tread, but with flutes of fear they filled the ear as they grizzly massed their lead, and loudly sang, and loudly sang, for they sang, to wake the dead. Ah, how they cried, the world is wide, but fattered limbs go lame, and one so twice to throw the dice is a gentle manly game, but he does not win, who plays with scene, in the secret house of shame. No things of earth is unticksware, that froliced with such plea, to men whose lives were held in gives, and whose feet might not go free, are wounds of Christ, they were living things, most terrible to see. Around, around, they waltz and wound, some wielding smirking pairs, with a mincing step of demirap, some sightled up the stairs, and with saddled sneer and found in the leary, which helped us at our prayers, the morning wind began to moan, while the stilled night went on, throw its giants loomed the web of gloom, creptial each thread was spun, and as we prayed, we grew afraid of the justice of the sun. The morning wind went wandering round, the weeping prison wall, till like a wheel of turning still we fell the miniscroud, o morning wind, what had we done to have such a sense call? At last I saw the shadowed bars like a lad is rotting lead, move right across the white washed wall that faced my tree planked bed, and I knew that summer in the wall got dreadful done was red, at six o'clock we cleaned ourselves at seven o'clock still, but the salt and swing of mighty wing, the prison seemed to feel, for the lord of death with icy breath had entered in to kill, he did not pass in purple pump, no right among white-stit, three yards of cord and sliding board are all the gallows need, so with robe of shame the hero came to do the secret deed, we were as men who threw a fan a filthy darkness grope, with it not there to breathe a prayer or give her anguish scope, something was dead in each of us and what was dead was hope, for men's grim justice goes his way and will not swear aside, it slays the wee, it slays the strong, it has a deadly stride, with iron healed in the states the strong, the monstrous parasite, we waited for the stroke of eight, each tongue was thick with perched, for the stroke of eight is the stroke of fate that makes a man a cursed, and fate will use a running news for the best men and the worst, we had no other thing to do, save to wait for the sign to come, so like things of stone in a valley lawn quiet we sat and dumb, but each man's heart, bit thick and quick, like a madman on a drum, with sudden shock the prison clocks smote on the shearing air and from all the Jane rose up a veil of impotent despair, like the sound that frightened Marsha's hear, from a leaper in his lair, and as one sees most fearful things in the crystal of a dream, we saw the greasy, hemp and rope hooked to the blackened beam and heard the prior the hangman's snare strangled into a scream, an old a wow that moved him so that he gave that bitter cry, and the water grits and the bloody swaths none knew so well as I, for he who lived more lives than one, more deaths than one must die, for. There is no chapel on the day, on which they hang a man, the chaplains heart is far too sick, or his face is far too man, or there is that return in his eyes which none should look upon, so they kept us close till night unknown, and then they rang the bell, and the waters with their jingle and keys opened each listening cell, and down the iron stair we tramped each from his separate hell, out into God's sweeter we went, but not in wanted way, for this man's face was white with fear, and that man's face was gray, and I never saw that man who looked so wistfully at the day. I never saw that man who looked with such a wishful eye upon that little tent of blue we prisoners called the sky, and the devilly careless cloud that passed in happy freedom by, and there's where those amongst us all who walked with downcast head, and knew that had each God his due they should have died instead, he had but killed the thing that lived, why stay had killed the dead. For he who sends a second time, Vexet that soul to pain, and draws it from his spotted shroud, and makes it bleed again, and makes it lead great gouts of blood and makes it bleed in vain, like a foreclown in monster scarred, with crooked arrows start, silently we went round and round this leap re-assault yard, silently we went round and round, and no moon spoke a word. Silent we went round and round and through each hollowed mind, the memory of dreadful things rushed like a dreadful wind, and horror stalked before each man, and terror crept behind, the waters started up and down and capped their higher the fruits, their uniforms were speak and spent, and they were their Sunday suits, and we knew the work they had been at by the quick-lime under boots, for where a grave had opened wide, there was no grave at all, on the stretch of modern sand by the hideous prison wall, and a little heap of burning alive that the man should have his paw, for he has a paw, this stretch of man, such as view man can claim, deep down below a prison yard, naked for greater shame, he lies with fetters on each foot, lapped in a sheet of flame, and all the while, the burning lime, its flesh and bone away, it eats the brittle bone by night, and the soft flesh by the day, it eats the flesh and bones by turns, but it eats the heart, all way. For three long years they will not sell or root for seeding there. For three long years they undressed spot will stride be and bear, and look upon the wandering sky with unreproachful stare, they think a murder's heart would taint each simple seed they saw, it is not true, God's kind years is kindly our dan men know, and the red rose would but blow more red the white rose wider below, out of his mouth a red red rose, out of his heart a white, for who can say, by what strange way Christ brings his will to light, since the bad and stuff the pilgrim bore loomed in the great pop side, but neither milk white rose no red me bloom in prison air, the shard the pebble that flints are what they give us there, for flowers have been known to heal the common man's despair, so never will wine red rose or white, petal by petal fall, and at the stretch of modern sand that lies by the hideous prison vow, to tell the men who trample the yard that gods undied for all, yet though the hideous prison vow still hems him round and round, and a spritman not walk by night that is with feathers bound, and a spritman not weep that lies in such an holy ground, he is at peace, this rich man, at peace or will be soon, there is nothing to make him mad, nor does terror walk at noon, for the lamplest earth in which he lies has neither son nor moon, they hanged him as a beast his hand, they did not even tall, a rukoyem that might have brought rest to his start-up soil, but hardly they took him out and hit him in a hole, they stripped him off his canvas clothes and gamed him to the flies, they mocked the soil and purple throat and the stark and staring eyes, and with laughter loud they heaped the shroud in which their convict lies, the chaplain would not kneel or pray while his dishonor grave, nor market with that blessed cross that Christ for sinners gave, because the man was one of those whom Christ came down to save, yet all is well he has but passed to lives upon that poor, an adent years will feel for him, pity is long broken and for his mourners will be outcastman, and outcasts always more. 5. I know not whether or loss be right or whether loves be wrong, all that we know, who lying jail is that the wall is strong, and that each day is like a year, a year whose days are long. But this I know that every law that men have made for men, since first men took his brother's life and the sad world began, but the strada weed and saved the shaft with the most evil fan, these two I know and why is it where if each could know the same, that every prison that men built is built with bricks of shame, and bound with bars less Christ should see how men their brothers' mane, with bars de Blair de Gracie's moon and blind the good list on, and they do well to hide their hail for in their things are done, that son of God, nor son of men, ever should look upon. The wireless deeds like poison weeds, bloom well in prison air, it is only while this good in men that weighs and withers their, pale English keeps the heavy gates and the water is despair. For they starve the little frightened child till it weeps both night and day, and discourage the weak and fluggled the pool and jiped the old and gray, and some grow mad and old grow bad and none award me say. Each narosel in which we dwell is foul and dark that rain, and the fetid breast of living deaths choked up each grated screen, and old but lost this turn to dust in humanity's machine. The brackish water that we drink creeps with a little some slime, and the bitter bread, dayway in scales is full of chalk and lime, and sleep will not lie down what walks, wide-eyed, and cries to time. But the lean hunger and green thirst, like as with other fight, we have little care of prison fair. For what choosing kills outright is that every stone will leave by day becomes once hard by night. With midnight always in one's heart, in twilight in one's cell, we turn the crank or tear the rope each in his separate hell, and the silence is more awful far than the sound of a brazen bull, and never a human voice comes near to speak a gentle word. And the eye that watches through the door is pithilis and hard, and by all for God we rot and rot with soul and body-mart, and thus we rust-lifed iron chain degraded and alone, and some and curse on some and weep, and some and make no more. But God's eternal laws are kind and break the hearts of stone. And every human heart that breaks in prison's cell or yard, is as that broken box that gave its treasure to the Lord, and filled the unclean lepros house with the scent of costess nerd, oh happy day day whose hearts can break and peace of pardon win. How else may men make straight his then and clean his soul from sin? How else but through a broken heart may Lord cries in train? And he of the soul and purple throat and the stark and staring eyes, waits for the holy hands that took the thief to paradise, and a broken and a contrite heart their blood will not despise. The man in red who reads the law gave him three weeks of life, three little weeks in which to heal his soul of his soul's drive, and cleans from every blood of blood the hand that held the knife, and with tears of blood he cleans the hand, the hand that held the steal, for only blood can wipe out blood and only tears can heal, and the crimson stain that was obtained became Christ's no-whites see. 6. In reading jail by reading town, there is a pit of shame, and in it lies a red-chad man eaten by teeth of blame, in burning winding sheetely lies and his grave has got no name, and there to Christ called forst the dead in silence let him lie, no need to waste the foolish chair, or heave to be in this eye, the man had killed the thing he loved, and so he had to die. An old man killed the thing they loved, by all that this be heard, some do it with a bitter look, some with a flattering word, the coward does it with a case, the brave man, with a sword, and of poem, this recording is in the public domain.",Poetry,English,03:07:59,LibriVox Volunteers,[],"['Shabby Gray', 'moon', 'Marsha', 'keys', 'knelt', 'Jane', 'Vexet', 'shabby grey', ""de Blair de Gracie's""]",['poem'],[],0,0,0,0,1,1,0
A Texas Matchmaker,Andy Adams,187605,,"April 4, 2018",[],0,"revox.org. Recording by Richard Kilmer, San Antonio, Texas. A Texas Smash Maker by Andy Adams. Chapter 1. Lance Love Lace. When I first found employment with Lance Love Lace, a Texas common, I had not yet attained my majority. While he was over 60, though not a native of Texas, Uncle Lance, was entitled to be classed amongst its pioneers. His parents have an emigrated from Tennessee, along with a party of Stephen F. Austin's colonists in 1821. The colony, with which his people reached the state, landed at Quintana, at the mouth of the Brassos River, and shared the various hardships that befell all the early Texas settlers. Moving inland later to a more healthy locality. Thus the education of young love Lace was one of privation. Like other boys and pioneer families, he became in turn a heur of wood, or a drawer of water. As the necessities of the household required, in reclaiming the wilderness. When Austin hoisted the newborn, long-star flag, and called upon the sturdy pioneers to defend it, the adventurers settlers came from every quarter of a territory. And among the first to respond to the call of arms, was young Lance's love Lace. After San Hesanto, when the fighting was over, and the victory won, he laid down his arms and returned the ranching with the same zeal and energy. The first legislature assembled, voted, to those who bore arms in behalf of the new Republic, lands, and payment for their services. With his land script for his pay, young love Lace, and company with others, set out for the territory lined south of the new races. They were a band of daring spirits. The country was primitive and fascinated them, and they remained. Some settled on the free of river, though the majority crossed the noaces, many going as far south as the real grand. The country was as large as the men were daring, and there was elbow room for all and to spare. Lance loved Lace, located a ranch, a few miles south of the noaces river, and from the queen of the dubs in the incident, named it Lace Palomas. When I first settled here in 1838, said Uncle Lance to me one morning, as we rode out across the range, my nearest neighbor lived 40 miles up the river at Fort Eul. Of course, they were some Mexican families nearer, north on the free of, but they don't count. Say Tom, but she was a pretty country then. Why from those hills younger, any morning you could see a thousand antelope in a band, going into the river to drink, and wild turkeys? Well, the first few years we lived here, whole flocks rusted every night, in that farther point of the incident. And in the winter, these parries were just flooded with geese and brant. If you want it venison, all you had to do was to ride through those mosquitos that gets north of the river to jump a hundred deer in a morning's ride, oh I tell you, she was a land of plenty. The pioneers of Texas belonged to a day and generation, which is almost gone. If strong arms and daring spirits were required to conquer the wilderness, nature seemed generous in the supply. For nearly all were stalwart types of the inland Viking. This love lace, when I first met him, would have passed for a man in middle life. Over six feet in height, with a rugged constitution, he little felt his three-score years, having spent his entire lifetime in the outdoor occupation of a ranch man. Living on the wild game of the country, sleeping on the ground by a campfire, when his work required it, has much at home in the saddle as by his ranch fireside. He was a romantic type of a strenuous pioneer. He was a man of simple tastes, true has tested steel in his friendships, with a simple honest mind which followed truth and right has unarriently has gravitation. In his domestic affairs however, he was unfortunate. For a year after located at Las Palomas, he had returned to his former home on the Colorado River, where he had married Mary Brian, also, of the family of Austin colonists. Hopefully unhappy they returned to their new home on the new aces. But before the first anniversary of their wedding day arrived, sheep, with her first born, was laid in the same grave. But grief does not kill, and the young husband borers lost, has brave men do, in living out there a lot of day. But to the hour of his death, the memory of Mary Brian, meddled him into a child. And when unoccupied, with every recurring thought of her, or the mere mention of her name, he would fall into deep reverie, lasting sometimes for hours. Although he contracted two marriages afterward, they were simply marriages of convenience, to which after their termination he frequently referred flippantly, sometimes with the reverence, for they were unhappy alliances. On my arrival at Las Palomas, the only white woman on the ranch was Miss Jane, a spinster sister of its owner, and 20 years his junior. After his third bitter experience in the lottery of Matt Ramoney, evidently, he gave up hope and induced his sister to come out and preside as the mistress of Las Palomas. She was not tall like her brother, but rather plump for her 40 years. Shed large gray eyes with long black eyelashes, and she had a trick of looking out from under them, which was both provoking and disconcerting. And no doubt, many of it, myer, had been deceived by those same rogueish laughing eyes. Every man, Mexican and child on the ranch, was the devoted courtier of Miss Jane. For she was a lovable woman, and in spite of her isolated life, and the constant playgings of her brother on being a spinster, she fit it neatly into our pastoral life. It was these teasing of her brother that gave me my first inkling that the old rancher was a wildly matchmaker, though he religiously denied every such accusation. With a remarkable complacency, Jane Lovelay smet, and parade her tormentor, but her brother never tired of his hobby, while there was a third person to listen. Though an unlettered man, last love-lays, had been a close observer of humanity. The big book of life had been always opened before him, and he had profited from its pages. With my advent at Las Palomas, there were less than half a dozen books on the ranch, among them, a copy of Brett Hart's poems and a large Bible. That book alone, said he to several of us one chilly evening, has we sat around the open fireplace, is the greatest treaties on humanity ever written. Go with me today in any city, in any country in Christendom, and I'll show you a man, walk up the steps of his church on Sunday, who thanks God that he's better than his neighbor. But you need and go so far if you don't want to, I reckon, if I could see myself, I might show symptoms of it occasionally. This here, thanks God, daily, that she is better than that barn's girl who cut her out of Amis Alexander. Now don't you deny it, for you know it's gospel truth, and that book is reliable on lots of other things. Take marriage, for instance. It is just as natural for men and women to mate at the proper time, as it is for steer as the shed in the spring. But there's no necessity of making all this fuss about it. The Bible weighed discounts all these modern methods. He took unto himself a wife, is the way it describes such events. But now such an occurrence has to be announced once in advance, and after the wedding is over, in less than a year sometimes, Theraglan the stake off and get the bomb dissolved in some divorce court like I did with my second wife. All of us about to ranch, including Miss Jane, knew that the old rancher else views on matrimony, could be obtained by leading up to the question, or differing, has occasion required. So just to hear him talk on his favorite theme, I said, Uncle Lance, you must recollect this is a different generation. Now I've read books. So if I, but it's different in real life, now in those novels you have read, the poor devil is nearly worried the death for fear he'll not get her. Here's a hundred things happens. He's thrown off the scent one day and cuts it again the next and one evening. He's in a heaven of bliss and before the dance ends, a rival looms up and there's hell to pay, excuse me, says, but he gets certain the end. And that's the way it goes in the books. But getting down to actual cases, when the monies on the table and the game's rolling, it's as simple as picking a sire and a dam to raise a racehorse. When they're both willing, it don't require any expert to see it. But when I'd or a blind man can tell the symptoms, now, when any of you boys get into that fix, get it over with as soon as possible. From the drift of your remarks, said June the Weasvery innocently, why wouldn't it be a good idea to go back to the old method of letting the parents make the matches? Yes, it would be a good idea, how in the name of common sense could you expect young sapeds like you boys to understand anything about a woman? I know what I'm talking about. A single woman never shows her true colors, but conceals are imperfections. The average man is not to be blamed if he fails to see through her smiles and Sunday humor. Now I was 40 when I married the second time and 45 the last world. Looks like I'd had some little sense now, don't it, but I didn't. No I didn't have any more show than a snowball in, sis. Had you better retire? You're not interested in my talk to these boys. Well, if ever any of you want to get married, you have my consent. You better get my opinion under dimples when you do. Now, with my 60 odd years, I'm worth listening to. I could take a cool dispassionate view of a woman now and pick every good point about her, just as if she was a cow horse that I was buying for my own saddle. Ms. Jane, who had already tongue for repartais, took advantage of the first opportunity to remark. Do you know, brother, matrimony, is a subject that I always enjoy hearing discussed by such an Oracle as yourself? But did it never occur to you what an unjust thing it was of providence to reveal so much to your wisdom and conceal the same from us babes? It took some time for the gentle reproved to take effect, but Uncle Lance had an easy faculty for evading a question when it was contrary to his own views. Speaking of the wisdom of babes said he, reminds me of what Felix York, an old 36-comrade of mine once said. He had caught the gold fever in 49 and nothing would do, but he and some others must go to California. The party went up to Independence, Missouri, where they got into an overland immigrant train, bound for the land of gold. But it seems before a starting, Senator Benton, had made a speech in that town, and in which he made the prophecy that one day, there would be a railroad connecting the Missouri river with a pacific ocean. Felix told me this only a few years ago, but he said that all the teamsters made the prediction of by-word, when crossing some of the mountain ranges, the train halted to let the oxen blow, one bullwacker would say to another, well I'd like to seal Tom Benton, get his railroad over this mountain. And Felix told me this, he said, there's a railroad today, crosses those same mountain passes, over which we forty-nineers whacked our bulls, and to think I was a grown man, and had no more sense or foresight than a little baby bleak in its eyes in the sun. With years at Los Palmas, I learned to like the old ranch arrow. There was something of a strong primitive man about him, which compelled a youth of my years to listen to his counsel. His confidence in me was a compliment, which I appreciate to this day. When I had been in his employ hardly two years, an incident occurred, which, though only one of many similar acts cementing our long friendship, tested his trust. One morning, just as he was on the point of starting on horseback to the county seat, to pay his taxes, a Mexican arrived at the ranch and announced that he had seen a large band of Havalena on the border of the Shaperrell up the river. Uncle Lance had promised his taxes by a certain date, but he was a true sportsman and owned a fine pack of hounds, moreover, the pecory is a migratory animal and is not weighed upon the pleasure of the hunter. As I rode out from the corals to learn, what had brought the vicaros such as the old ranch Cheryl cried, here Tom, you'll have to go to the county seat. Buckle this money belt under your shirt, and if you lack enough gold to cover the taxes, you'll find silver here in my saddle bags. Blow the horn boys and get the guns, lay the way punch-o and say Tom, better leave the road after crossing the sordo. And strike through that miskeet country he called back, as he swung into a saddle and started, leaving me a 60 mile ride in his stead. His warning to leave the road after crossing the creek was timely. For a ranch man had been robbed by bandits on that road the month before. But I made the ride in safety before sunset, paying the taxes, amounting to over $1,000. During all of our acquaintance extending over a period of 20 years, Lance's love lace was a constant revelation to me, for he was original in all things. Knowing no precedent, he recognized none, which had not the approval of his own conscience. Where others were content to follow, he blazes on pathways in material to him, whether they were followed by others or even noticed. In his business relations and in his own way, he was exact himself and likewise exacting of others. Some there are who might criticize him, for an episode which occurred about four years after, by advent at lost palomas. Mr. Whitley both, a younger man, and a brother-in-law of the old rancher, by his first wife, rode into the ranch one evening evidently on important business. He was not a frequent caller, for he was also a ranch man, living about 40 miles north and west on the Freel River. But he was in the habit of bringing his family down to the noaces, about twice a year for a visit of, from ten days to two weeks, duration. But this time, though we had been expecting the family for some little time, he came alone, remained overnight, and at breakfast ordered his horse, as of expecting to return at once. The two ranch man were holding a conference in the sitting room. When a Mexican boy came to me at the courrals and said, I was wanted in the house. On my presenting myself, my employer said, Tom, I want you as a witness to a business transaction. I'm lending Whit here, a thousand dollars, and as we have never taken any notes between us, I merely want you as a witness. Go into my room, please, and bring out from under my bed, one of those largest bags of silver. The door was unlocked and there under the rancher's bed, discovered, or possibly a dozen sacks of silver. Finding one tag with a required amount, I brought it out and laid it on the table between the two men. But on my return, I noticed Uncle Lance had turned his chair from the table, and was gazing out of the window, apparently absorbed in thought. I saw at a glance that he was gazing into the past. When I'd become used to these reveries on his part, I had not been excused, and an embarrassed silence ensued. Which was only broken, as he looked over a shoulder and said, there it is Whit counted if you want to. But Mr. Booth knowing the oddities of Uncle Lance hesitated. Well, why look here, Lance? If you have any reason for not wanting to loan me this amount, why say so? There's the money Whit, take it if you want to. It'll pay for the hundred cows you are figuring on buying. But I was just thinking, can two men at our time in life would always been friends, afford to take the risk of letting a business transaction like this, possibly make a sentemies? You know I started poor here, and what I have made and saved is the work of my lifetime. You are welcome to the money, but if anything should happen that you didn't repay me, you know I wouldn't feel right towards you. It's probably my years that does it, but now I always look forward to the visits of your family and jean. And I always enjoy our visits at your ranch. I think we'd be too old fools to allow anything to break up those pleasant relations. Uncle Lance turned in his chair and looking into the downcast countenance of Mr. Booth continued. You know Whit that young as girl of yours reminds me of her aunt, my own married in a hundred ways. I just love to have your girls tear around this old ranch, and they seem to give me back certain glimpses of my youth that are priceless to an old man. That'll do Lance, Mr. Booth, rising and extending his hand. I don't want the money now. Your view on the matter is right, and our friendship is worth more than a thousand cattle to me.

Persuasion (version 7),Jane Austen,66382,1.0,"December 30, 2018",[],0," Recording by Judy Gynon, persuasion by Jane Austen, chapter 1. So Walter Elieita Kellinich Hall in Somersetshire was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the baron page. There he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distrust one. There his faculties were roused into admiration and respect. By contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patterns, there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century. And there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed. This was a page at which the favorite volume always opened. Elieita Kellinich Hall. Walter Elieit born March 1, 1760, married July 15, 1784. Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevens and Esquire, South Park, in the county of Gloster. By which Lady who died, 1800, he has issue of Elizabeth born June 1, 1785, and born August 9, 1787. A stillborn son, November 5, 1789. Mary born November 20, 1791. Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands, but Sir Walter had improved it by adding for the information of himself and his family these words. After the date of Mary's birth, married, December 16, 1810, Charles son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esquire of Upper Cross, in the county of Somerset, and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife. Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family and the usual terms. How had it been for settled in Cheshire? How mentioned in Doug Dale serving the office of high share, representing a burl and three successive parlaments, exertions of loyalty and dignity of Verenette, in the first year Charles II. With all the Mary's and Elizabeth's they had married, forming altogether two handsome, do decimal pages, and concluding with the arms and motto, principal seat, Governor Nichol in the county of Somerset, and Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale, heir presumptive William Walter Elliott Esquire, great grandson of the second Sir Walter. Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliott's character, Vanity of person and of situation. He had been remarkably handsome in his youth, and at 54 was still a very fine man, few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did. There could the valid of any new made Lord be more delighted with the place he held in society. He considered the blessing of beauty and inferior only to the blessing of a barren to see. And the Sir Walter Elliott, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion. His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment. Since to them he must have owed a wife a very superior character to anything deserved by his own. Lady Elliott had been an excellent woman, sensible and admirable, whose judgment and conduct if they might be pardoned, the youthful and fatuation which made her lady Elliott, had never required indulgence afterwards. She had humored her softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real respect ability for 17 years, and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties, her friends and her children, who had attached her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on, to quit them. Three girls, the two eldest 16 and 14, was an awful legacy for a mother to be queen, an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceded silly father. She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her in the village of Killingwich. And on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliott mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles, and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters. This friend and Sir Walter did not marry, whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance. 13 years had passed away since Lady Elliott's death, and they were still near neighbors and intimate friends, and one remained a widow or the other a widow. That Lady Russell, a steady age and character and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again. Then when she does not, but Sir Walter is continuing in singleness requires explanation. Be it no one then that Sir Walter, like a good father, having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications, provided himself on remaining single for his dear daughter's sake. For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up anything, which he had not been very much tempted to do. Elizabeth had succeeded at 16 to all that was possible of her mother's rights and consequence, and being very handsome and very like himself, her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most happily. His two other children were a very inferior value. Mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming Mrs. Charles Musgrove, but Anne with the elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister, her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give away, she was only Anne. To Lady Russell, indeed she was a most dear and highly valued goddaughter, favorite and friend. Lady Russell loved them all, but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again. A few years before Anne Elliott had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early, and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own. There could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem. He had never indulged in much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in any other page of his favorite work. All the quality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an oak country family of respect to Billody and large fortune, and had therefore given all the honor and received none. Elizabeth would one day or other, Mary suitably. It sometimes happens that a woman is Hansenmer at 29, then she was at 10 years before, and generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost. It was so with Elizabeth, still the same Hansen Miss Elliott that she had begun to be 13 years ago, and Sir Walter might be excused, therefore in forgetting her age, or at least, be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever. Amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else, for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing, Anne Haggard, Mary Cors, every face in the neighborhood worsening, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him. Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment. 13 years had seen her mistress a killing it all, presiding in directing with a self-procession and decision, which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was. For 13 years had she been doing the honors and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading the way to the Shasin 4 and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country. 13 winters revolving frost had seen her opening every ball of credit, which a scanty neighborhood afforded, and 13 springs show in their blossoms as she traveled up to London with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world. She had the remembrance of all this. She had the consciousness of being nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions. She was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger and whatever choice to be certain of being properly solicited by Baronette blood within the next 12 month or two, then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth. But now she liked it not, always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow, but that of a younger sister made the book an evil. And more than once, when her father had left it open on the table near her, she had closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away. She had had a disappointment, or over, which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of, the air presumptive, the very William Walter Elliott Esquire, whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her. She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother, the future Baronette, meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should. He had not been known to them as a boy, but soon after Lady Elliott's death, Sir Walter has sought the acquaintance, and though his overshears had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth, and in one of their spring excursions to London, when a misdeeds was in her first bloom, Mr. Elliott had been forced into the introduction. He was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law, and a misdeeds found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favor was confirmed. He was invited to Kelly Nitch Hall, he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year, but he never came. The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable, again encouraged and invited and expected, and again he did not come. And the next tidings were that he was married, instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the air of the house of Elliott, he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth. So Walter had resented it, as he headed at the house he felt that he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand. For they must have been seen together, he observed, once a tatter-shalls and twice in the lobby of the house of Commons. His disapporation was expressed, but apparently very little regarded. Mr. Elliott had attempted no apology, and shown himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as their wife, as their Walter considered him unworthy of it, all acquaintance between them had ceased. This very awkward history of Mr. Elliott was still after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliott's oldest daughter. There was not a baronette from A to Z whom her feelings could have been willingly acknowledged as an equal. Yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time the summer of 1814, wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not embed him to be worth thinking of again. The disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetrated by offspring, have been, got over, had he not done worse, but he had, as by the customary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed spoken most just respectively of them all, most slightly and contemptuously of the very bloody belong to, and the honors which were here after to be his own, this could not be pardoned. Such were Elizabeth Elliott's sentiments and sensations such the cares to ally, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life, such the feelings to give interest to a long, unaventful residence in one country circle, to fill the vacancies, which there were no habits of utility abroad, though talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy. But now another occupation and solicitude of mine was beginning to be added to these, her father was growing distressed for money, she knew that when he now took up the baron torch, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints a Mr. Shepherd his agent from his thoughts, the Kelenich property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required in its processor. Well, Lady Elliott lived, there had been method moderation and economy which had just capped him within his income, but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it, it had not been possible for him to spend less, he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliott was empirically called on to do, but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially from his daughter. He had given her some hints of it the last spring and town, he had gone so far, even as to say, can we retrench? Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench? And a list of it too, do her justice, had in the first order of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishings in the drawing room, to which expedience she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom. But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards, Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy, she felt herself ill-used and unfortunate as did her father, and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses, without compromising their dignity or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be born. There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of, but had ever ever been a leanable, it would have made no difference. He had condescended to more visas far as he had the power, but he would never condescend to sell. No, he would never disgrace his name so far. The Kelli Nesca State should be transmitted whole and entire as he had received it. There are two confidential friends, Mr. Shepherd, who lived in the neighboring market town, and Lady Russell were called to advise them, and both father and daughter seem to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassment, and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride.

Paradise Lost Every age has its peculiar folly, some scheme, project, or fantasy into which it plunges. Spurred on either by the love of gain, the necessity of excitement, or the mere force of imitation. Failing in these, it has some madness to which it is goded by political or religious causes or both combined. Every one of these causes influenced the Crusades and conspired to render them the most extraordinary instance upon record of the extent to which popular enthusiasm can be carried. History in her solemn page informs us that the Crusaders were but ignorant and savage men, that their motives were those of bigotry unmitigated, and that their pathway was one of blood in tears. Romance, on the other hand, dilates upon their piety and heroism, and portrays in her most glowing and impassioned hues, their virtue and magnanimity, the imperishable honor they acquired for themselves, and the great services they rendered to Christianity. In the following pages, we shall ransack the stores of both. To discover the true spirit that animated the Motley multitude who took up arms in the service of the cross, leaving history to vouch for facts, but not sustaining the aid of contemporary poetry and romance, to throw light upon feelings, motives, and opinions. In order to understand thoroughly the state of public feeling in Europe at the time when Peter the Hermit preached the Holy War, it will be necessary to go back for many years and tearier to that event. We must make acquaintance with the pilgrims of the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries, and learn the tales they told of the dangers they had passed and the wonders they had seen. Pilgrimages to the Holy Land seem at first to have been undertaken by converted Jews, and by Christian devotees of lively imagination, pining with a natural curiosity to visit the scenes which of all others were most interesting in their eyes. The pious and the impious alike flocked to Jerusalem. The one class to feast their sights on the scenes hallowed by the life and sufferings of their Lord, and the other because it soon became a generally received opinion that such a pilgrimage was sufficient to rub off the long score of sins however atrocious. Another and very numerous class of pilgrims were the idol and roving, who visited Palestine then as the moderns visit Italy or Switzerland now because it was the fashion, and because they might please their vanity by retailing on their return the adventures they had met with. But the really pious formed the great majority. Every year their numbers increased until at last they became so numerous as to be called the armies of the Lord. Full of enthusiasm they set the dangers and difficulties of the way at defiance and lingered with holy rapture on every scene described by the evangelists. To them it was bliss indeed to drink the clear waters of the Jordan or be baptized in the same stream where John had baptized the Savior. They wandered with awe and pleasure in the perl use of the temple on the solemn mount of olives or the awful calvary where a God had bled for sinful men. To these pilgrims every object was precious, relics were eagerly sought after, flaggons of water from Jordan or paniers of mold from the hill of the crucifixion or brought home and sold at extravagant prices to churches and monasteries. More apocryphal relics such as the wood of the true cross, the tears of the virgin Mary, the hymns of her garments, the toenails and hair of the apostles, even the tents that Paul had helped to manufacture were exhibited for sale by the naivish in Palestine and brought back to Europe with wondrous cost and care. A grove of a hundred oaks would not have furnished all the wood, sold and little morsels as remnants of the true cross and the tears of Mary if collected together would have filled a sister. For upwards of 200 years the pilgrims met with no impediment in Palestine, the enlightened haroon al-Rashid and his more immediate successors encouraged the stream which brought so much wealth into Syria and treated the way fairers with the utmost courtesy. The race of Fatimae Caliphs, who although in other respects as tolerant were more distressed for money or more unscrupulous and obtaining it than their predecessors of the house of a bass, imposed attacks of a beasant for each pilgrim that entered Jerusalem. This was a serious hardship upon the poorer sort who had begged their weary way across Europe and arrived at the borne of all their hopes without a coin. A great outcry was immediately raised but still the tax was rigorously levied. The pilgrims unable to pay were compelled to remain at the gates of the Holy City until some rich devotee arriving in his train paid the tax and let them in. Number of Normandy, father of William the Conqueror, who in common with many other nobles of the highest rank undertook the pilgrimage, found on his arrival scores of pilgrims at the gate anxiously expecting his coming to pay the tax for them. Upon no occasion was such a boon refused. The sums drawn from the source were a mine of wealth to the Muslim governors of Palestine, imposed as the tax had been at a time when pilgrimages had become more numerous than ever. A strange idea had taken possession of the popular mind at the close of the 10th and commencement of the 11th century. It was universally believed that the end of the world was at hand, that the thousand years of the apocalypse were near completion, and that Jesus Christ would descend upon Jerusalem to judgment kind. All Christendom was in commotion. A panic terror seized upon the weak, the credulous and the guilty, who in those days formed more than 1920 of the population. For saking their homes, kindred, and occupation, they crowded to Jerusalem to await the coming of the Lord, lightened as they imagined of a load of sin by their weary pilgrimage. To increase the panic, the stars were observed to fall from heaven, earthquakes, to shake the land, and violent hurricanes to blow down the forests. All of these, and more especially the meteoric phenomena, were looked upon as the four runners of the approaching judgments. Not a meteor shot a thwart the horizon that did not fill a district with alarm, and send away to Jerusalem a score of pilgrims, with staff in hand and wallet on their back, praying as they went for the remission of their sins. Then women and even children trudged in droves to the holy city, an expectation of the day when the heavens would open, and the sun of God descend in his glory. This extraordinary delusion, while it augmented the numbers, increased also the hardships of the pilgrims. Beggers became so numerous on all the highways between the west of Europe and Constantinople that the monks, the great alms givers upon these occasions, would have brought starvation within sight of their own doors if they had not economized their resources and left the devotees to shift for themselves as they could. Hundreds of them were glad to subsist upon the berries that ripened by the road, who before this great flux might have shared the bread and flesh of the monasteries. But this was not the greatest of their difficulties. On their arrival in Jerusalem, they found that a stoner race had obtained possession of the holy land. The calis of Baghdad had been succeeded by the harsh Turks of the race of Seljuq, who looked upon the pilgrims with contempt and aversion. The Turks of the 11th century were more ferocious and less scrupulous than the sericins of the 10th. They were annoyed at the immense number of pilgrims who overran the country, and still more so because they should know intention of quitting it. The hourly expectation of the last judgment kept them waiting, and the Turks apprehensive of being at last driven from the soil by the swarms that were still arriving, heaped up difficulties in their way. Persecution of every kind awaited them. They were plundered, and beaten with stripes, and captains suspends for months at the gates of Jerusalem, unable to pay the golden peasant that was to procure them admission. In the first epidemic terror of the day of judgment began to subside, a few pilgrims ventured to return to Europe, their hearts big with indignation at the insults they had suffered. Everywhere as they passed, they were related to a sympathizing auditory the wrongs of Christendom. Strange to say, even these recitals increased the mania for pilgrimage. The greater the dangers of the way, the ferocious chance that sins of deep die would be a toned for. difficulty in suffering only heightened the merit, and fresh hordes issued from every town in village to win favor in the sight of heaven by a visit to the Holy Sepulchur. Thus did things continue during the whole of the 11th century. The train that was too explode so fearfully was now laid, and they're wanted but the hand to apply the torch. At last the man appeared on the scene. Like all who had ever achieved so great and end, Peter the Hermit was exactly suited to the age. Neither behind it nor in advance of it, but he cute enough to penetrate its mystery air it was discovered by any other. enthusiastic, chivalrous, bigoted, and if not insane, not far removed from insanity, he was the very prototype of the time. True enthusiasm is always persevering in always eloquent, and these two qualities were united in no common degree in the person of this extraordinary preacher. He was a monk of amyenne, and air he assumed the hood and served as a soldier. He is represented of having been ill favored and low in stature, but with an eye of surpassing brightness and intelligence. Having been seized with the mania of the age he visited Jerusalem, and remained there till his blood boiled to see the cruel persecution heaped upon the devotees. On his return home, he shook the world by the eloquent story of their wrongs. Before entering into any further details of the marvelous results of his preaching, it will be advisable to cast a glance at the state of the mind of Europe, that we may understand all the better the causes of his success. First of all, there was the priesthood, which exercising as it did the most conspicuous influence upon the fortunes of society claims the largest share of attention. Religion was the ruling idea of that day, and the only civilizer capable of taming such wolves is then constituted the flock of the faithful. The clergy were all in all, and though they kept the popular mind in the most slavish subjection with regard to religious matters, they furnished it with the means of defense against all other oppression except their own. In the ecclesiastical ranks were concentrated all the true piety, all the learning, all the wisdom of the time, and as a natural consequence a great portion of power, which they vary wisdom perpetually and cited them to expand. The people knew nothing of kings and nobles except in the way of injuries inflicted. The first ruled for, or more properly speaking against, the barons, and the barons only existed to brave the power of the kings, or to trample with their iron heels upon the neck of prostrate democracy. The latter had no friend but the clergy, and these, though they necessarily instilled the superstition from which they themselves were not exempt, yet taught the cheering doctrine that all men were equal in the sight of heaven. Thus while feudalism told them they had no rights in this world, religion told them they had every right in the next. With this consolation, they were for the time contend. For political ideas had as yet taken no root. When the clergy, for other reasons, recommended the crusade, the people joined in it with enthusiasm. The subject of Palestine filled all minds. The pilgrims' tales of two centuries warmed every imagination. And when their friends, their guides, and their instructors, preached a war so much in accordance with their own prejudices and modes of thinking that enthusiasm rose into a frenzy. But while religion inspired the masses, another agent was at work upon the nobility. These were fierce and lawless, tainted with every vice, endowed with no virtue and redeemed by one good quality alone. That of courage. The only religion they felt was the religion of fear. That, and their overboiling turbulence alike, combined to guide them to the Holy Land. Most of them had sins enough to answer for. They lived with their hand against every man, and with no law but their own passions. They set ant defiance the secular power of the clergy. But their hearts quailed at the awful denunciations of the pulpit with regard to the life to come. War was the business, and the delight of their existence. And when they were promised remission of all their sins upon the easy condition of following their favorite bent, it is not to be wondered that they rushed with enthusiasm to the onslaught. It became as zealous in the service of the cross as the great majority of the people who were swayed by more purely religious motives. Fanaticism and the love of battle alike impaled them to the war. While the kings and princes of Europe still had another motive for encouraging their zeal. Policy opened their eyes to the great advantages which would accrue to themselves by the absence of so many restless and intriguing and bloodthirsty men whose insolence it required more than the small power of royalty to restrain within due bounds. Thus every motive was favorable to the crusades. Every class of society was alike incited to join or encourage the war. Kings and the clergy by policy, the nobles by turbulence and the love of domination, and the people by religious zeal and the concentrated enthusiasm of two centuries, skillfully directed by their only instructors. It was impalised on itself that Peter the Hermit first conceived the grand idea of rousing the powers of Christchendom to rescue the Christians of the East from the throldum of the Muslims and the sepulcher of Jesus from the rude hands of the infidel. The subject engrossed his whole mind. Even in the visions of the night he was full of it. One dream made such an impression upon him that he devoutly believed the Savior of the world himself appeared before him and promised him aid and protection in his holy undertaking. If his zeal had ever wavered before, this was sufficient to fix it forever. Peter, after he had performed all the penances and duties of his pilgrimage, demanded an interview with Simian, the patriarch of the Greek Church and Jerusalem. Though the latter was a heretic and Peter's eyes, yet he was still a Christian and felt as acutely as himself for the persecutions heaved by the Turks upon the followers of Jesus. The good prelet entered fully into his views and, in his suggestion, wrote letters to the Pope and to the most influential monarchs of Christendom, detailing the sorrows of the faithful and urging them to take up arms and their defiance. Peter was not a lagered in the work, taking an affectionate farewell of the patriarch he returned in all haste to Italy. Pope Urban II occupied the apostolic chair. It was at that time far from being an easy seat. His predecessor Gregory had bequeathed him a host of disputes with the Emperor Henry IV of Germany and he had converted Philip I to France and to an enemy by his strenuous opposition to an adult-risk connection formed by that monarch. So many dangers encompassed him that the Vatican was no secure abode and he had taken refuge in Apulia under the protection of the renown, Robé Aguiscar. Thither Peter appears to have followed him, though in what spot their meeting took place is not stated with any precision by ancient chronicles or modern historians. Urban received him most kindly, read with tears in his eyes the epistle from the patriarch simian and listen to the eloquent story of the hermit with an attention which shude how deeply he sympathized with the woes of the Christian church. And Thuziasm is contagious and the Pope appears to have caught it instantly from one whose zeal was so unbounded. Giving the hermit full powers he sent him abroad to preach the holy war to all the nations and potent tastes of Christendom. The hermit preached and countless thousands answered to his call. France, Germany and Italy started at his voice and prepared for the deliverance of Zion. One of the early historians of the Crusade, who was himself an eyewitness of the rapture of Europe, describes the potential appearance of the hermit at this time. He says that there appeared to be something of divine in everything which he said or did. The people so highly reverence to him that they plucked hairs from the mane of his muel that they might keep them as relics. While preaching he wore in general a woolen tunic with a dark colored mantle which fell down to his heels. His arms and feet were bare and he ate neither flesh nor bread, supporting himself chiefly upon fish and wine. He said out, says the chronicleer, from once I know not, but we saw him passing through the towns and villages, preaching everywhere, and the people surrounding him in crowds, loading him with offerings and celebrating his sanctity with such great praises that I never remember to have seen such honors bestowed upon anyone. Thus he went on. He retired, inflexible, and full of devotion, communicating his own madness to his hears until Europe was stirred from its very depths. While the hermit was appealing with such signal success to the people, the pope appealed with as much success to those who were to become the chiefs and leaders of the expedition. His first stamp was to call a council at Placencia, in the autumn of the year 1095. Here in the assembly of the clergy, the pope debated the grand scheme, and gave audience to emissaries who had been sent from Constantinople by the Emperor of the East, to detail the progress made by the Turks and their design of establishing themselves in Europe. The clergy were, of course, unanimous in support of the Crusade, and the council separated each individual member of it being empowered to preach it to his people.

Five Children and It (version 4),E. Nesbit,82629,2.0,"April 26, 2018",[],0,"ox.org. Recording by J.P.R.90. 5 Children and It by E. Nezbit. 2 John Bland. My LAM, you are so very small, you have not learned to read at all, yet never a printed book with stands the urgency of your dimple hands. So though this book is for yourself, let mother keep it on the shelf till you can read, oh days that pass, that day will come too soon, alas. Chapter 1 Beautiful as the day. The house was three miles from the station, but before the dusty hide fly had rattleed long for five minutes, the children began to put their heads out of the carriage window and to say, are we nearly there? And every time they passed a house, which was not very often, they all said, oh is this it? But it never was till they reached the very top of the hill, just pass the chalk quarry and before you come to the gravel pit. And then there was a white house with a green garden and an orchard beyond, and mother said, here we are. How white the house is, said Robert, and look at the roses, sedanthea, and the plums, said Jane, it is rather decent, Cyril admitted. The baby said, and the fly stopped with a last rattle and jolt. Everyone got its legs kicked, her feet trough none in the scramble to get out of the carriage that very minute, but no one seemed to mind. Mother, curiously enough, was in no hurry to get out, and even when she had come down slowly and by the stair pan with no jump at all, she seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in and even to pay the driver, instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and the orchard and the thorny, fissily briary, brambly wilderness beyond the broken gate, and the dry fountain at the side of the house. But the children were wise, ever once. It was not really a pretty house at all, it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves to speak of and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect's nightmare. But the house was deep in the country with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of fairy palace set down in an earthly paradise. For London, is like prison for children, especially if their relations are not rich. Of course, there are the shops and the theatres and masculine and cooks and things, but if your people are rather poor, you don't get taken to the theatres, and you can't buy things out of the shops. And London has none of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the things or themselves, such as trees and sand and woods and waters. And nearly everything in London is the wrong sort of shape, all straight lines and flat streets, instead of being all sorts of odd shapes like things are in the country. Trees are all different, as you know, and I'm sure some tires and person must have told you that there are no two blades of grass exactly alike, but in streets where the blades of grass don't grow, everything is like everything else. This is why so many children who live in towns are so extremely naughty. They do not know what is the matter with them, and no more do their fathers and mothers aren't suncalls, cousins, tutors, governesses, and nurses. But I know, and so do you now. Children in the country are naughty sometimes too, but that is for quite different reasons. The children have explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly before they were caught in clean for tea, and they saw quite well that they were certain to be happy at the White House. They thought so from the first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered with jasmine and in white flour and smelling like a bottle of the most expensive scent that is ever given for a birthday present. And when they had seen the lawn or green and smooth and quite different from the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town, and when they had found the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left, they were almost certain. And when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled out of it and got a lump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hut that seemed made to keep rabbits in, if you ever had any. They no longer had any doubts whatever. The best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to places and not doing things. In London almost everything is labeled, you mustn't touch, and though the label is invisible it's just as bad because you know it's there, or if you don't you'd surely soon get told. The White House was on the edge of a hill with a wood behind it, and the chalk quarry on one side and the gravel peered on the other. Down at the bottom of the hill was a level plain with queer shaped white buildings where people burned lime, and a big red brewery and other houses. And when the big chimneys were smoking and the sun was setting, the valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist, and the lime kilns and oast houses glimmered and glittered till they were like an enchanted city out of the Arabian nights. Now that I have begun to tell you about the place, I feel that I could go on and make this into a most interesting story about all the ordinary things that the children did, just the kind of things you do yourself, you know, and you would believe every word of it. And when I told about the children's being tiresome as you are sometimes, your answer perhaps right in the margin of the story with a pencil, how true, or how like life. And you would see it in very likely be annoyed. So I will only tell you the really astonishing thing that happened, and you may leave the book about quite safely for no one, and uncles either are likely to write, how true on the edge of the story. Grown up people find it very difficult to believe really wonderful things unless they have what they call proof, but children will believe almost anything, and grown ups know this. That is why they tell you that the earth is round like an orange, when you can see perfectly well that it is flat and lumpy. And why they say that the earth goes round the sun, when you can see for yourself any day that the sun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night like a good sun as it is, and the earth knows its place and lies as still as a mouse. Yet I dare say you believe all that about the earth and the sun, and if so you will find it quite easy to believe that before, and the earth and Cyril and the others had been a weak in the country, they had found a fairy. At least they called it that because that was what it called itself, and of course it knew best, but it was not at all like any fairy you ever saw or heard of or read about. It was at the gravel pits. Father had to go away suddenly on business, and mother had gone away to stay with Granny, who was not very well. They both went in a great hurry, and when they were gone the house seemed dreadfully quiet in empty, and the children wandered from one room to another, and looked at the bits of paper and string on the floors left over from the packing and not yet cleared up, and wish they had something to do. It was Cyril who said, I say, let's take our Margate Spades and go and dig in the gravel pits. We can pretend it's seaside. Father said it was once, and the are said. He says there are shells there thousands of years old. So they went. Of course they had been to the edge of the gravel pit and looked over, but they had not gone down into it for fear fathers should say they mustn't play there, and the same with the chalk quarry. The gravel pit is not really dangerous if you don't try to climb down the edges, but go the slow, safe way around by the road as if you were a cart. Each of the children carried its own spade and took it in turns to carry the lamb. He was the baby, and they called him that because, baah! The thing he ever said. They called amphia, panther, which seems silly when you read it, but when you say it it sounds a little like her name. The gravel pit is very large and wide, with grass growing round the edges at the top, and dry, stringy, wildflowers, purple and yellow. It is like a giant's washhand basin, and the amounts of gravel and holes in the side of the basin where gravel has been taken out, and high up in the steep sides, there are the little holes that are little front doors of the little sand martins little houses. The children built a castle, of course. The castle building is rather poor fun when you have no hope of the swishing tide ever coming into fill up the moat and wash away the drawbridge, and at the happy last, to wet everybody up to the waste at least. Cyril wanted to dig out a cave to place maglas in, but the others thought it might bury them alive, so it ended in all spades going to work to dig a hole through the castle to Australia. These children you see believed that the world was round, and that on the other side the little Australian boys and girls were really walking wrong way up, like flies on the ceiling, with their heads hanging down into the air. The children dug and they dug and they dug, and their hands got sandy and hot and red, and their faces got damp and shiny. The lamb had tried to eat the sand, and had cried so hard when he found that it was not, as he had suppowed brown sugar, that he was now tired out, and was lying asleep in a warm fat bunch in the middle of the half-finished castle. This left his brothers and sisters free to work really hard, and the whole that was to come out in Australia assumed grew so deep that Jane, who was called Pussy for short, begs the others to stop. Suppose the bottom of the whole gave way suddenly. She said, and you tumbled out among the little Australians all the sand we get in their eyes. Yes, said Robert, and they were haters and throw stones at us, and ought let us see the kangaroos or apostles or blue gums or inew brand birds or inew brand birds or inews. The brand birds or anything. Cyril and Amthia knew that Australia was not quite so near as all that, but they agreed to stop using the spades and go on with their hands. This was quite easy because the sand at the bottom of the whole was very soft and fine and dry like sea sand, and there were little shells in it. Fancy it having been wet sea here once all slumpy and shiny. How did the sea get carried away? Robert asked, not in a pale silly, so does brother. Father says the earth got too hot underneath, like you do in bed sometimes, so it just hunched up its shoulders and the sea had to slip off, like the blankets do of us. And the shoulder was lifts sticking out and turned into dry land. Let's go and look for shells. I think that little cave looks likely, and I see something sticking out there like a bit of wrecked ship's anchor. And it's beastly hot in the Australian hole. The others agreed. But Amthia went on digging. She always liked to finish a thing when she had once begun it. She felt it would be a disgrace to leave that hole without getting through to Australia. The cave was disappointing because there were no shells and the wrecked ship's anchor turned out to be only the broken end of a pickax handle. And the cave party were just making up their minds that the sand makes you thirsty when it is not by the seaside, and someone had suggested going home for lemonade when Amthia suddenly screamed, Cyril, come here or come quick, it's alive, it'll get away quick. They all hurried back. It's a rat I shouldn't wonder. Sid Robert, Father says the invest old places, and this must be pretty old if the sea was here thousands of years ago. Perhaps it is a snake? Said Jane Shuddering. Let's look. Sit Cyril jumping into the hole. I'm not afraid of snakes, I like them. If it is a snake, I'll tame it, little folly everywhere, and I'll let it slip around my neck at night. No you won't, said Robert firmly. He shared Cyril's bedroom. But you may if it's a rat. I'll don't be silly. Sid Amthia. It's not a rat, it's much bigger, and it's not a snake, it's got feet I saw them, and fur. No, not the spade, you'll hurt it. Dig with your hands. And let it hurt me instead, that's so likely as knit. Sid Cyril ceasing a spade. Or don't, Sid Amthia. Scroll or don't, I, it sounds silly, but it said something. It really intruded. What? It said, you let me alone. But Cyril merely observed that his sister must have gone off her nut, and he and Robert dug with spades, while Amthia sat on the edge of the hole jumping up and down with hotness and anxiety. They dug carefully, and presently, everyone could see that there really was something moving in the bottom of the Australian hole. Then Amthia cried out, I'm not afraid. Let me dig. And fell on her knees and began to scratch like a dog does when he suddenly remembered where it was that he buried his bone. Oh, I felt fur. She cried. Half-loving and half-crying. I didn't indeed, I did. When suddenly a dry, husky voice in the sand made the more jump back, and their hearts jumped nearly as fast as they did. Let me alone, it said, and now everyone heard the voice, and looked at the others to see if they had two. But we want to see you. Said Robert bravely. I wish you'd come out. Sid Amthia, also taking courage. Oh, well, if that's your wish, the voice said, and the sand stirred and spun and scattered, and something brown and furry and fat came rolling out into the hole and the sand fell off it, and it sat there yawning and rubbing the end of its eyes with its hands. I believe I must have dropped a sleep. It said stretching itself. The children stood round the hole in a ring, looking at the creature they had found. It was worth looking at. Its eyes were on long horns like a snail's eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes. It had ears like a bat sears, and its tubi body was shaped like a spiders and covered with thick soft fur. Its legs and arms were furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkeys. What's on earth is it? Jane said, shall we take it home? The thing turned its long eyes to look at her and said, does she always talk nonsense or is it only the rubbish on her head that makes her silly? It looks gornfully at Jane's hat as its spoke. She doesn't mean to be silly. And he has said gently. We never do whatever you may think. Don't be frightened, we don't want to hurt you, you know. Hurt me? It said, me, frightened. Upon my word. Why are you talking if I were nobody in particular? All its first did out like a cat's when it is going to fight. Well, said Aunt the Earth still kindly. Perhaps if we knew who you are in particular, we could think of something to say that wouldn't make you cross. Everything was set so far seems to have. Who are you? And don't get angry because really we don't know. You don't know? It said, Well, I knew that the world had changed, but really, do you mean to tell me seriously you don't know a samiad when you see one? A samiad? That's Greek to me. So it is to everyone to the creature sharply. Well, in plain English then, a sand fairy. Don't you know a sand fairy when you see one? It looked so grieved and hurt that Jane hastened to say, Of course I see you are now. It's quite plain now when comes to look at you. You came to look at me several sentences ago. It said, crossly, beginning to curl up again in the sand. Oh, don't go again, but do talk some more. Robert cried, I didn't know you were a sand fairy, but I knew directly I saw you that you were much the wonderful thing I'd ever seen. The sand fairy seemed as shade less disagreeable after this. It doesn't talk in my mind. It said, as long as you're reasonably civil. But I'm not going to make polite conversation for you. If you talk nicely to me, perhaps alarms you and perhaps I won't. Now say something. Of course no one could think of anything too say. But at last Robert thought of how long of you lived here, and he said it once. Oh ages, several thousand years, replied the samiad. Tell us all about it, do. It's all in books. You aren't? Jane said, I'll tell us everything you can about yourself. We don't know anything about you, and you are so nice. The sand fairy smoothed his long, rat-like whiskers and smile between them. Do you please tell? Said the children all together. It is wonderful how quickly you get used to things, even the most astonishing. Five minutes before the children had no more idea than you that there was such a thing as a sand fairy in the world, and now they were talking to it as though they had known it all their lives. It drew its eyes in and said, her very sunny it is. Quite like old times. Where do you get your megal theorems from now? What? Said the children all at once. It is very difficult always to remember that what is not polite, especially in moments of surprise or agitation. A tear-adactual is plentiful now. The sand fairy went on. The children were unable to reply. What do you have a breakfast? The fairy said impatiently, and who gives it you? Eggs and bacon and bread and milk and porridge and things. Mother gives it us. What a megal, what's his name and tear-up? What you call them? And does anyone have them for breakfast? I almost everyone had terredactual for breakfast in my time. Terredactuals were something like crocodiles and something like birds. I believe they were very good grilled. You see, it was like this. Of course, there were heaps of sandberries there, and in the morning, early, you went out and hunted for them, and when you found one, it gave you your wish. People used to send their little boys down to the sea shore early in the morning before breakfast to get the days wishes, and very often the eldest boy in the family would be told to wish for a mega-thirium, ready-jointed for cooking. It was as big as an elephant you see, there was a good deal of meat on it, and if they wanted fish, the egg-the-assaurus was asked for. He was 20-40 feet long so there was plenty of him. And for poultry, there was the plezier sorris. There were ice-picking on that too. Then the other children could wish for other things. But when people had dinner parties, it was nearly always mega-thiriums, and it clear sorrows because his things were a great delicacy and his tail made soup. There must have been heaps and heaps of cold meat leftover, sedanther, who meant to be a good housekeeper someday. Oh no, said the samiad, that would never have done. Why, of course, it's sunset what was leftover turned into stone. He found the stone bones of the mega-thirium and things all over the place, even now they tell me. Who tell you, asked Cyril? But the sand-fairy frowned began to dig very fast with its furry hands. I don't go. The all-kried. Tell us more about it when it was mega-thiriums for breakfast. Was the world like this then? It stopped digging. Not a bit. It said, it was nearly all sand-rileved, and cold-row-on-trees and the peri-winkles were as big as tea trays. You find them now they turned into stone. We sand-varies used to live on the sea shore, and the children used to come with their little flint spades and flint pales and make castles rest a living. That's thousands of years ago, but I hear that children still build castles on the sand. It's difficult to break yourself out of a habit. But why did you stop living in the castles? Asked Robert. It's a sad story, said the samiad gloomily. It was because they would build moats to the castles, and the nasty wet bubbling sea used to come in. And of course as soon as a sand-vary got wet, it caught cold and generally died. And so they got to be fewer and fewer, and whenever you found a fairy and had a wish, you used to wish for a mega-thirium, and it twice as much as you wanted, because it might be weeks before you got another wish. And did you get wet? Robert inquired. The sand-vary shuddered. Only once, it said. The end of the 12th hair of my top-left whisker. I feel the place still in damp weather. It was only once, but it was quite enough for me. I went away as soon as the sun had dried my poor dear whisker. I scoured away to the back of the beach and dug myself a house deep in warm dry sand, and there I've been ever since. And the sea changed its lodgings afterwards. And now I'm not going to tell you another thing. Just one more, please. Said the children. Can you give wishes now? Of course, said it. Didn't I give you yours a few minutes ago? You said, I wish you'd come out. And I did. Oh, please, mate, we have another. Yes, but be quick about it, I'm tired of you. I dare say you have often thought what you would do if you had three wishes given you, and it despises the old man and his wife in the black pudding story, and felt certain that if you had the chance, you could think of three really useful wishes without a moment's hesitation. These children had often talked this matter over, but now the chance had suddenly come to them. They could not make up their minds. Quick! Said the sound very crossly. No one could think of anything. Only Amthia did manage to remember a private wish of her own and James, which they had never told the boys. She knew the boys would not care about it, still it was better than nothing. I wish we'd roll as beautiful as the day. She said in a great hurry. The children looked at each other, but each could see that the others were not any better looking than usual. The Samiad pushed out its long eyes, and seemed to be holding its breath and swelling itself out and it was twice as fat and furry as before. Suddenly it let its breath go in a long sigh. I'm really afraid I can't manage it. It said apologetically, and as we are to practice, the children were horribly disappointed. Oh, do try again! They said, well, said the San Ferry. The fact is, I was keeping back a little strength to give the rest of you wishes with. If you'll be contended with one wish a day amongst the lot of you, I'd say I can screw myself up to it. Do you agree to that? Yes, oh yes! Said Jane and Anthea. The boy is nodded. They did not believe the San Ferry could do it. You can always make girls believe things much easier than you can't boys. It stretched out its eyes farther than never, and swilled and swelled and swelled. I do hope it won't hurt itself. San Ferry. Or crack its skin? Robert said anxiously. Everyone was very much relieved when the San Ferry, after getting so big that it almost filled up the hole in the sand, suddenly let out its breath and went back to its proper size. That's all right. It said panting heavily. It'll come easier tomorrow. Did it hurt much? I'll stand there. Only my poor whiskers thank you. Said he, but ira kind and thoughtful child. Good day. It scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet, and disappeared in the sand. Then the children looked at each other. And each child suddenly found itself alone with three perfect strangers. All radially beautiful. They stood for some moments in perfect silence. Each thought that its brothers and sisters had wandered off, and that these strange children had stolen up a notice while it was watching the swelling form of the sandferry. And the a spoke first. Excuse me? She said very politely to Jane, who now had enormous blue eyes and a cloud of rust at hair. But have you seen two little boys and a little girl anywhere about? I was just going to ask you that. Said Jane. And then, Cyril cried, Why it's you? I know the hole in your pinnaphore, you are Jane, aren't you? And you are the Panther. I can see your dirty handkerchief that you've got to change after you cut your thumb. Cricky, the wit has come off after all. I say am I as handsome as you are? If you're Cyril, I like you much better as you were before. Said I'm the a decidedly. You look like the picture of the young Corrister with your golden hair. Yulta I young I shouldn't wonder. And if that's Robert, he's like an Italian organ grinder. His hair's all black. You two girls are like Christmas cards then, that's all. Silly Christmas cards. Said Robert angrily. A Jane's hair is simply carrots. It was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists. Well, it's no use finding fault with each other. Sadamthea. Let's get the lamb and lug it home to dinner. The servants will admire us most awfully, you'll see. Baby was just waking when they got him, and not one of the children, but was relieved to find that he at least was not as beautiful as the day, but just the same as usual. I suppose he's too young to have which is naturally. Said Jane. Which I'll have to mention him especially next time. Amthia ran forward and held out her arms. Come to my infant the ducky. She said, The baby looked at her disapprovingly and put a sandy pink thumb in his mouth. Amthia was his favourite sister. Come then. She said, grey young. Said the baby. Come to ain't pussy. Said Jane. Once my pancy. Said the lamb is mally and is lipped trembled. He'd come on veteran. said Robert. Come and have a you idea on your beys back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Bye. Help the baby, giving way all together. Then the children knew the worst. The baby did not know them. know them. They looked at each other in despair. And it was terrible to each in this dire emergency to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect strangers instead of the merry, friendly, commonplace, twinkling, jolly little eyes of its own brothers and sisters. This is most truly awful. Sid Cyril, when he had tried to lift up the lamb, and the lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a bull. We've got to make friends with him. I can't carry him home screaming like that. Fans are having to make friends with our own baby, it's too silly. That, however, was exactly what they had to do. It took over an hour, and the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the lamb was by this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert. At last, he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by turns. But as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances, he was a dead weight and most exhausting. Thank goodness were home. Sid Jane, staggering through the iron gates to where Martha, the nurse made, stood at the front door, shading her eyes with her hand and looking out anxiously. He had do take baby. Martha snatched the baby from her arms. Thanks be, he's safe back. She said. Where are the others? And however did good disgrace us a roll of yo? Were you us, of course? said Robert. And who's asked when you're at home? Ask Martha scornfully. I tell you it's us only for as beautiful as the day, Sid Cyril. I'm Cyril and these are the others and we're jolly hungry. Letters in and don't be a silly idiot. Martha merely dreaded Cyril's impudence and tried to shut the door in his face. I know we look different but I'm Anthea and we're so tired and it's long passed in a time. And go home to your dinners, whoever you are. And if our children put you up to this play act in, you can tell them from me they'll catch you so they know what to expect. With that she did bang the door. Cyril rang the bell violently. No answer. President Lee Cook put a head out of a bedroom window and said, if you don't take yourselves off in that precious shot, I'll go and fetch the police. And she slammed down the window. It's no good, Sir Anthea. Oh, dude, do you come away before we get into prison? The boys said it was nonsense and the law of England couldn't put you in prison but just being as beautiful as the day. But all the same, they followed the others out into the lane. We shall be our proper selves after sunset, I suppose. Said Jane. I don't know. Cyril said sadly. It might be like that now. Things have changed a good deal since Megathirium times. Oh! Cryed Anthea suddenly. Perhaps we shall turn into Stoleness on so like the Megathirium did so that there might be any of us left over for the next day. She began to cry. So did Jane. Even the boys turned pale. No one had the heart to say anything. It was a horrible afternoon. There was no house near where the children could be a crust of bread or even a glass of water. They were afraid to go to the village because they had seen Martha go down there with a basket. And there was a local constable. True, they were all as beautiful as the day, but that is a poor comfort when you're as hungry as a hunter and as thirsty as a sponge. Three times they tried in vain to get the servants in the white house to let them in and listen to their tail. And then Robert went alone hoping to be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door to the others. But all the windows were out of reach. And Martha emptied a toilet jug of cold water over him from a top window and said, Go along with you and ask you a little Italian monkey. It came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge, with their feet in a dry ditch waiting for sunset. And wondering whether when the sun did set, they were turned into stone or only into their own old natural selves. And each of them still felt lonely in among strangers and tried not to look at the others. For though their voices were their own, their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite irritating to look at. I don't believe we shall turn to stone. Said Robert, breaking a long miserable silence. Because the sun there he said he'd give us another wish to borrow. And he couldn't if we were stone could he? The others said no, but they weren't at all comforted. Another silence, longer and more miserable, was broken by Cyril suddenly saying, I don't want to frighten you girls, but I believe it's beginning with me already. My foot's quite dead. I'm turning to stone. I know I haven't said well you in a minute. Never mind. Said Robert kindly. Perhaps you'll be the only stone one. And the rest of us will be all right and we'll cherish your statue and hang gollins on it. But when it turned out that Cyril's footed only gone to sleep through his sitting too long with it under him, and when it came to life in an agony of pins and needles, the others were quite cross. Giving us such a fright for nothing. Said Andrea. The third and misroblest silence of all was broken by Jane. She said, If we do come out of this all right, we'll ask the Samyat to make it so that the servants don't notice anything different, no matter what which is we have. The others only granted. They were too wretched even to make good resolutions. At last, hunger and fright and crossness and tightness, for very nasty things, all joined together to bring one nice thing, and that was sleep. The children lay a sleep in a row with their beautiful eyes shut and their beautiful mouths open. Amthia woke first. The sun had set and the twilight was coming on. Amthia pinched herself very hard to make sure. And when she found she could still feel pinching, she decided that she was not stone. And then she pinched the others. They also were soft. Wake up! She said, almost in tears of joy. It's all right when not stone. And I'll sirel how nice and ugly you do look with your old freckles and your brown hair and your little eyes. And so do you all. She added, so that they might not feel jealous. When they got home, they were very much scolded by Martha, who told them about the strange children. A good look at what I must say, but that impudent, I know. said Robert, who knew by experience how hopeless it would be to try to explain things to Martha. And where were none other you been all this time, you naughty little things you? In the lane. Why didn't you come home hours ago? We couldn't because of them. Sadanthia. Oh, the children who are as beautiful as the day, they kept us there till after sunset. We couldn't come back till they'd gone. You don't know how we hated them. Oh, do, do give us some supper, we are so hungry. Hungry, I should think so. Sid Martha, angrily. At all day like this. Well, I hope it'll be a lesson, do you not go picking up the strange children? Down here after measles is likely as not. Now mind, if you see them again, don't you speak to them. Not one word nor so much as a look, but come straight away until me. I'll spoil their beauty for them. If ever we do see them again, we'll tell you. And he has said. And Robert fixing his eyes fondly on the cold beef that was being brought in on a tray by cook. Added in heartfelt undertones. And we'll take jolly good care we never do see them again. And they never have.

The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood by Thomas Hood, the Biographical Introduction by William Michael Rosetti, Part 1. Red for Librevox.org by MC Johnny G. January 24th, 2017 www.emcejony.com There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood. One condition there was of two potent determining importance, lifelong ill health, and one circumstance of moment, a commercial failure and consequent expatriation. Beyond this, little presents itself for record in the outward facts of this upright and beneficial career. Bright with genius and co-uscating with wit, dark with the lengthening and deepening shadow of death. The father of Thomas Hood was engaged in business as a publisher and bookseller in the poultry in the city of London. A member of the firm of Werner Hood and Sharp, he was a scotchman and had come up to the capital city early in life to make his way. His interest in books was not solely confined to their sailable quality. He reprinted various old works with success, published Bloomfield's poems, and dealt handsomely with him, and what himself the author of two novels, which are stated to have had some success in their day. For the sake of the sun, rather than the father, one would like to see some account with adequate specimens of these long forgotten tales. For the queries which Thomas Hood asks concerning the pideous woman of his bridge of size, interest us all concerning a man of genius and interest us moreover with regard to the question of intellectual as well as natural affinity. Who was his father? Who was his mother? Had he a sister? Had he a brother? Another line of work in which the elder Hood is recorded to have been active was the opening of the English book trade with America. He married a sister of the engraver Mr. Sands and had by her a large family, two sons and four daughters survived the period of childhood. The elder brother James, who died early of consumption, drew well as did also one or two of the sisters. It would seem therefore when we recall Thomas Hood's aptitudes and frequent miscellaneous practice in the same line that a certain tendency towards fine art, as well as towards literature, ran in the family. The consumption which killed James appears to have been inherited from his mother. She and two of her daughters died of the same disease and a pulmonary affection of a somewhat different kind became as we shall see one of the poets most inventorate her secuters. The death of the father, which was sudden and unexpected, preceded that of the mother, but not of James and left the survivors in rather straightened circumstances. Thomas, the second of the two sons, was born in the poultry, on or about the 23rd of May 1799. He is stated to have been a retired child with much quiet humor. Chuckling, we may guess, over his own quaint imaginings, which must have come in crowds and of all conceivable or inconceivable sorts to judge from the products of his after years. Keeping most of these fancies and surprises to himself, but every now and then letting some of them out and giving homely or stolid bystanders an inkling of insight into the many peopleed crannies of his boyish brain. He received his education at Dr. Wannustrock School at Clapham. It is not very clear how far this education extended. I should infer that it was just about enough and not more than enough to enable hood to shift for himself in the career of authorship. Without serious disadvantage from inadequate early training and also without much a dense derived, without at any rate, any such rousing and refining of the literary sense, as would warrant us in attributing to educational influences, either the inclination to become an author or the manipulative power over language and style which hood displayed in his serious poems, not to speak of those of a lighter kind. We seem to see him sliding as it were into the profession of letters, simply through capacity and liking in the course of events, not because he had resolutely made up his mind to be an author, nor because his natural faculty had been steadily or studiously cultivated. As to details, it may be remarked that his schooling included some amount, perhaps a fair average amount of Latin. We find it stated that he had a Latin prize at school, but was not apt at the language in later years. He had, however, one kind of aptitude at it, being addicted to the use of familiar Latin quotations or phrases cited with humorous verbal perversions. In all the relations of family life and the forms of family affection, hood was simply exemplary. The deaths of his elder brother and of his father left him the principle, reliance of his mother, herself destined soon to follow them to the tomb. He was an excellent and devoted son. His affection for one of his sisters and, who also died shortly afterwards, is attested in the beautiful lines named the deathbed. We watched her breathing through the night. At a later date, the loaves of a husband and a father seem to have absorbed by far the greater part of his nature and his thoughts. His letters to friends are steeped and drenched in, Jane, Fanny, and Tom Jr. These letters are mostly divided between perpetual family details and perennial joccularity, a succession of witnesses, or at lowest of puns and whims' equalities, mounts up like so many squibs and crackers, fizzling through sparkling amid, or ultimately extinguished by the inevitable shower. The steady rush and downpour of the home of actions. It may easily be inferred from this account that there are letters which one is inclined to read more thoroughly and in greater number consecutively than hoods. The vocation first selected for hood, towards the age of 15, was one which he did not follow up for long. That of an engraver, he was a prentist to his uncle, Mr. Sands, and afterwards to one of the lacqueru family. The occupation was ill-suited to his constantly-ailing health, and this eventually can do's to his abandoning it. He then went to Scotland to recruit remaining there among his relatives about five years. According to a statement made by himself, he was in a merchants office within this interval. It is uncertain, however, whether this assertion is to be accepted as genuine, or is made for some purpose of fun. His first published writing appeared in the Dundee advertiser in 1814. His age being then at the utmost 15 and a half, this was succeeded by some contribution to a local magazine. But as yet, he had no idea of authorship as a profession. Towards the middle of the year 1820, hood was resettled in London, improved in health and just come of age. At first, he continued practicing as an engraver. But in 1821, he began to act as a sort of sub-editor for the London magazine after the death of the editor Mr. Scott in a duel. He concocted fictitious and humorous answers to correspondence. A humble yet appropriate introduction to the insatiable habit and faculty for out of the way verbal jacocity which marked off his after career from that of all other excellent poets. His first regular contribution to the magazine in July 1821 was a little poem to hope. Even before this, as early at any rate as 1815, he was in the frequent practice of writing correctly and at some length in verse as witnessed by selections now in print from what he had composed for the amusement of his relatives. Soon afterwards, a private literary society was the recipient of other verses of the same order. The lines to hope were followed in the London magazine by the old two-duck per Kitchener and some further poems, including the important work, like is the Centaur. After the publication of which, there could not be much out of the genuine and uncommon powers of the new writer. The last contribution of hood to this magazine was the lines to a cold beauty. Another early work of his and one witch, like the verses to the moon, affords marked evidence of the impression which he had received from Keats Poetry is the unfinished drama or as he termed it, romance of Lambia. I do not find it's precise date recorded. It's verses lacks and it's tone somewhat immature, yet it shows a great deal of sparkling and diversified talent. Hood certainly takes a rather more rational view than Keats did of his subject as a moral invention or a myth having some sort of meaning at its root. A serpent transformed into a woman who begiles the youth of the highest hopes into amorous language self-emban amendment is clearly not in morals. The sort of person that ought to be left uncontrolled to her own devices. Keats ostentatiously resents the action of the unimpatched philosopher Apolognius in revealing the true nature of the woman's serpent and dissolving her spell. An elderly petant to interfere with the pretty whims of a viper when she wears the outer semblance of a fine woman. Intolerable. Such is the sentiment of Keats, but such plainly is not altogether the conviction of hood, although history remains but partially developed. By this time it may have become pretty clear to himself and others that is proper vocation and destined profession was literature. Through the London magazine he got to know John Hamilton Reynolds, author of the Garden of Florence and other poems and a contributor to this serial under the pseudonym of Edward Herbert, Charles Lamb, Allen Cunningham, Dick Quincy and other writers of reputation. To hood, the most directly important of all these acquaintances was Mr. Reynolds. This gentleman having a sister Jane to whom hood was introduced and attachment ensued and shortly terminated in marriage. The wedding taking place on the 5th of May 1824. The father of Miss Reynolds was the head writing master at Christ Hospital. She is stated to have had good manners, a cultivated mind and literary taste, though a high educational standard is not always traceable in her letters. At any rate, the marriage was a happy one. Mrs. Hood being a tender and attentive wife, unwearied in the cares which her husband's precarious helped demanded. And he being, as I have said, a mirror of marital, constancy and devotion, distinguishable from a lover, rather by his intense delight in all domestic relations and details than by any cooling down in his fondness. It would appear that in the later years of hood's life. He was not on entirely good terms with some members of his wife's family, including his old friend, John Hamilton Reynolds. What may have caused this, I do not find specified. All that we know of the character of hood justifies us and thinking that he was little or not all to blame for he appears throughout a man of just, honourable and loving nature and free besides from that sort of self-assertion, which invites a collision. Everyone, however, has his blemishes and we may perhaps discern and hood a certain overredtingness to think himself imposed upon and the fellow creatures with whom he had immediately to do a generation of vipers, a state of feeling, not characteristic of a mine exalted and magnanimous by habit or gentle in the older and more significant meaning of the term. The time was now come for hood to venture a volume upon the world. Conjoinly with Reynolds, he wrote and published in 1825, his Oads and addresses to great people. The title page bore no author's name, but the extraordinary talent and point of the work could hardly fail to be noticed, even apart from its appeal to immediate popularity dealing as it did so continually with the uppermost topics of the day. It had what it deserved, a great success. This volume was followed in 1826 by the first series of whims and oddities, which also met with a good sale, the second series appeared in 1827. Next came two volumes of national tales, somewhat after the manner of Bacachio, but how far different from his spirit may easily be surmised, which are now little known. The volume containing the plea of the mid-summer fairies, hero and lander, and some other of hoods most finished in noticeable poems, came out in 1827. The mid-summer fairies itself was one of the author's own favorite works and certainly deserved to be so, as far as dainty elegance of motive and of execution is concerned, but the conception was a little too ingeniously remote for the public to ratify the author's predilection. The hero and theander will be at once recognized as modeled on the style of Elizabethan narrative poems. Indeed, Marlo treated the very same subject, and his poem, left uncompleated, was finished by Chapman. Hoods is the most astonishing example of a revivalist poetry. It is reproductive and spontaneous at the same time. It resembles its models closely, not survially, significantly, not mechanically, and as the great merit of resembling them with comparative moderation. Elizabethan, here both in spirit and in letter, Hood is nevertheless a little less extreme than his prototypes, where they loaded, he does not find it needful to overload, which is the ready and almost the inevitable resource of revivalists. All but the fewest on the contrary, he alleviates a little, but only a little. In 1829, appeared the most famous of all his poems of a narrative character, the dream of Eugene Ahram. It was published in the gem, an annual which the poet was then editing. Besides this amount of literary activity, Hood continued writing and periodicals, sometimes under the signature of Theodore M. His excessive and immeasurable addiction to rollicking fun, to the perpetual cracking of jokes, for it amounts to that more definitely than anything else in the domain of the comic muse. Is it somewhat curious problem? Taking in connection with his remarkable genius and accomplishment as a poet and his personal character as a solid housekeeping citizen, bent chiefly upon rearing his family and respectability, and paying his way, or as the church cataclysm has neatly and unimprovenably expressed it, upon doing his duty in that state of life to which it is pleased God to call him, his almost constant ill health and in a minor degree the troubles which beset him in money matters, make the problem all the more noticeable. The influence of Charles Lamb may have had something to do with it, probably not very much. Perhaps there was something in the literary atmosphere or the national tone of the time, which gave comicality a turn of predominance after the subsiding of the great poetic wave which filled the last years of the 18th and the first quarter of the 19th century in our country in Blake Burns Wordsworth Scott Colbridge, Landor, Byron Keats and Supreme Among All Shelly. Something of the same transition may be noticed in the art of design. The multiferious illustrator in the prior generation is stothard in the later Krushank at any rate in literature, lambhood and then Dickens in his earliest works, the sketches by Baws and Pickwick are uncommonly characteristic and leading minds and bent with singular inveteracy upon being funny, though not funny and nothing else at all. But we should not force this consideration too far, who it is a central figure in the group and the period and the tendency of the time may be almost as much due to him as he to the tendency. Mainly, we have to fall back upon his own idiosyncrasy. He was born with a boundlessly whimsical perception, which he trained into an inimitable, slight of hand in the twisting of notions and of words. Circumstances favored his writings for fugitive publications and skimming readers, rather than under conditions of greater permanency, and the result is, as we find it in his works. His son expresses the opinion that part of hoods success in comic writing arose from his early reading of Humphrey Clinker, Tristum Shady, Tom Jones, and other works of that period, and imbuing himself with their style, a remark, however, which applies to his prose rather than his poetical works. Certain, it is that the appetite for all kinds of fun, verbal and other, was a part of hoods nature. We see it in the practical jokes he was continually playing on his good, humored wife, such as altering into grotesque absurdity many of the words contained in her letters to friends. We see it the mere animal love of joy as it might be termed in such a small point as as frequently addressing his friend Philip De Frank. In letters by the words, Tim says he, instead of any human appellative, hood reminds us very much of one of Shakespeare's fools to use the word in no-in-videous sense, transported into the 19th century. The fool and King Lear or Touchdown. For the occasional sallies of courseness or rivalry, the spirit of the time has substituted at bourgeois good humor, which respects the family circle and haunts the kitchen stairs. For the biting gear intended to make some victim uncomfortable, it gives the sarcastic or sprightly banter, not unconscious of an effort at moral amelioration. For the sententious, sagacity and humorous enjoyment of the nature of man, it gives bright thoughts and a humanitarian sympathy. But on the whole, the intellectual personality is nearly the same, seeking by natural affinity and enjoying to the uttermost, whatever tends to lightness of heart and to ridicule, thus dwelling indeed in the region of the commonplace and the gross, but constantly informing it with some suggestion of poetry, some wise side meaning, or some form of sweetness and grace. These observations relate of course to hood's humorous poems. Into his grave and pathetic poems he can import qualities still lofty or than these, though even here it is not often that he utterly for swears quaintness and oddity. The visible, the fantastic was his beacon light, sometimes as delicate as a delive glow worms, sometimes as a proreus as a bonfire, sometimes it must be said for he had to be perpetually writing whether the inspiration came or not, or his inspiration was too liable to come from the very platitudes and pettiness of everyday life. Not much more brilliant than a rush light and hardly more aromatic than the snuff of a talo candle. End of biographical introduction part one.

Around The Campfire,Sir Charles G. D. Roberts,152498,3.0,"March 2, 2018",[],0,"vox.org, recording by David Wales, around the campfire by Charles Roberts. Chapter 1, off to the Squatooks, the panther at the Parcinage, bear versus Birchmark. It was toward the end of July, and Frederick 10, the little New Brunswick capital, had grown hot beyond endurance when six devoted canoeists, Stranian Magnus Quirman, Sam Ranoff and myself, heard simultaneously the voices of wild rapids calling to them from afar. The desire of the woods awoken us, the vagrant blood that lurks in the veins of our race, sprang up and refused to be still. The very next day we fled from the city and starched colors, seeking freedom and the cool of the wilderness. It was toward Lake Temis Quarta, and the wilds of the Squatooks that we set our eager faces, insured sleeves and moccasins we went, for convenience we had our clothes stitched full of pockets, our three good birch canose and our other impedimenta we put on board a flat car at the station, and that same evening found us at the village of Edmundston, where the Maruasca flows into the St. John at a point about 150 miles above Frederickton. Unless you are an experienced canoeman, skilled not only with the battle, but with the pole, and expert to run the roughest rapids, you should take a guide with you on the Squatook trip, you should go in the bow of your canoe with a trusty Indian in the stern, one Indian and one canoe for each man of the party. The art of pulling a birch bark against a stiff current is no easy one to acquire, and needs both aptitude and practice. Your Indian will teach you in the gentler waters, the rest of the time you may lounge at your ease casting a fly from side to side and ever climbing on between the changing shores. But as for us we needed no Indians, we were all six masters of canoecraft, each took his turn at the white spruce pole, and we conquered the currents rejoicing. Timisquate is a long narrow lake, just outside the boundaries of New Brunswick, it lies in the province of Quebec, but its outlet is the Madawasca River, a New Brunswick stream, our plan of proceeding was to take to the canoes at Edmonton, and pole 15 miles up the Madawasca, make a portage of five miles across country to Mad Lake, follow Beard's Librock the outlet of Mad Lake to its junction with the Squatook River, and then slip down this swift stream with its chain of placid expansions to we should float out upon the waters of Delidi Lake. Delidi River would then receive us among its angry rapids and cascades to eject us forcibly at last upon the great bosom of Timisquate, once we should find plain paddling back to Edmonton. This would make a round trip of say 140 miles, and all of them save the first 15 with the current. At Edmonton that evening we pitched our tent beside the stream, and next morning though it was raw and threatening we made an early start. In one canoe went Strenian and Quirman in the second salmon ran off in the third Magnus and Myself. The bedding, extra clothing, etc. Laced up snugly in squares of oiled canvas, made luxurious seats while the eatables were stored in light strong boxes built to fit the canoes. The first day out is usually uneventful, and this was no exception. When adventures are looked for, they pretty certainly fail to arrive. We reached the portage with an hour of daylight to spare, and their found an old log cabin, which saved us the necessity of pitching our tent. It was dry, well-ventilated, abundantly, uncivilized, what a supper Strenian cooked for us, and then what a swarm of mosquitoes and miges flocked into bit as welcome. We hedged ourselves about with a cordon of slow fires of Cedar Park, the smoke of which proved most distasteful to them, and almost equally so to us. And then with a clear blaze crackling before the open door, and our blankets spread on armfills of spruce bows, we disposed ourselves, luxuriously, for pipes and yorns. Quirman drew a long blissful whiff through his corn cob, blew a succession of rings, and murmured like a great bumblebee. The world is vagabondia, to him, who is a vagabond. Well, who'll tell us the first yarn, acquired Sam, as his pipe drew freely. Strenian began, said magnus quietly, Magnus was a man a few words, but when he opened his mouth, what he said went, he was apt to do more and say less than anyone else in the party. Well, boys, said Strenian, if Magnus says so, here goes, what shall I talk about? Who ever heard of Strenian talking about anything but Panthers, Jürgen, of? Well, I sent it Strenian, there's something in what you say. The other night I was thinking over the various adventures which have befallen me, in my devotion to Bert and Paddle, it surprises me to find what a lot of scrapes I've got into with the Panthers. The broots seem to fairly haunt me. Of course, fellows who go every year into the squadook woods are bound to have adventures, more or less, you get cornered maybe by an old bull mousse or have a close shave with some excited bear, or strike an unusually ugly length, or get spilled out of the canoe when you're trying to run to the default. But in my case, it is a panther every time. Whenever I go into the woods, there is sure to be one of these creatures sneaking around. I declare it makes me quite uneasy to think of it, though I've always got the best of them so far. I'll bet you a trout, there are one or two spotting me now from those black thickets on the mountain, and one of these days, if I don't look sharp, they'll be getting even with me for all the members of their family that I have cut off in their sins. Oh, you go long. Exclaimed Sam, you're getting sentimental. I can tell you, I have killed more trout than you have panthers, and there's no old patriarch of a trout going to yet even with me. Sam's practical remark went unheeded, and in a few moments, Strandian resumed. You see, boys, the beasts began to haunt me in, my very cradle, so to speak, did any of you ever hear mother tell that story? I have ejaculated Guirman, but the rest of us, pace into declare our ignorance, very well, said Strandian, Guirman shall see that I stick to the facts. Oh, boys, I've a heavy contract on hand, then, quite Guirman, but Strandian, blindly ignored him and continued, I'll call this tale the panther at the Parcinage. You have all seen the old Parcinage at the mouth of the Kesek River, that's a historic edifice for you, therein was I born, there were more trees around it than now. At the mature age of ten months, I moved away from that neighborhood, but not before the Indian devil, as the panther is called in that region, had found me out and marked me as a foreordained antagonist. One bright June morning when I was about five months old, and not yet able to be much protection to my young mother, my father set out on one of his long parochial drives, and we were left alone. No, not quite alone, there was Susan, the kitchen girl, for company, that constituted the garrison of the Parcinage on that event for morning, mother, Susan, and myself. I cannot say I remember what took place, but I have so often been told it, that I feel as if I had taken an active part. Mother and I were sitting by an open window downstairs, looking out on the front yard, when suddenly mother called out sharply, Susan, Susan, come here and see what sort of creature this is coming through the grove. There was a frightened ring in my mother's voice which brought Susan promptly to her side. Adjust then the creature, which was long and low and stealthy, reached the garden fence, it mounted the fence gracefully and paused to look about. With a horrified gasp, a mother caught me to her bosom and whispered, it's a tiger. No, I'm cry to Susan at it, no tiger, but it's an engine devil which is pretty nice bed, and she ran and slammed down the window. The noise attracted the brute's attention, he glanced our way, dropped to the ground, and crept stealthily toward the house. The attic cried mother wildly, all the windows downstairs are wide open. I need hardly assure you, boys, it didn't take those two women and me very long to get upstairs. As we reach the top, we heard a crash in the parlor, and mother nearly squeezed me to death in her terror for me, but Susan exclaimed almost gleefully, a dick clare at the ankle in the wrong window, parlor door shut. By this time we were on the attic stairs, and the door at the foot of the stairs, a solid old-fashioned country door was safely bolted behind us. That door was the only means of access to the attic, and on the head of the stairs we all sat down to take breath. Then, in mother, the anxious house-to-wife began to reappear. What has that horror-dibrewed brook in the parlor, Susan, she queried? Oh, must have been then dishes on the little table by the winterman, responded the girl, and then we heard a clatter again, as the beast in springing out of the window, knocked the fragments of pottery aside. In a few moments, he found another entrance, the soft-pat pat of his great furry feet, could be heard on the lower stairs. He was evidently hungry, and much puzzled at our sudden disappearance. We could hear him sniffing around in and out of the bedrooms, and at last that soft persistent tread found its way to the attic door. How he did sniff about the bottom of that door, till the blood of his prisoner is rancold with horror. Then he began to scratch, which was more than they could stand. Terror lent them invention, and mother put me into a basket of old clothes while she helped Susan drag a heavy bedstead to the head of the stairs. This bedstead effectually blocked the narrow stairway, and when they had piled a chest of drawers on top of it, they once more felt secure. All this trouble was unneeded, however, as that door opening outward was an insurmountable barrier to the panther. In a few minutes, he stole away restlessly. Then we heard some flower pots, which stood on the window ledge of the front bedroom, go crash on the steps below. The Indian devil was getting out of the window. Now the attic in which we had taken refuge was lighted by two windows, a small one in the gate, well looking out upon the barnyard, and the other a very small skylight reached by a sort of fixed step ladder from the attic floor. As soon as mother heard the animals claws on the side of the house, she thought of the skylight and cried to Susan to shut it. The skylight had an outer shutter of wood, which was closed in wintertime, to keep the heavy snowfall from breaking the glass. This shutter was now thrown back upon the roof, and the inner sash was raised a few inches for the sake of ventilation. Susan, fairly flew up the ladder and pulled out the little stick that supported the sash. She had barely got the hook slipped into the staple when the panther's round head and big light eyes appeared within a foot of her face. She gave a startled shriek and fell down the ladder. At this juncture, the two women gave themselves out for lost, and mother seizing an old curtain pole, which lay among the attic lumber, prepared to sell my infant life at a pretty high figure. All escape from the attic was blocked by the articles they had so carefully wedged into the stairway. This it would take them some time to clear. They never imagined that so fierce a brood as the panther could be stopped by an ordinary sash in glass, however strong. But the Indian devil is wary, and this one was suspicious of the glass. When on attempting to put his head down through the skylight, he met with an obstacle where he did not see any, he thought he detected a trap. He sniffed all over each pain, stopping every moment to eye us angrily, then he scratched, but very gingerly, had the sash, and only tore away some splinters, the sash was stout and new. At last he thrust his muzzle over roughly against the pain, and his nose went through the glass. Susan sank in a heap while mother with deadly purpose, grasped her curtain pole, expecting instant attack. It was not to be so, however, for which the world is much to be congratulated. The panther cut his nose pretty severely on the broken glass, and shrank back snorling viciously. He was more than ever convinced that the skylight was a trap, and would not trust his muzzle again in the opening. Observing the beast's caution, mother plucked out the new hope. She remembered having read that lions and tigers were afraid of fire, and forthwith she hit on a truly brilliant expedient. Get up, Susan, she commanded, and be of some use. Go and light that lamp on your watch stand, and bring it to me. Susan obeyed with a lacriddy, attired by the thought that there was anything left to do. When the lamp was brought, mother laid the chimney aside, and turned up the wicks, so as to give a flaring smokey blaze, then she handed a lamp back to Susan. Take it, she said, and set it on the top of the ladder right under the broken pain. This was too much for poor Susan. Oh, I'd ask, and never, she went bird backing hastily out of her mistress's reach. Mother regarded her with withering scorn, then turned and looked at me, where I lay close behind her in a basket of old clothes. Asuring herself that the panther could not get me in her absence, she sees the lamp and marched up the ladder with it. The panther grouled most menacingly, and thrust his face down to the opening, but as the smoke and flame came under his nose, he snorled and drew back. On the very top most step did mother deposit the lamp, where it blazed right up through the broken pain. As she turned it down the ladder, the panther's claws were heard above the shingles, beating a reluctant retreat. In a moment or two, he was heard on the shed, and then mother opened the skylight, reached out, and clapped down the wooden shutter. Susan's courage revived. Now that the danger was over, mother picked me out of the basket, and gathered me again to her bosom while Susan began to speculate on what the panther would be up to next. On this point, she was not long left and out. In the corner of the barnyard was a pigpin, inhabited at the time by a pig three months old. Presently, the poor little pig set up a terrific squealing, and mother and Susan rushed to the cable window. As I have said before, this window commanded a view of the barnyard, the panther was on the roof of the pan, appearing down through the cracks, and scratching vigorously to gain an entrance. Baby had been denied him, but poor he was determined to have. The pig squealed in a way that mother trusted would alarm the neighborhood, and tried to hide himself in the straw from the reach of those pale, cruel eyes. At last, the panther quitted the roof and found the pan door. Here he paused a moment or two, suspecting another trap. Then finding nothing suspicious in, he glided, there was one terrific squeal, and all was still. I fancy mother and Susan both wept thinking how well the fate of the poor pigy might have been their own, and mine. For a long while, the two women kept watch at the window. At last, the panther reappeared, walking very lazily and licking his jobs. He glanced at the house in a good-natured fashion, as if he bore us no grudge, cleaned his great face with one paw, sniffed the air thoughtfully in various directions, and then made off towards the woods, and we knew that our pig went with him. When he was well out of sight, mother and Susan removed the barricades, and for silk the attic, you may be sure they fastened every window, kept a keen outlook, and went about their work in fear and trembling. When my father got home in the middle of the afternoon, he heard the story before he could unharnest the horse. Straight way, he set out again an organized hunting party among the neighbors. The party was armed with all sorts and conditions of weapons, but it bagged that panther before sundown whereby was my mother much consoled. And now, have I stuck to the fax, said Strandian, turning to quorum, and to my surprise you have responded the latter. Well, went on Strandian, unruffled, since the panthers got after me so early, it's not much cause for wonder if they've kept it up. At this moment a strange unearthly gurgling cry broke the night stillness, and we started involuntarily. There is one of my ancient enemies now, said Strandian, I'm sure to fall foul of him tomorrow, and one or the other of us will rule the day. Well, said Strandian, we all know what won't be Strandian. The story done, I rose and replenished the fire, while Magnes passed around a tin of hot coffee. A quipper will, threshing the summer dust, with his gold flail of song, was heard in a hillside thicket, and a quorum and cried, listen to him boys. No said Strandian, will now give our very best attention, while Sam tells us one of his old bear stories. Indeed said Sam, with an indignate sniff, I'll tell you one, I never told before, and a true one at that. Now, don't interrupt, for I intend to do it up in a somewhat literary fashion, to say the old man trouble in writing it down. Well, thank you kindly, said I, I was the official scribe of the party, and, familiarly known as the old man, or simply O. M. For short, bear versus Birchmark continued Sam, is the title of my narrative. It was on the upper waters of the Aramokto River, that the case of Bear versus Birch Bark was decided. Thither had Alachem and I, be taken ourselves in Arcanu, to kill Samora Mokto trout. The Aramokto is, for the most part, much less rapid than other trout rivers of New Brunswick. In fact, for long distances, its current is quite sluggish, a characteristic finely suited to our indelence of mood. Paddling quietly or appalling when the water was swift, we soon left behind us all traces of civilization. Instead of beautiful open meadowshors shaded with here and there, a mighty Elm or ash, we entered the ruggedest part of the original wilderness, where the soil was too bear and and stony, to tempt even a squatter, and where the banks were closed with dark himlocks to the water's edge. Sometimes these somber woods gave back a space and a wild confusion of many kinds of trees took their place. Pines, ash, birch, baswood, large shenbeach, mixed with fallen trunks and staring white boulders. Sometimes again, in the midst of the most impenetrable forest, a delightful little patch of interval or dry waterside meadow, would open up before us, inviting us to pitch our tent amid its deep soft grasses. Scattered through the grass were clumps of tall wild lilies, their orange blossoms glowing amid the green, and around the stately heads of the wild parsnips which made the air heavy with rich perfume, fluttered and clung the silver-throated bobble links. What wonder we rested when we came to these wilderness gardens, whose possession there was none to dispute with us. We found that as a rule we might count upon a nice cold-brook nearby. Whatever such brooks flowed in, there would be a deep pool or an eddy covered with foam clusters, or a pebbly musical rapid, which meant a day of activity for our rods and reels and flies. One day after such a morning with the trout, as had left our wrists well-tired, we were inclined to give our rods a resting spell. The afternoon was sultry and drowsy, it was toward the close of July, and Alex' highest ambition was to take a long cesta in the tent floor, where an overhanging beach tree kept off the sun, and a sweet breeze seemed to have established its headquarters. There was no wind elsewhere that I could perceive, yet around our tent a soft breath of it was wandering all the day. For my part I didn't feel like loafing or lotus eating. The fever for specimens was upon me. I have an intermittent passion, as you know, for the various branches of natural history, and I'm given at times to collecting birds and plants and insects. This afternoon I had visions of a gorgeous butterflies, a rare feathered fall, and various other strangely lovely things, thronging my brain, so I put into the canoe my gauze net and double-barled breech-loader, and set off upstream in a vague search after some novelty. Let me confess it, my taste was destined to be gratified beyond my oats. Above our camping ground, the river for some distance was swift and deep. Beyond this, it widened out and became almost as motionless as a lake. Along these still reaches, the shores were comparatively low, and less heavily wooded, with here and there a little corner of Meadow, a bit of wet-marge covered with cat-tail flags, or a dense fragrant thick out of Indian willow. There were water lily leaves and broad patches right across the stream, and the air was gay with green and purple dragonflies, which lit on my gun-o and littered in a sun like jewels. There was not even a rustle of leaves to break the silence. At last, as I noiselessly rounded a low bushy point, right ahead I saw a splendid blue airon, which was watching intently for menows in the shallow water. He spread his broad wings and rose instantly. I had just time to let him have one barrel as he disappeared over a thick of holders, flying so low that as long legs swept their tops. I felt certain I had hit him for straight away a rose a great crackling and struggling, among the bushes beyond. In my haste I failed to notice that this disturbance was rather too violent to be proceeding from any wounded bird, unless it were a dodo. Running my birch ashore alongside of a moldering trunk, which had fallen with half its length in the stream, I made my way gun-in-hand through the underwood, without stopping to load my empty barrel. There was no sign of blue herons where my bird was supposed to fall in, but to my unlimited astonishment I beheld a black bear cub making off at his very best speed badly scared. At my sudden appearance he gave a curious bleet of alarm and redoubled his efforts to escape. He had little cause for alarm however as I did not want him for a specimen, and had I wanted him ever so much I could not well aback them with no heavier ammunition than birdshot. I was watching his flight with a sort of sympathetic amusement, when with the most disagreeable suddenness and completeness the tables were turned upon me. In the underbrush behind me I heard a mighty crashing, and there to my dismay was the old she bear in a fine rage rushing to the rescue of her offspring. Considering that the offspring's peril was not immediate, I thought she need not have been in such a tremendous hurry. She had cut off my retreat. She was directly in the line of my sole refuge, my faithful and tried birdch bark. There was no time left for meditation. I darted a straight toward the enemy. Undounted by this boldness she rose upon her hind legs to give me a fitting reception. When almost within her reach I fired my charge of birdshot right in her face, which not naturally seemed somewhat to confuse her for a moment. It was a moment's diversion in my favor. I made the most of it. I dashed past and had gained some paces toward the canoe when my adversary was again in full chase, more furious than ever. As I reach the canoe she sprang on the other end of the log and was almost a board of me, or I could seize the paddle and thrust out. Fortunately I had headed downstream for the maddabrewed took to the water without hesitation. Had the stream been deep I should merely have laughed at this, but in these shallows it was no laughing matter. The channel was deep enough to impede the bear's running, but by no means to make running impossible. I felt that the question of speed between us was now a painfully doubtful one. My back bent to the paddle, the broad blade flashed through the water with all the force and swiftness I was master of. Close behind, though I could not spare time to look back, I could hear the animal plunging in pursuit, and I was drenched with the spray of her splashings. I was a skillful canoeist, I have won many races, but never was another canoe race I was so bent upon winning as this one. At last snatching a glance over my shoulder, I saw that I had gained, though, but slightly. It was well I had, for the tremendous pace was one which I could to keep up no longer. I knew the deep water was still far ahead, and I knew too the obstinacy and tireless strength of my pursuer. There was therefore a grave uncertainty in my mind as to whether I could succeed in holding the lead much longer. I slackened a little, saving my strength all I could, but the bear had once made up her lost ground, and my breathing space was brief. At a little short of my best, but still at a killing pace enough, I found I could keep out of reach, but if a shoulder to come in the way or a sunken log or any like obstruction, the game was up. With this chance in view I had little leisure for watching my pursuer's progress. I could hear however, and feel quite too much of it. After what seemed an age of this desperate racing, we came to a part of the stream where I expected a change in my favor. For a quarter of a mile, I would have a fair current in a narrower and deeper channel. Here I gained ground at once. I relaxed my efforts a good deal, gave my aching arms a moment's rest, and watched the angry bear while owing clumsily after me, able now neither to run nor swim. This ended the matter, I fondly imagined, and I drew alongside a relief. But I was far yet from being out of the wood. I had begun too, hello, too soon. When the bear saw that I was about to escape, she took to the land, which just here was fairly open and unobstructed, and to my horror she came bounding after me along the water's edge at a rate which I could not hope to rival. But in the pause I had recovered my breath in my strength. I shot onward and my antagonist had a hard gallop before she overhealed me. I could mark now every bound of her great black form, the sharp chattering laugh of a king fisher startled me, and I noticed the bird fly off downstream in dignity. How I wished I might borrow his wings. Just then the bear having got a little in advance of me, spraying from midstream, so sagatiously timing her effort that had I kept on, she must inevitably have seized or upset me. But it was this I was on the watch for. In the nick of time I backed water with all my might, swirled aside, and darted past close behind her, so close that I could have clutched her shaggy hindquarters. I had no special reason for attempting this feat however, so I sped on. And now began a second stretch of sholes. For the next half mile it was much the same old story, say that I had gained a better start. There was one little variation however, which came near making an end of the whole affair. In rounding a sharp turn I did just what I had been dreading ran aground. It was only on the skirts of a sloping shoal, and I was off again before I had time to think, but the distance between pursuers and pursuers had grown painfully less in that moment. I could all but feel the animals hot breath upon the back of my neck. The strain was terrible, but soon I began to take heart again, I thought to myself that surely I could hold out till clear of these last shallows, and after that I knew the shores were such as might be expected to baffle even this most indomitable of bears. When again we reached deep water, I was paddling as blended stroke, and the bear, apparently as fresh and as wrathful as ever, was floundering along, perhaps, to canoe links in the rear. By this time the camp was in sight, a good half my off. I saw Alec come lazily out of the tent, take a glance at the situation, and dart back again. Gun and hand he reappeared and ran up the shore to meet us. Feeling that now I had matters pretty well in my own way, I waved him back, so he took his stand on the summit of a precipitous bluff, and awaited his chance for a shot. As soon as the bear found herself again compelled to swim, with a snort and a growl she turned sureward to repeat her former maneuver, she took the opposite shore to that occupied by Alec. The banks were steep and crumbly, closed along top with bushes and fallen trees and rocks, and a tangle of wild vines, yet the unwary to brute managed to overcome these difficulties by her stupendous strength, and actually outstripped me once more. It was all she could accomplish, however, and just as she sprang for the canoe, the edge of the bank gave way beneath her weight, and in an avalanche of stones and the loose earth she rolled head over heels into the river. I was far away before she could recover herself. I saw she was utterly disgusted with a whole thing. She clambered a shore, and on the top of the bank stood estupeedly gazing after me. Then I laughed and laughed till my overstrained size were near bursting. I could hear peels of earth from Alec at his post on the bluff, and was calmed at last by a fear, less his convulsions might do him some injury. Reaching the landing place, I only waited to pull the canoe's nose up onto the grass, then through myself down, quite exhausted. A moment later, the bear gave herself a mighty shaking, and accepting her defeat moved solvently back upstream. As Sam concluded, Strenion rose and agraively shook him by the hand. I congratulate you on winning your case, said he, and now, being first knight out, let's all turn in, or will be fagged tomorrow. It is hard to get to sleep the first night in camp, and I was awake for an hour, after all the rest were snoring. I lay listening to the soft confusion of night sounds, till at last the liquid-gabble of a shallow below the camp, faded into an echo of cathedral bells, and while I was yet wondering at the change, I found the morning sun in my face, and saw Strenion holding out a tin of hot coffee. I sprang up and found myself the lager of the crowd. Come to breakfast, quite Strenion, lunches here, and it's time we were over the portage. Tom Lynch was a lumberman whom we had engaged by letter to come with his team and drag, and Hallar canoes over to Mud Lake. His team was a yoke of half-wild, brindle steers. The portage was five miles long, the way an unverrying succession of ruts, mud holes, and stumps, and Mr. Lynch's vocabulary, like his temper, was exceedingly vivacious. Yet the journey was accomplished by the middle of the afternoon, and with no bones broken. The flies and mosquitoes were swarming, but we inflicted upon them, or crushing defeat, by the potent aid of us, Litheru. This magic fluid consists of Stockholm, Tarr, and Tallow, spiced with penny royal, and boiled to about the consistency of treacle. It will almost keep a grizzly at bay. By half past three in the afternoon, we were launched upon the unenchanting bosom of Mud Lake, upon perhaps three miles-incer conference, weedy, and swarming with leeches. It hardly exceed two feet in apparent depth, but its bottom is a fathomless slime stirred up vile, yet every dip of the paddle. Its low marshy shores, French here and there, with dead bushes, and tall, charged trunks, afforded us, but one little bit of beauty, the green and living corner where bird-sleece broke, flows out. At this season, the broke was very shallow, so that we had often to wait beside the canoes, and ease them over the shallows. And now, Sam did a heroic thing. He volunteered to let the rest of us do the work, while he waited on a head to catch some trout for supper. It was by no means unpleasant, waiting down this bright and rippling stream, whose banks were lovely with overhanging trees, through which the sunlight came deliciously tempered. Times slipped by as sweetly as the stream, but a little surprise was in store for us. We were descending a beautiful, older, French-doreach, when around a bend below us appeared Sam with undignified impetuousity. He struggled toward us, knee-deep in the current, dashing up the spray before him, his eyes as wide as saucers, up air, up air, he gasped, and hurling down his rod and fish in the canoe, he seized a heavy revolver. We had grasped our weapons precipitantly and halted, but Sam urged us on, leading the way. As thus, full-armed, we pressed forward downstream. He told us in a suppressed voice how, as he angled and meditated, and there was no sound save the hush tumult of a little rapid, or the recurrent switch of his line. Suddenly from the bank behind him rose the angry blatant grower, which he knew for the utterance of a shebear with cubs. At this, he had felt indignant and startled, and with a terrific yell, had hurled a stone into the bushes as a hint that he was a bad man and not to be tripled with. Thereupon had a risen aurora which put his yel to shame. The undergrowth had rocked and crashed with the swift approach of the monster, and filled with penitential misgivings he had made haste to flee. When we reached the scene of the possible tragedy, however, the bear or bears had disappeared. We grieved not greatly for their absence, and of chapter 1.","Action & Adventure Fiction, Nature & Animal Fiction, Short Stories",English,08:17:11,David Wales,"['Strandian', 'Indians', 'French', 'Strenian', 'Panthers', 'Stranian', 'Indian', 'canoe']","['Frederick 10', 'Maruasca', 'Strenian', 'Squatook', 'Charles Roberts', 'Birch Bark', 'Alec', 'Bert', 'Aramokto', 'Elm', 'Alex', 'Sam Ranoff', 'Strandian', 'Sam', 'log cabin', 'Guirman', 'David Wales', 'Quirman', 'Thither', 'O.

Principles of Political Economy,John Stuart Mill; J. Laurence Laughlin,75293,5.0,"December 25, 2018",[],0,"visit Librevox.org Recording by Aaron Rivera Principles of Political Economy by John Stuart Mills, a bridge by J. Lawrence Lawflin Preface An experience of five years with Mr. Mills treatise in the classroom not only convinced me of the great usefulness of what still remains one of the most lucid and systematic books yet published, which covers the whole range of the study. But I have also been convinced of the need of such additions as should give the results of later thinking, without militating against the general tenor of Mr. Mills system. Of such illustrations, I should fit it better for American students by turning their attention to the application of principles in the facts around us, of a big biography which should make it easier to get at the radars of other schools who offer opposing views on contributed systems, and have some attempts to lighten those parts of his work, in which Mr. Mills frightened away the reader by an appearance of two great abstractness. And to render them, if possible, more easy of comprehension to the student who first approaches political economy through this author. Believing also that the mission of much that should properly be classened to the head of sociology or social philosophy would narrow the field to political economy alone and aid, perhaps, and clear ideas. It was led to reduce the two volumes into one. With, of course, the additional hope that the smaller book would tempt some readers who might hesitate to attack his larger work. In consonants with the above plan, I have a bridge Mr. Mills treat us. It have always retained his own words, although it should be said that they are not always his consecutive words. Everything in the larger type on the pages taken literally from Mr. Mills, and whenever it has been necessary to use a word to complete the sense, it has been always inserted in square brackets. All additional matter introduced by me has been printed in a smaller but distinctive type. The reader can see it a glance which part of the page is Mr. Mills and which my own. It has seen necessary to make the most additions to the original treaties under the subjects of the wage question of wages of superintendents, of socialism, of cost of production, of by-metalism, of the paper money experiments in this country, of international values, of the future of the laboring classes in which the chapter was entirely rewritten, and of the protection. The treatment of land tenures has not been entirely omitted, but it does not appear as a separate subject because it has it present less value as an elementary study for American students. The chapters on land tenures, the English currency discussion, and much of book five on the influence of government, have been simply omitted. In one case, I have changed the order of the chapters by inserting chapter 15 of book three, treating of a standard value under the chapter treating of money and its functions, and other respects the same order has been followed as in the original work. Whenever it has seen possible, American illustrations have been inserted instead of the English or continental ones. To interest the reader in home problems, 24 charts have been scattered throughout the volume, which bear upon our own conditions. With the expectation also, the different methods of graphic representation have been presented would lead students to apply them to other questions. They are mainly such as I've employed in my classroom. The use in preparation such charts ought to be encouraged. The earlier pages of the volume have been given up to a sketch of the history of political economy, which aims to give the story of how we have arrived at our present knowledge of economic laws. The student who has completed mill will then have a very considerable bibliography of the various schools and writers from which to select further reading, and to select this reading so that it may not fall wholly within the range of one class of writers. But, for the time that mill is being first studied, I've added a list of the most important books for consultation. I've also collected in Appendix 1, some brief bibliographies on the tariff on bi-mentalism, and on American shipping, which may be of use for those who do not have the means of inquiring for authorities and in Appendix 2, a number of questions and problems for the teachers use. In some cases, I have admitted Mr. Mill's statement entirely and put in, and instead, a simpler form of the same exposition which I believe would be more easily grasped by a student. Of such cases, the argument to show that demand for commodities is not demand for labor. The doctrine of international values and the effect of the progressives society on wages, profits and rent are example. Whether I have succeeded or not, must be left for the experience of the teacher to determine. Many small figures and diagrams have been used throughout the text in order to suggest the concrete means of getting a clear grasp of a principle. In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to several friends for assistance in preparation of this volume. Among whom are Professor Charles F. Dunbar, Dr. F. W. Towsick, Dr. A. B. Hart, and Mr. Edward Atkinson. J. Lawrence Lawflon, Harvard University Cambridge Master Chutes, September 1884.

Mark Twain,Archibald Henderson,209280,4.0,"February 25, 2018",[],0,"ding by John Greenman. Mark Twain by Archibald Henderson. Happily, who knows somewhere in Avalon, Isle or Dreams, in vast contentment at last, With every grief done away, while Chaucer and Shakespeare wait, And Mollier hangs on his words, And Servantes, not far off, listens and smiles apart, With that incomparable draw, he is justing with Dagonet now. Bliss, Carmen. Preface. There are today all over the world, Men and women and children who owe a dead of almost personal gratitude To Mark Twain, for the joy of his humor and the charm of his personality. In the future they will, I doubt not, seek and welcome opportunities To acknowledge that dead. My own experience with the works of Mark Twain is in no sense exceptional. From the days of early childhood, my feeling for Mark Twain Derived first, solely from acquaintance with his works, was a feeling of warm And, as it were, personal affection. With limitless interest and curiosity, I used to hear the uncle-remus stories From the lips of one of our old family servants, A Negro to whom I was devotedly attached. These stories were narrated to me in the Negro dialect With such perfect naturalness and racial gusto, but I often secretly wondered If the narrator were not uncle-remus himself in disguise. I was thus cunningly prepared, coached, shall I say, For the mature charms of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. With uncle-remus and Mark Twain as my preseptors, I spent the days of my youth, excitedly alternating spellbound Between the inexhaustible attractions of Tom, Huck, Jim, Indian Joe, The Duke and the Dolphin, and their Compears on the one hand, And Bray Rabbit, Sis Cow, and a thousand other fantastic, But very real creatures of the animal kingdom on the other. I felt a strange sort of camaraderie of personal attachment For Mark Twain during all the years before I came into personal contact with him. It was the dictum of a distinguished English critic To the effect that Huckleberry Finn was a literary masterpiece Which, first of woken me, then a mere boy, A genuine respect for literary criticism. For here was expressed an opinion which I had long secretly cherished, But somehow never dared to utter. My personal association with Mr. Clemens, comparatively brief though it was, An ocean voyage, meetings here and there, a brief stay as a guest in his home. Dave me at last, the justification for paying the debt, which, With the years, had grown greater and more insistently obligatory. I felt both relief and pleasure when he authorized me to pay that debt By writing an interpretation of his life and work. It is an appreciation originating in the heart of one who loved Mark Twain's works For a generation before he ever met Samuel L. Clemens. It is an interpretation springing from the conviction that Mark Twain was a great American Who comprehensively incorporated and realized his own country and his own age As no American has so completely done before him. A supreme humorist, whoever wore the panache of youth, gayety, and bono me. A brilliant wit who never dipped his darts in the poison of cynicism, Messanthropy, or despair. Constitutually a reformer who heedless of self boldly struck for the right As he saw it. A philosopher and sociologist who intuitively understood the secret Springs of human motive and impulse, and empirically demonstrated that Intuition in works which crossed frontiers, survived translation, and went straight To the human beneath the disguise of the racial, a genius who lived to know and enjoy The happy rewards of his own fame, a great man who saw life steadily and saw it whole.

Old Testament Legends Being Stories Out Of Some Of The Less-Known Apocryphal Books Of The Old Testament,M. R. James,17189,6.0,"November 25, 2018",['\n        Solomon built the Temple using Demons??? Who knew??? Interesting book and a Good Reader. Thanks!      '],1,"ord's are in the public domain, for more information or to volunteer. Please visit libravox.org, recording by David Wales, Preface of Old Testament legends of I.M.R. James. If you read the title page of this book, a thing which young persons very seldom do, you will see that, yet, at the book, contains stories taken out of some of the less known apocryphal books of the Old Testament, you will very possibly not understand what that means, but if you will read this preface, another thing, which young persons do even seldomer, then they read a title page, you will find the best explanation that I can give. I have to begin by talking about the word apocryphal. The newspapers are fond of saying that a statement made by the Prime Minister, or the leader of the opposition, according to which side in politics the newspaper takes, is apocryphal. By this, the newspaper means to say that the statement was untrue, or you will read that someone obtained money or goods by saying that he possessed larger states of bronze and that the estate turned out to be apocryphal. By this, his meant that they did not exist, but when you read of a book being apocryphal, something rather different is meant, either that it is spurious, i.e. that it pretends to be written, by someone who did not write it, or that what is in it is fabulous and untrue, like the stories of King Arthur, or both. Now, this word apocryphal is specially used and perhaps most often used in connection with the Bible. Probably you have at least heard of something called the apocrypha, even if you have not read it, and even if you have mixed it up in your mind with another word, apocrylets, which has nothing whatever to do with it. Well, what is the apocrypha? It is to be found in many Bibles, bound out between the old and new testimonets. It is a set of books, looking just like the other books of the Bible, with chapters and verses. Some of it is read in Church as weekday lessons in the months of October and November, as you may see by looking at the table of lessons in any prayer book. Now, are all these books of the apocrypha, fabulous or spurious? No. Some of them are. The second book of Ezres, that is Ezra, was not written by Ezra. The book of Baruch, the companion of the prophet Jeremiah, was not written by Baruch. The wisdom of Solomon was not written by Solomon. These and some others are spurious. Also, the books of Tohwood and of Judith are fabulous stories. On the other hand, the book of Ecclesiasticus was really written by Syrac, who is mentioned in the preface, and the first book of Macabees is a true and valuable history. Then why, if apocryphal means fabulous or spurious, or both, are these books, some of which are true in genuine, lumped altogether and called apocrypha? I am sorry to disappoint you, but I cannot go through the whole history. It is long, it is difficult, and though it interest me, I am inclined to think it would not interest you unless I spread it over a great many pages and filled it out with stories, and for this I have no time. Let me tell you what strikes me as being the important thing to bear in mind. Nearly all of these books have been at some time or another, read in church, and treated it as scripture. Nearly all of them are now treated as scripture by the Roman Church, but not by most of the Protestant or reformed churches. They are on the borderland of the Bible, from having been so long kept together and a group by themselves, they have come to be thought of as being all of one uniform kind, but they are not so. They are very different sorts and merits. Let us keep the old name for them and call them the apocrypha. It will be convenient to do so, because I have now to speak of other apocryphal books, which have never been bound up in our Bibles, but in older times before Bibles were printed, were some of them at least read in churches and thought to be sacred books. There are great many of these, perhaps if they were all put together, they would make up a volume as large as the Old Testament itself, but at present there is no book in which they are all printed together. Some are stories, others are visions like those of the revelation of St. John. Others are songs and prophecies, but all of them I think may fairly be called either fabulous or spurious, or both. I can give you an example from the Bible itself to show you that there were such books as long ago as the times of the apostles and that they were read and valued. In the ninth verse of the episode of Jude, you read something very curious about Satan, contending with Michael about the body of Moses. Ancient writers, whom we may trust, tell us that this is taken from a book called The Assumption of Moses. That is the story of Moses being taken about of this world at the end of his life. We have pieces of this book still, but we have not got the whole story of the dispute between Satan and Michael. However, we know that it was represented as having taken place when Michael and the other angels were burying the body of Moses among the mountains in a place which was kept secret from all men, and that Satan said that though the soul of Moses might belong to God, the body belonged to him, and moreover that Moses was a murderer because long before he had killed any gypsies as we read in Exodus 212. Whereupon Michael answered Satan in the words, the Lord, repuked the, and Satan, fled. That is one example. Another is in the 14th verse of the same episode where it is said that Enek, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of the coming of the Lord, to judge sinners. This verse is taken out of a long book of prophecies and visions called the book of Enek which still exists, and we may read the very words in it. In this present book, I am only concerned with the apocryphal stories, with the prophecies and visions and songs, I have nothing to do. Now, how and why did the stories come to be written? It is likely enough that after reading some history in the Bible, you may have wondered whether there was anything more to be known about the people of whom it told you. You would have liked to find out what happened to Adam or Joseph or David besides the things which are written in the Bible. It was just so in ancient times, the times when our Lord was on earth and even long before that. The Jews naturally thought a great deal about the people who were mentioned in the Old Testament, and just as there are great many stories about the heroes of English history, such as that of King Alfred and the cakes, which we are told now are not true, so stories grew up about the great men of the Bible. Perhaps they were invented, some of them, in answer to questions which had been asked. Some of them were certainly made up in order to explain parts of the Bible, which were difficult to understand. I will give an example of this. In the book of Genesis 4, 23 through 24, you are told how the patriarchal I spoke to as wise and said, I have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my earth. Nothing is said in explanation of this, we are not told whom Lamek had killed, so a story was made up, no one knows when, which gives this explanation. Lamek was blind and he used to amuse himself by shooting birds and beasts with bow and arrow. When he went out shooting, he used to take with him his young nephew, Tubal, and Tubal used to spy the game for him and guide his hands that he might aim his arrow right. One day when they were out together, Tubal saw as he thought a beast moving in the thicket and he told Lamek and made him aim at it and Lamek's arrow smoked the beast and killed it. But when Tubal ran to see what kind of beast it was, he found that it was not a wild beast at all, it was his ancestor King. For after King had killed Abel and God had pronounced a curse upon him, he wandered about the earth, never able to remain in one place, and a great horn grew out of his head, and his body was covered with hair, so that Tubal, saying him in the distance among the trunks of the trees in the brush wood, was deceived and mistook him for a beast of chase. But when Tubal saw what had happened, he was terrified and ran back to Lamek crying out, you have slain our forefather, King, and Lamek also was struck with horror, and raced his hands and smoked them together with a mighty blow. And in so doing, he struck the head of Tubal with his full strength, and Tubal fell down dead. Then Lamek returned to his house and spoke to his wise, the words that are written in the book of Genesis. This story, a very ancient one, as I said, was invented by the Jews to explain the difficult passage in Genesis, and the early Christian writers learned it from the Jews, and had passed into many commentaries which were written in later times, so that you may still see representations of it carved in stone, and churches both in England, and elsewhere. In England, it may be seen on the inside of the stone roof of Norwich Cathedral, and on the west front of Wells Cathedral, but you have to look carefully before you can find it. There are other stories which pretend to explain texts that do not seem so difficult. For instance, in the 18th Psalm, there is a verse that has made room enough underneath for to go. And about this, there is a long tale of how King David went to fight the giant Ish binabab, and it was nearly killed by him. For the giant took David and cast him to the ground and put a heavy wine press upon him, which would have crushed him, but that the earth beneath him, a sudden they became soft and yielding room for his body, and thus room was made under him. Then again, there are others which are like parables. At this point, I will put in to short stories of the parable kind, neither of which I think you are likely to have seen. One of them is certainly taken from Anna Parker for Book which is lost, and the other I suspect do have been taken, either from the same book or from one like it. First, I will tell you the one about the source of which I am not certain. In the days of King Hezekiah, there was in Israel, the rich man, who was a miser and gave nothing to the poor. But one day it happened that he took up the book of the Proverbs of King Solomon and his eye fell upon the place where it is said, he that have pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord, and look what he layeth out, it shall be paid him again. So thought he to himself, this is a good security, and forthwith he sold all that he had and distributed the price among the poor, keeping for himself only two pieces of money. But to his disappointment, he did not only become poor himself by this means, but he remained poor. The money he had given away did not come back and no one else would give him any. So he was reduced to despair and said, I will go straight to Jerusalem and demand of God why he has deceived me and induced me to give away all my possessions by promises that are false. And he said forth and on his way, not far from Jerusalem, he saw two men fighting and said to them, brethren, what is your quarrel? And one said, we were journeying together and I saw a shining stone lying on the road and pointed it out to this man, and because he was swift around his feet than I, he got to it first. And now he says he will keep it for himself. But I say it belongs to me for I saw it first. Then said the traveler, what is the value of the stone? They said, we do not know, and he said, will you take these two pieces of money for it and let me have it? And to this, they consented. So when the man got to Jerusalem, he took the stone to a jeweler and showed it to him. And no sooner had the jeweler seen it than he fell on his face and gave thanks to God. And then he said to the man, where did you find this? For three whole years, all Jerusalem has been ransacked for this stone. Go quickly to the high priest and give it to him and see what he will give you. At the same hour, there came an angel to the high priest and said to him, within a few moments there will come to you a man bringing the gem which three years ago was lost out of the breastplate of Aaron the priest, receive it at his hands and give him for it a great sum of gold. And when you have given it, smite him lightly upon the cheek and say, be not distrustful and die hard and slow to believe the word which says, he that had pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord. For thus, sayeth the Lord, have I not now, and this present world repaid them anytime over that which thou did slend to me. And if thou have faith thou shout in the world to come, receive a recompense yet many times greater than this. And when the man came, the high priest did and said as he had been commanded, and the man's heart was moved, and he left in the temple all that great sum which had been given him, and for the rest of his life put his whole trust in the promises of God. The other story is taken out of an apographer will come to the name of the prophet is E.K. and is a parable of the soul and the body of a man at the day of judgment. There was a certain king, it says, who made a marriage feast for his eldest son and invited all his soldiers to his palace to share it. Now, every one of his subjects was a soul-dure and served in his army except only two, one of whom was blind and the other lame, and these two were not invited to the feast but remained in their huts which were near to one another, very angry and disappointed. After a while the blind man called to the lame man, it is a shame that we are not sitting down to the feast along with the rest. I should like to treat the king as ill as he has treated us. How can we, said the lame man, you know his garden, said the other, let us go and spoil it. All very well said the lame man, but how are we to get there? I cannot walk. Neither can I see, but we will contrive away. So they devised a plan. The lame man applied the grass that he could reach and plated it into a string and threw one end to the blind man who guided himself by it to the lame man. Then he took the lame man on his back and carried him to the king's garden and there they did all the mischief they could crampling down and tearing up plants and flowers and they went back to their houses and remained there. When the rest of the people came out from the banquet into the garden they were upholed at the side of the damage and were much perplexed saying, we are not all the soldiers of the king bid into the feast and is not every man in the kingdom of soldier. Once then are these tracks in the garden and who has wrought this mischief. After a while the king thought him of the blind and the lame man they were brought before him and he said to the blind man, have you been into my garden?"" He answered, a last sigh, you see my infirmity and that I have no eyes were with to find my way. Then said the king to the lame man and you have you been into my garden. And he answered, surely my Lord is forgotten, my infirmity, it cannot be that he desires to hurt my feelings by mocking me. So the king was perplexed and went apart to consider how the two could have contrived the business for you was sure that they were guilty. At last a thought came to him and he said the lame man on the blind man's shoulders and scurred them both together. Then indeed did they cry out and the lame said to the blind, did you not lend me your feet to take me to the king's garden and the blind to the lame? Did you not lend me your eyes to show me the way? And in like matter at the judgment the soul will say to the body, I could not have sinned if you had not given me the limbs with which I did evil and the body to the soul but it was you who thought of evil which I carried out. Thus one will try to throw the blame on the other but is either of them free from guilt. Others of these apocryphal books are designed to show how important some special virtue or how dangerous some particular sin may be. Thus there is a book called the Testaments or last words of the twelve papriarchs in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob when he comes to die calls his children to him and tells them about his own life and warns them against his own besetting sin or shows how he has been helped by practicing some good habit. Simmy and speaks about envy, is a car about simplicity, zebulous about kindness and so on. And many others there are which are merely one would say, meant to tell us more about the lives and deaths of the great men of the old times than we can learn from the Bible. Perhaps I have now said enough to show of what sort the tales are that are told in this book, some of them told for the first time in English. They are not true but they are very old. Some of them I think are beautiful and all of them seem to me interesting. In case anyone should wish to know more about them, I will put down here the names of the books from which I have taken them. The first part of the story of Adam is shortened from Mr. S. G. Maylens translation of the book of Adam and Eve and from Dilma's German translation of the same, thus Christlicechia, Alem Buc, Des Morgan Mondes, the second part is from the Greek revelation of Moses in attition dors Apocalypseus Apakrafai and from the Latin life of Adam, edited by W. Meyer. The first part of the story of Abraham is from the Apocalypse of Abraham translated from Slabonic by Professor Inne Bonwetch. The second part is from the Testament of Abraham, edited by me, in texts and studies. The story of Asyneth is from the Greek history of Asyneth, edited by Badafoul in H.2.D. Apatristika. The story of Job is taken from the Testament of Job in my Apakrafai and Adota II. That of Solomon is from the Testament of Solomon as printed by Mignet at the end of the works of Michael Celis. That of Baruch from the rest of the words of Baruch edited by Dr. J. Rendo Harris. That of Ahikar, principally from the French addition by the Abbey of Now with some few touches borrowed from that by Dr. J. Rendo Harris. One last word, not all of the stories in this book are equally old. The oldest is most likely that of Ahikar. Lately some pieces of it have been discovered in Egypt in a very ancient copy. Next probably comes the second part of the story of Adam. In each of the others there are some parts which are derived from early Jewish tales but the books in which we have them now were put into their present shape by Christians. Still there is not one that is less than 1500 years old.

The Crimson Gardenia And Other Tales Of Adventure,Rex Beach,148600,2.0,"January 25, 2018",[],0,"volunteer, please visit libravox.org recording by David Wales. The Crimson Cardinia and other tales of adventure by Rex Beach. Story 1 The Crimson Cardinia Part 1 The Royal Yacht had anchored a mid-a-thunder of canon and the King had gone ashore. The city was bright with bunting, a thousand whistles blew. Up through the festooned streets his majesty was escorted between long rows of blue-coded officers behind which the eager crowds were massed for mile upon mile. Then wire cables were stretched along the curbs to hold the people back, but these threatened is not before the weight of the multitude. In the neighborhood of the raised pavilion where the queen and her maids of honor waited, the press was thickest. Here rows of stands had been erected that groaned beneath their freight while rooftops and windows, trees and telegraph poles were black with clustered humanity. The king was tall and dark, a long beard hit his face, but the queen was young and blushing, and her waiting women were fairer than spring-time flowers. To a crashing martial air she handed him a sparkling goblet, in which he pledged her happiness while the street rocked to the roar of many voices, and in the open spaces youths grow testily costume danced with goblin glee. Mr. Roland van Damme secretly thought it all quite fine and inspiring, but he was too highly schooled to allow himself much emotion. He had been hard put to obtain seats and had succeeded only through the efforts of a friend the Duke of Cotton. Therefore he felt the members of his party might have shown at least a perfunctory appreciation, but they were not the appreciative kind, and their attitude was made plain by Elner Banamman's language words, how dull it's nothing like the carnival at knees and the people seemed very common. Her father was dozing uncomfortably, with his two lower chins tell Scroop into his billowing chest. Mrs. Banamman complained of the heat and the glare and predicted a headache for herself. Nearby the rest of the party were striving to conceal their lack of interest by gying the crowd below. Van Damme had been the one to suggest this trip to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras, and he felt the weight of entertainment bearing heavily upon him. In consequence, he assumed a sprightly interest that was very far from genuine. This sort of thing awakened something medieval inside of one, don't you know? He said, Miss Banamman regarded him with a bland lack of comprehension, and her mother moaned weekly at the burden of her complaint being, as usual, why did we leave Palm Beach? All those dukes and things make me feel as if it were real than Damme explained further. They say this Rex fellow is a true king during Mardi Gras week, and those taps and masts are quite like court gestures, maybe they sing of wars and love and romance and all that rot. I dare say life was just as uninteresting and old in times as it is now, Elana remark, love and romance exist mainly in books, I fancy. If they ever did exist, we've outgrown them, ah, Broly. Being a very rich and a very experienced young woman, Miss Banamman, apprited herself upon her lack of illusion. To be sure, she occasionally permitted Roland to kiss her in celebration of their engagement, but such caresses left her unperturbed. Her pulses had never been stirred. She looked upon marriage as a somewhat drawing, although necessary, institution. Banamman being equally modern and equally satiated by life's blessings, shared her beliefs in a vague way. Manifestly, a no lover could allow such an assertion as this to go unchallenged. So he rose to the defense of romance, only to hear her say, oh, nonsense, a dubious sense of role, such things aren't done nowadays. What things aren't done? All of those crude, primitive performances we read about in novels, nice people don't fall in love overnight, for instance, they don't allow themselves to hate and be jealous and to rage about, like wild animals anymore. The idea, your father is a perfect savage at heart, said Mrs. Banamman. She nodded at her sleeping husband, who was roused at that moment by a fly that straight into his right nostril. Mr. Banamman sneezed, half opened his eyes, and murmured a feeble enathema before dosing off again. It was plain that he was not greatly enjoying the Mardi-Gra. All men are primitive, said Raleigh, quoting some forgotten author, at which Eleanor I'd him languidly, could you love at first sight and run off with a girl? Certainly not, I'd naturally have to know something about her people. Were you ever jealous? You've never given me an occasion, he told her gallantly, did you ever hate anybody? No, have you been afraid? Not exactly, revengeful, certainly not. She smiled. It's just as I said, respectable people don't allow themselves to be harrowed by crude emotions. I hate my modest when she fails to fit me. I was jealous of that verineset de pońciana, the one with all those gorgeous gowns, I'm afraid of flying machines, but that is as deep as such things go nowadays in our set. Banamman was no hand at argument, and he had a great respect from his manaman's observation. However, he had been discussing something of which he possessed no first hand knowledge. Therefore, he said nothing further. No one had a great appreciation of or took a keener pleasure in, life's unruffled platsidity, than the young society man. No one had a denser ignorance of its depths, its hidden currents, and its uncharted jannels than he. For adventure had never come his way, romance had never back in him from rose-embowered balconies, and yet as the world goes, he was a normal individual, say for the size of his income. He had not lost interest in life, he was merely interested in things which did not matter. That, after all, is quite different. There were times nevertheless when he longed vaguely for something thrilling to happen. When he regretted the auslerization of romance and the commercializing of love. Of course, adventure still existed, one could hunt big game in certain hidden quarters if one chose. Banam detested stuffed heads, and it took so much time to get them. Those unfauchant desires came to him only now, and he felt ashamed of them in an idle way. Now that the parade had passed, the visitors lost no time in leaving, and a dignified stampede toward the hotel occurred, for the gentleman were thirsty and the ladies wished to smoke. It was due to their haste perhaps, the bandam became separated from them and found himself grifting along Canal Street alone in a densely packed crowd of merry-makers. A masked woman in a daring Spanish dress chucked him under the chin, her companion, shaward him with confetti, a laughing-peer-roll whacked him with a noisy bladder, boys and girls and ragged disguises, in portune ten for pennies. A very, very shapely female person, in what appeared to be the beginnings of a bathing suit, laughed over her shoulder, inviting him with eyes that danced. My word, murmured at the New Yorker, this is worthwhile. A head of him, he caught a glimpse of Miss Vanamun's a grits and the pondress figure of her father. But the gaity of the carnival crowd had infected him, and he was low to leave it for the green of old, with her his friends were bound with the unerring directness of thirsty millionaires. It was a brilliant gorgeous afternoon. The streets were alive with color. Somewhere, through this crowd, the young man idly reflected, at venture, even romance might be stalking, if such things really existed. So he decided to linger, to be quite truthful, Van Dam's decision was made, not within a faintest idea of encountering either romance or adventure, but because a slight indigestion made the thought of a gin-fiz or a julep unbearable at the moment. As he continued to move with the throng, the butt of bad in the ganda of the target for impudent glances, he felt a desire to be of it and in it. He yielded himself to a most indiscreet impulse. Assuring himself that he was unobserved, he stepped into a store, purchased a plain black domino and mask, dawned at him, and then fell in with the procession once more, dimly amused at his folly vaguely surprised at his impropriety. But now that he was one of the revelers, he was no longer an object of their attentions. They paid no heed to him, and he soon became bored. He engaged himself in conversation with an old flower woman, and as she had only a solitary guardian yel-left in her tray, he bought it in order that she might go home. He penned the blossom on the left breast of his domino, and wandered to the nearest corner to watch the crowds flow past. He had been there but a moment when a girl approached and stood beside him. She was petite, and yet her body beneath its fetching Norman costume showed the rounded lines of maturity. At the edge of her mask, her skin gleamed smooth and creamy, her eyes were very dark and very bright. As Mr. Van Dam was a very circumspect young man, not given to the slightest familiarity with strangers, he confined his attention to an inoffensive inventory of her charms, and was doubly startled to hear her murmur, you came in spite of all, Missier. A French girl he thought, no doubt one of those creoles he had heard so much about. A loud he said, with a bow, he has madame a zeal, I have been looking for someone like you. Her eyes flashed to the white gardener on his breast, then up to his own. You were expecting someone. I was a girl to guide me through the carnival, but you are early. Did you not perceive the warning? Warning he answered confused, I received no warning. I feared as much, she said, so I came, but it was unwise of you. It was madness to risk the streets. Her eyes left his face to scam the crowds. He fancied she shrank from them as if fearing observation. Van Dam was puzzled. Her voice and manner undoubtedly betrayed a genuine emotion, or else she was a consummate actress. If this were some mardi Gras prank, he felt a desire to see the next move. If it proved to be anything more, he fancied that he was too sophisticated to be caught and fleeced like a countryman. But something told him that this was no ordinary street flirtation. The words warning, risk seemed to promise entertainment. If, as he suspected, she had mistaken him for someone else, a brief masquerade could lead to no harm. He decided to see how far he could carry the deception. Oh, what warning could it serve to prevent my thieing you? He asked in a hollow voice, then was surprised at the flush that stole upward to the girls' dainty ear. You are indeed insane to gest at such a time. She breathed. I would never have known you without the flower, but come, we are in danger here. Someone is waiting. Will you follow me? To the ends of the earth he replied gallantly. Again, she gave him a startled glance, half of pleasure, half of deprecation. Then, as he made a movement to accompany her, she checked him, oh no, no, you must let me go ahead. They are everywhere. They may suspect even my disguise. I am dreadfully afraid. Then, damned, scarcely knew how to answer this. So, like a wise man, he held a ston. Listen, she continued. I will walk slowly and do you remain far enough behind for your own safety. My safety is as nothing to yours, he told her, but she shook her head impatiently. Please, please, they will never select you out of a thousand dominoes, and I am not sure they suspect me, but should they try to lift my mask you must escape at once? With it they dare, Mr. Van Damne inquired, shocked at such a breach of Carnival etiquette. They would dare anything, but I couldn't allow it really. He persisted. If any hand is to lift your mask, I insist that mine be the favored one. She darted a doubtful look at him, being plainly perturbed at his stone. Then, shook her head. She told me you were reckless, but you are quite insane. For a second time, he discovered that delicious color, tension, her neck, and laughed, which disconcertered her even more. She hesitated, then turned away, and he fell in beside her. But distance proved only to enhance the girl's charms. Rally saw how beautifully proportion she was, how regal as she carried herself, how light and springy was her step. Although he had not seen her face, he somehow felt agreeably certain that she possessed a witching beauty. The circumspection with which he avoided the densest crowds made him wonder a new at the character of the danger that could overhang a masked maiden at mid-afternoon on a carnival day. For by this time he had forgotten his first suspicion. He thought not at all that the peril could be serious or in any way involved him, for the magic of the Vandam name protected its owner like invisible male. The effect of that patternemic was really quite wonderful. Policeman bowed to it. I rate strangers allowed their anger to ooze away before it. It smoothed the owner's way through difficulties and brought him favors when least expected. Rage changed to civility. In Ignation, opposition, even jealousy, altered color in the shadow of the Vandam millions. Nothing really unpleasant ever happened to Rolly, and so it was that he had become blaze and attired at 26. He followed his masked guide across Canal Street and into the foreign quarter of the city, where the surroundings were unfamiliar to him. He gazed with mild repugnance at the squalid old houses, moldering behind their rusted iron balconies. Dem, flag-paved hallways, allowed him a glimpse of flowered courtyards at the rear. Cool passages went twisting in between the buildings. Over hard-baked, glaring walls, their drooped branches laden with bloom and fruit. The streets were narrow. The houses leaned intimately toward one another as if exchanging gossip. Little cafes with sanded floors opened upon the sidewalks. Here the carnival crowd was more foreign in character. People were dancing to orchestras of guitar and mandolin. Youth turned summer salts for pennies. Ragged Negroes, jigged and shuffled without stretched hats. Through this confusion, the Norman girl took her way, now seeking some deep doorway to allow a particularly boisterous group to pass, now flitting through the open spaces with the swift irregularity of a butterfly winging its course through sunlit stretches. But her caution, her bird-like backward glances, told a van damn that she was in constant dread of discovery and involuntarily he listened the distance between them. It was well perhaps that he did so, for just then a man in a domino like his own, a costed the girl. Rally saw his guide shrink away, saw her turn and signal him with a swift imperious gesture of warning. Instead of heating it, he moved forward in time to intercept the stranger. The fellow was laughing loudly. He assumed a tipsy air and lurched against the girl. Then with a quickness that belied his pose, he snatched at her mask and begged her features. She cried out in terror and with the sound of her voice, Mr. Bad Dam flew to action. He knew that until six o'clock disguises were in violet and that it was against the strictest of police regulations to unmask a reveler. Therefore he yielded to a righteous impulse and struck the man in the domino squarely upon the jaw. Beneathrawly it rounded proportions was a deceptive machinery of bone and muscle that had been schooled by the most expensive instructors of boxing. He had known how to hit cleanly since he was 12 years old, and although he had never struck a man in anger until this moment, his fist went true. The fellow rocked stiffly back upon his heels and fell like a wooden figure, his head thumping doly on the pavement and drawly gave an to a most un-juntal-manly snort of surprise and satisfaction. It had been easier than he had expected, and feeling that the man should have every opportunity for fair play, Rolly began promptly to count one, two, three, then he felt the girls hand upon his arm and turned in time to catch a fleeting glimpse of a dimpled chin as she drew her mask down. Rotten, trick that. Heaven above, she gasped, we must flee quickly. People were crossing the street toward them, drawn by the side of the fallen man, run away and leave you, Gwiridrolly. Hardly, then the breath caught in the girls throw. Come, she clutched his hand and they fled side by side, pursued by half a score of shouting Marymakers, around the first corner they scurried into a crowd, then out of it and into the next thoroughfare, doubling and turning until the girl's breath was gone. Why did you do it? Why? She gasped, still hurring him along, drunken loafer Van Dam said, then, dictively, he was not drunk. Don't you understand? Didn't you guess? It was the black wolf. Rolly did not understand, and he had no opportunity to guess who or what the black wolf might be, for his companion to pause, crying, God help us, they're coming from the street behind rose above all of angry voices. He saw me, he knows. She cast a despairing glance about and spying a narrow alley close at hand, darted toward it, dragging Van Dam with her. Retreat carries with it a peculiar panic, and the young man felt the stirring of an utterly new sensation within him. He was running away. What was more, he wanted to keep running, even though he had not the faintest idea of what menestim. It was quite remarkable. He seemed to feel for some unknown reason that this sprightly young person beside him was indeed risking her safety for him. Therefore he began to share her apprehension, but as to what it meant, or whether the adventure was leading, he had not a suspicion. He did wonder, however, where the black wolf got his name. The alley was damp and slippery, being a no more than a tunnel-like passage between two buildings, and it led into a large courtyard full of carts and wagons. A low shed ran along one side of the enclosure, at the rear was a two-story structure used as a stable. There, I guess we've given them a slip, Van Dam side with relief, but his companion, sugarhead, oh no, no, we must hide. The black wolf has the cunning of Satan, and now that he knows, she's fed through the confusion of vehicles to the stable door, with roly following. An instant more, and they were in an odorful, dimlit place, divided into stalls out of which the heads of several horses were thrust in friendly greeting. The girl closed the door and leaned panting against it, one hand to her heaving bosom. Her head was bowed, and her ears were strained for sounds of pursuit. In the silence, Van Dam heard his own heavy breathing, the swish of the horses' tails, and impatient, stirring of hooves, and a gentle winy. He discovered that his pulse was hammering in a very unusual manner, and that he was, agreeably, excited. The girl uttered an exclamation, oh, I feared so hurry. She slipped past him to a rickety stairway that led upward, ah, this mask is smothering me. She disengaged it hastily, and he saw it dangling in her hand, as he mounted the steep stairs behind her. He saw also a pair of dainty silken ankles, swelling into delicious curves that were hidden in the foamy whiteness of lingerie. Being an extremely respectful gentleman, Mr. Van Dam lowered his eyes, anticipating with curious eagerness, the pleasure of beholding her countenance once they had gained the loft. The desire to see behind her mask became really acute. He had missed one opportunity by so narrow a margin as to quicken his desires. They came out upon a rough landing, and Van Dam caught the whisker skirt, disappearing through a door that led into the amoe. As he followed, the door closed, and he found himself in utter darkness. He heard her fumbling with the lock. Their hands came together, as he turned a rusty key, and he felt her figure close against his, her fragrant breath, fan his G. Make no sound as you value our lives. As she whispered this, Van Dam swore mildly at the lock that prevented him from appraising his companions' good looks, now that her mask was off. From the courtyard below, sounded voices, the girl clutched him nervously, her hand was shaking, he could feel her shiver, so he slipped an arm about her waist. He did this immediately to steady her, he told himself. He reasoned further that such a familiarity could scarcely be offensive in the dark. As she yielded gratefully to his embrace, her soft body palpitating against his own, he ceased reasoning and drew her closer. It was very agreeable to discover that she made no resistance. He could not recollect any sensation quite like this. As yet, he had done nothing improper in a view of the fact that it was every gentleman's bound and duty to suck her beauty in distress. He wondered if his friends at the Grinovold had missed him, then realized with relief that misabandaman never allowed his presence or his absence to interfere in the slightest with her arrangements. They were probably finishing their drinks by now. This would make an entertaining story later in the evening. They would never guess what he was doing. Who is that speaking? He inquired, François, the spider whispered the girl, oh God, how they all have come to hate you. Rally reason from these words that his enemies numbered more than one or two, and involuntarily he asked, ate me, what for? The girl trembled as if you did not know. And what would happen if they found me, ah, us, he persisted, feeling vaguely for some hint. Ah, her breath caught hush. She laid her fingers over the lips of his mask. Van Damne yielded to an ungovernable impulse and a kiss to them through the stiff, harsh cloth. Where at she said in Wonderman, heaven, guard us, you are actually laughing that you are wild I knew, but you are, you have to very strangely misjure. Perhaps I'm intoxicated, he murmured, and pressed her slender waist, meaningly, whereupon as she seemed to feel his arm for the first time. She drew away, but as she disengaged his embrace, her hand encountered his. It is wet, bloody, where you struck the black wolf. That was a good wall, it wasn't that Van Damne chuckled with satisfaction, while she felt for her hand-curt shift, and dabble that his bruised knuckles, I wondered if I could put him out. Then they ceased whispering, for someone was entering the stable beneath them. After a time, the stairs creaked to a heavy tread, a hand tried the door, and they could feel a presence within arms length. They stood motionless, not daring, even to shift their weight upon the crazy floor, until the fellow began to explore the other portion of the loft. That is the spider himself. Breathe the girl, close to Van Damne's ear, he thinks he has me in his web, but, yes, I would die before I marry him. A sudden dislike for spiders in general, a woke in Raleigh's breast. I ate him, I would kill him if I dead, but he frightens me, she broke off and caught at her companion, gasping, oh God, what are you doing? He had turned the key softly and was opening the door. To be quite truthful, Raleigh Van Damne did not know exactly what he intended to do, but some reckless impulse moved him to action. He was invaded by a sudden desire to lay hands upon this spider person, who went about terrorizing pretty girls. Having been rear to a habit of doing exactly as impulse dictated, he felt no hesitation now. Away back in his mind, however, something told him calmly that he had gone quite mad that the magic of adventure had sent his words of flying and had played havoc with his common sense. And a change really had come over him, with the very beginning of this enterprise, although he had not stopped to notice it. The flaring rage that had answered to the wolves assault upon the girl, the joyful sensation of setting his fist into the fellow's face, the excitement of the flight and the pursuit had all combined to upset his equilibrium. Then too, the presence of this be witching creature close beside him in the darkness, the pressure of her body and his arms, the scent of her warm breath. All this helped to completely electrify him. He felt the dawning of new and utterly absurd desires, away with discretion to the winds with prudence. This maidens cause was his, here was the one glad moment of his life. Frans Warr, he called in a low voice, he slipped the girl's hand from his arm, thrust her back into the shadow and stepped out upon the landing. We, in a moment, the spider came stumbling toward him, she is not here that dams are at home and an abdominal like his own. Saka, she has disappeared and that devil spawn is with her, you found no trace in the yard below. Listen, Obrith Rally, he sank his fingers into his palms and measured the distance carefully, then as Frans Warr turned his head attentively, Rally raised himself and swung. It may have been due to the uncertain light or to the narrow eyelid holes through which he peered at any rate, then dams below went short. The spider uttered a cry of fury and surprise. Rally felt himself hugged by a pair of thin, iron-mustled arms, then his hands felt in beneath the man's disguise and the cry changed to a girl. They strained and wrought against each other briefly, the floor sagged and creaked, the door behind them flew open. Frans Warr was groping with one free hand that is waste, but his domino was like a shirt and he could not find that for which his hungry finger searched. As for that dam, a delicious ferocity was flaming through his veins. Here was an enemy bent upon his quick destruction. No game he had ever played was half so exhilarating as this. He could fuel the fellow Rys and the breath bursting through beneath his fingers. He could feel the man's cords hardened until they were like wire. Strange to say, with every wrench and every surge his own abysmal fury increased, but the spider was no weakling. He fought desperately until in a burst of blind anger that was like some diabolic bleep, then dam lifted him bodily and hurled him at the opening in the floor. The fellow, Mr. Footing, clawed wildly, then fell backward, head long into the light below. The next instant of andam, too, had lost his balance and followed, bumping from step to step, until he fetched up at the foot with a jar that drove the breath out of him. He sat up in a moment still dazed, then he heard a Russell and beheld above him a pair of frightened, dark eyes gazing into his. Although he could see nothing of the girl's face, she had replaced her mask. He knew that she was racked with anxiety. Are you killed? She queried. No, just abominably twisted, he said. Then with a rye face, outshed that was an awful bump. As he felt himself over gingerly, he stopped short at the side of his mask, lying crumpled beside him. He realized that the jig was up and began to formulate an explanation of his deception, only to hear her exclaimed tremulously, God be praised you are unheard. He sat still staring at her, amazed that no outburst followed her glimpse of his face. How did you dare? She turned to the figure of Fanswaw, which roly discovered motionless and arms length away. The spider was sprawled loosely in the litter. His head was twisted upon his shoulders in a peculiar way, and his mask having slipped to the back, stared upward with a plastic wax-like smile that was horrible under the circumstances. Still lost in wonderment, Van Dam arose, dusted off his clothing, and picked up his own disguise. Was it possible that she did not know the person she had gone to meet? It seemed so indeed, for she was hanging upon him anxiously, as if still doubting his safety, while she half-solved her admiration of his bravery and her gratitude at his escape. Raleigh began to fear he had been imposed upon after all, else how could she fail to realize that he was an utter stranger? But the girl's honesty was compelling. He found that he could not doubt this inserity of her gaze. He felt an unaccountable lack of compunction regarding the spider. In fact, he experienced a sense of satisfaction at the completeness of his victory over the roughen, and she seemed to share the feeling. He heard her urging him to make haste, and before he had fully regained his wits, he found himself following her out into the sunlight. Underneath the wagon shed, she guided him, around behind it, and into a narrow three-foot space, the left side of which was bounded by a board fence about head-eye. Quick, she cried eagerly, once we are on the other side, we may escape. The others are somewhere close by. And the story one part one.","Action & Adventure Fiction, Published 1900 onward",English,08:34:43,David Wales,"['Spanish', 'Elana', 'French', 'Frans']","['Bad Dam', 'Gwiridrolly', ""Elner Banamman's"", 'Van Dam', 'Ragged Negroes', ""Van Damne's"", 'Norman', 'Raleigh', 'Saka', 'Eleanor', 'Van Damme', 'Frans Warr', 'David Wales', 'Vanamun', 'de pońciana', 'Gras', 'Rys', 'the Mardi Gras', 'Rolly', 'Grinovold', 'Raleigh Van Damne', 'Wonderman', 'Footing', 'Rex', 'Mardi Gras', 'Damme', 'Russell', 'Banamman', 'Van Damne', 'Roland']","['Banam', 'Fanswaw', 'New Orleans', 'Satan', 'François', 'Rex Beach', 'Roland', 'Palm Beach']",[],0,0,0,0,15,2,0
Far Above Rubies,George MacDonald,93241,4.0,"April 9, 2018",[],0,"org. Farab of Rubies by George McDonald. Part 1 Hector McIntosh was a young man about 5 and 20, who were the proclivities of the count and inherited also some of the consequent disabilities, as well as some that were accidental. Among the rest was a strong tendency to regard only the ideal, and turn away from any authority derived from an inferior source. His chief delight lay in the attempt to embody in what seemed to him the natural form of verse, the thoughts in him constantly moving at least in the direction of the ideal, even when he was most conscious of his inability to attain to the utterance of them. But it was only in the retirement of his own chamber that he attempted their embodiment of all things he shrank from any communion, whatever concerning these cherished matters. Nor indeed had he any friends who could tempt him to share with them what seemed to him his best, so that in truth he was intimate with none. His mind would dwell much upon love and friendship in the imaginary abstract, but of neither had he had the smallest immediate experience. He had cherished only the ideals of the purest and highest sort of either passion, and seemed to find satisfaction enough in the endeavor to embody such in his verse, without even imagining himself in communication with any visionary public. The era had not yet dawned when every scribblers consumed with the vain ambition of being recognized, not indeed as what he is, but as what he pictures himself in his secret sessions of thought. That disease could hardly attack him while yet his very imaginations recoiled from the thought of the inimical presence of a stranger consciousness. Whether this was a modesty or had its hidden base in conceit, I am with the few insights I have had into his mind, unable to determine. That he had leisure for the indulgence of his bent was the result of his peculiar position. He lived in the house of his father and was in his father's employment, so that he was able both to accommodate himself to his father's requirements, and at the same time fully indulges his own a special taste. The elder Macintosh was a banker in one of the larger County Towns of Scotland, at least such as the profession and position they are accorded by popular consent to one who is, in fact, only a bank agent, for it is a post involving a good deal of influence and a yet greater responsibility. Of this responsibility, however, he had allowed his son to feel nothing, merely using him as a clerk, and leaving him as soon as the stated hour for his office work expired, free in mind as well as body until the new day should make a fresh claim upon his time and attention. His mother seldom saw him except at meals, and indeed, although he always behaved due to flee to her, there was literally no intercommunity of thought or feeling between them, a fact which probably had a good deal to do with the undveloped condition in which Hector found, or rather, did not find himself. Occasionally his mother wanted him to accompany her for a call, but he avoided yielding as much as possible and generally with success. For this was one of the claims of social convention against which he steadily rebelled, the more determinedly that, in none of his mother's friends, could he take the smallest interest? For she was essentially a common place because I'm vicious woman, without a spark of aspiration and her friends were of the same sort, without regard for anything but what was, or at least they supposed to be, the fashion. Indeed, it was hard to understand how Hector came ever to be born of such a woman, although in truth she was of his pure Celtic origin as her husband, only blood is not spirit, and that is often clearly manifest. His father, on the other hand, was not without some signs of an imagination, quite undeveloped indeed, and I believe suppressed by the requirements of his business relations. At the same time, Hector knew that he cherished not a little in-dignation against the influence of the good Dr. Johnson in regard to both Ossian and his humble translator McPherson, upholding the genuineness of both, although unable to enter into and set forth the points of the argument on either side. As to Hector, he reveled in the ancient traditions of his family, and not unfrequently in his earlier youth, had made an attempt to reembodied some of its legends into English, vain as regarded the retention of the special eriness and suggestiveness of their vaguely showing symbolism. For often he dropped his pen with a sigh of despair at the elusiveness of the special aroma of the Celtic imagination. For the rest, he had had as good an education as Scotland could in those days afford him, one of whose best features was the negative one that it did not at all interfere with the natural course of his in-born tendencies, and merely developed the power of expressing himself in what manner he might think fit. Let me add that he had a good conscience. I mean, a conscience ready to give him warning of the least tendency to overstep any line of prohibition, and that, as yet, he had never consciously refused to attend to such warning. Another thing I must mention is that, although his mind was constantly haunted by imaginary forms of loveliness, he had never yet been what is called in love. For he had never yet seen anyone who even approached his idea of spiritual at once and physical attraction. He was content to live and wait, without even the notion that he was waiting for anything. He went on writing his verses and receiving the reward, such as it was, of having placed on record the thoughts which had come to him, so that he might at will recall them. Neither had he any thought of the mental soil which was thus slowly gathering for the possible growth of an unknown seed, fit for growing and developing in that same unknown soil. One day there arrived in that cold northern city, a certain cold sunshiney morning, gay and sparkling, and with it the beginning of what, for one to have a better word, we may call his fate. He knew nothing of its approach, had not even the slightest provision that the divinity had that moment put his hand to the shaping of his rough-hune ends. It was early October by the calendar, but leaves brown and spotted and dry lay already in little heaps on the pavement. Heaps made and unmade continually, as if for the sport of the keen wind that now scattered them with a rush, and again, extemporising a little evidence and whirlpool, gathered up a fresh heap upon the flags, again to rush a thunder. As in diarist terror of the fresh invading wind, determined yet again to scatter them, a broken route of escaping fugitives. Along the pavement, seemingly in furtherance of the careless design of the wind, a grow wind heedlessly scushling along, among the unresting and unresisting leaves, making with her rather short skirt a mimic whirlwind of her own. Her eyes were fixed on the ground and she seemed absorbed in anxious thought, which thought had its origin in one of the communist causes of human proplexity, the need of money, and the impossibility of devising a scheme by which to procure any. It was, but a few weeks since her father had died, leaving behind him such a scanty provision for his widow and child, that only by the utmost care and coaxing were they able from the first to make it meet their necessities. Nor indeed, would it have been possible for them to subsist, had not a brother of the widow supplemented their poor resources, with an uncertain contingent whose continuance he was not able to secure, or even dared to promise. At the present moment, however, it was not anxiety as to their own affairs that occupied the mind of Annie Melville, near enough as that might have lane. It was the unhappy condition in which the imprudence of a school friend, almost her only friend, had involved herself by her hasty marriage with a man who, up to the present moment, had shown no faculty for helping himself or the wife he had involved in his fate, and who did not know where or by what means to procure even the bread of which they were in immediate want. Now Annie had never had to suffer hunger, and the idea that her companion from childhood should be exposed to such a fate was what she could not bear. Yet, for any way out of it she could see, it would have to be born. She might possibly, by herself, going without, have given her a good piece of bread, but then she would certainly share it with her foolish husband, and there would be little satisfaction in that. They had already arrived at a stage in their downward progress when not gold or even silver, but bear copper was lacking, as the equivalent for the bread that could but keep them alive until the next rousing of the hunger that even now lay across their threshold. And how could she, in her all-but-absolute poverty, do anything? Her mother was but one pays or so from the same goal, and would, as a mother must, interfered to prevent her use this postponement of the inevitable. It was clear she could do nothing, and yet she could ill-consent that it should be so. When her father almost suddenly left them alone, Annie was already acting as assistant in the girls high school, but alas, without any recognition of her services, by even a promise of coming payment, she lived only in the hope of a small salary, dependent on her definite appointment to the office. To attempt to draw upon this hope would be to impair all the appointment itself, she could not even for her friend, risk her mother's prospects already pouring off, and she could not help perceiving the hopelessness of her friend's case, because of the utter characterlessness of the husband to whom she was enslaved. Why interfere with the hunger he would do nothing to force all? How could she even give such a man the six pence which had been her father's last gift to her? But Annie was one to whom, in the course of her life, something strange had not unfrequently happened, chiefly in the shape of what the common mind would set aside as mere coincidence. I do not say many such things had occurred in her life, but together, their strangeness and their recurrence had caused her to remember every one of them, so that, when she reviewed them, they seemed to her many. And now, with a shadowy provision, as it seemed, that something was going to happen, and with a shadowy recollection that she had known beforehand it was coming, something strange did take place. Of such things she used in after days, always to employ the old, stately Bible phrase, it came to pass, she never said, it happened. In the aerial vortex about her feet, scarce the caring what it was, she yet all but mechanically looked at it a little closer, lost it from sight, caught it again, as a fresh blast sent it once more jirating about her feet, and now regarded it more steadfastly. Even then it looked like nothing but another withered leaf, brown and wrinkled, given over to the wind, and rustling along at its mercy. Yet, it made an impression upon her so far unlike that of a leaf, that for a moment more she fixed on it a still keener look of unconscious the expectant eyes, and saw only that it looked perhaps a little larger than most of the other leaves, but as brown and dead as they. Almost the same instant however she turned and pounced upon it, and the moment she handled it became aware that it felt less crumbly and brittle than the other's looked, and then saw clearly that it was not a leaf, but perhaps a rag, or possibly a piece of soiled and rumbled paper. With a curiosity growing to expectation, and in a moment to wonder in recognition she proceeded to un-couple it carefully and smooth it out tenderly. Nor was the process quite completed when she fell upon her knees on the cold flags, her little cloak flowing wide from the clasp at her neck in a yet wilder puff of the bitter wind, but suddenly remembering that she must not be praying in the sight of men, started again to her feet, and wrapping her closed hand tight in the scandy border of her cloak, hurried with a pound note she had rescued, to the friend whose need was sore than her own, not without an undefined anxiety in her heart, whether she was doing right. How much good the note did, or whether it merely fell into the bottomless gulf of irimediable loss, I cannot tell, and he's friend and her shift this mate, at once changed their dirty piece of paper for silver, but food and railway tickets, left the town, and disappeared entirely from her horizon. But consequences were not over with Annie, and the next day she became acquainted with the fact that proved of great significance to her, namely that the same evening she found the money, Mr. McIntosh's kitchen chimney had been on fire, and it wanted but the knowledge of how this had taken place to change the girl's consciousness, and that of one specially aided by the ministry of an angel, to that of a young woman, honest, hither too, suddenly changed into a thief. For in the course of a certain friend the gossip's narrative, it came out that that night the banker had been using the kitchen fire for the destruction of an accumulation of banknotes, the common currency of Scotland, which had been judged altogether too dirty, or too much dilapidated to be reissued. The knowledge of this fact was the slam of the closing door, whereby Annie found her soul shut out to wander in a night of dismay. The woman who told the fact saw nothing of consequence in it. Mrs. Melville, to whom she was telling it, saw nothing but perhaps a lesson on the duty of having chimneys regularly swept, because of the danger to neighbouring that. But had not Annie even seated in the shadow, her gas the countenance would, even to the most casual glance, have betrayed a certain guilty horror, for now she knew that she had found and given away what she ought at once to have handed back to its rightful owner. It was true, he did not even know that he had lost it, and could have no suspicion that she had found it. But what difference did or could that make? It's true also that she had neither taken nor bestowed it to her own advantage, but again, what difference could that make in her duty to restore it? Did she not well remember how eloquently in precisely Mr. Kennedy had, the very last Sunday, expounded the passage, though shall not respect the person of the poor? Right was right, whatever softhearted people might say or think. Anyone might give what was his own, but who could be right in giving away what was another? It was time she had done it without thinking, but she had known or might have known, well enough, that to whom so ever it might belong, it was not hers. And now what possibility was there as setting right what she had set wrong? It was just possible a day might come when she should be able to restore what she had unjustly taken, but at the present moment it was as impossible for her to lay her hand upon a pound note. As upon a million, and terrible thought she might have to enter the presence of her father, dead men called him, but alive she knew him, with a consciousness that she had not brought him back the honor he had left with her. It will of course suggest itself to every reader that here and she was driving her sense of obligation to the verge of foolishness, and indeed the thought did not fail to occur even to herself. But the answer of the self-accusing spirit was that had she been thoroughly upright in heart, she would at once have gone to the nearest house and made such inquiry as most instantly have resulted in the discovery of what had happened. This she had omitted, without thought it is true, but not therefore without blame. And now, so far as she could tell she would never be able to make restitution. Had she even told her mother what we fallen her, her mother might have thought of the way in which it had come to pass, and set her feet in the path of her duty, but she had made evil hast and had compassed too much. She found herself in truth in a sore predicament, and was on the point of starting to her feet to run and confess to Mr. Macintosh which she had done, that he might at once pronounce the penalty on what she never doubted he must regard as a case of simple theft. But she be thought herself that she would remain incapable of offering the least satisfaction, and must therefore be regarded merely as one, who sought by confession to secure forgiveness and remission. What proof had she to offer, even that she had given the money away? To mention the name of her friend would be to bring her into discredit, and transfer to her the blame of her own act. There was nothing she could do, and yet, however was she to go about with such a load upon her conscience. Confessing she might at least be regarded as one who desired and meant to be honest, confession would anyhow ease the weight of her load. Passively at last, from very weariness of thought, her mind was but going backward and forward over its own traces, heedlessly obliterating them. When suddenly a new and horrid consciousness emerged from the trot and slime, that she was glad that at least Sophie had the money. For one passing moment she was glad with the joy of Lady Macbeth that what was done was done and could not be altered, then once more the storm within her awoke and would not again be stilled. But now a third something happened, which brought with it hope, for it suggested a way of deliverance. Impiled by the same power that causes a murderer to haunt the seam of his violence, she left the house, and was unaware whether she was directing her steps until she found herself again passing the door of the bankers house. There, in that same kitchen window, on a level with the pavement she aspired in large, pen-drawn print, the production apparently of the cook or another of the servants, the announcement that a parlor maid was wanted immediately. Again, without waiting to think and only afterwards waking up to the fact and meaning of what she had done, she turned, went back to the entry door and knocked. It was almost suddenly opened by the cook, and it once the storm of her misery was assaged into a rising moon of hope, and the night became light about her. Ah, through what miseries are not even frail hopes are best and safest, are only true guides indeed, into other and yet fairer hopes. Did you want to see the mistress asked the jolly-faced cook where she stood on the other side of the threshold, and without waiting in answer she turned and led the way to the parlor? Annie followed as if across the foundation of the fallen wall of Jericho, and found to her surprise that Mrs. McIntosh knowing her bysight received her with condescension, and Annie feeling grateful for the good humor which she took for kindness, told her simply that she had come to see whether she would accept her services as parlor maid. Mrs. McIntosh seemed surprised at the proposal and asked her the natural question whether she had ever occupied a similar situation. Annie answered she had not, but that at home while her father was alive, she had done so much of the same sort that she believed she could speedily learn all that was necessary. I thought someone told me, said the lady, who was one of the greatest gossips in the town, that you were one of the teachers in the high school. That is true, answered Annie. I was doing so upon probation, but I had not yet begun to receive any salary for it. I was only a sort of apprentice to the work and under no engagement. Mrs. McIntosh, after regarding Annie for some time, and taking silent observation of her modesty and good breeding, said at last, I like the look of you, Mrs. McIntosh. My name is Annie Melvo. Well, Annie, I confess I do not indeed see anything particularly unsuitable in you, but at the same time I cannot help fearing you maybe, or I should say rather, imagine yourself superior to what may be required of you. Oh, no, ma'am, answered Annie. I assure you I am too poor to think of any such thing. Indeed, I am so anxious to make money at once that, if you would consent to give me a trial, I should be ready to come to you this very evening. You will have no wages before the end of your six months. I understand, ma'am. It is a risk to take you without a character. I am very sorry, ma'am, but I have no one that can vouch for me. Except indeed, Mrs. Slater, one of the high school, would say a word in my favor. Well, well, answered Mrs. McIntosh. I am so far pleased with you that I do not think I can be making a great mistake. If I merely give you a trial, you may come tonight, if you like. That is, with your mother's permission. Annie ran home greatly relieved and told her mother what a piece of good fortune she had had. Mrs. Melville did not at all take to the idea at first, for she cherished undefined expectations for Annie, and knew that her father had done so also. For the girl was always reading and had been for years in the habit of reading aloud to him, making now and then a remark that showed she understood well what she read. So the mother took comfort in her disappointment that her child had solely for her sake, she supposed, be taken herself to such service as what it wants secure her livelihood and bring her in a little money, for, with the shadow of coming want growing black above them, even her first half years wages was a point of hope and expectation. Well, Annie, she answered after a few moments consideration. It is but for a time, and you will be able to give up the place as soon as you please, and the easier that she only takes you on trial. That will hold for you as well as for her. But nothing was farther from Annie's intention than finding the place would not suit her. No change could she dream of before at least she had a pound note in her hand, when at once she would make it clear to her mother what a terrible scare had driven her to the sudden step she had taken. Until then she must go about with her whole head sick and her whole heart faint. Neither could she for many weeks rid herself of the haunting notion that the banker, who was chiefly affected by her crime, for as such she fully believed and regarded her deed, was fully aware of her guilt. It seemed to her when at any moment he happened to look at her, that now at last he must be on the point of letting her know that he had read the truth in her guilty looks, and she constantly fancied him saying to himself, this is the girl who stole my money. She feels my eyes upon her. Every time she came home from an errand she would imagine her master looking from the window of his private room on the first floor, in readiness to cast aside forbearance and denounce her. He was only waiting to make himself one shade sure. How long was the time she had to await her cleansing the moment when she could go to him and say, I have wronged. I have wronged you. Here is all I can do to show my repentance. All this time I have been but waiting for my wages to repay what I had taken from you. And oddly enough she was always mixing herself up with the man in the parable, who had received from his master, a pound to trade with and make more. From her dreams she would wake in terror at the sound of that master's voice, ordering the pound to be taken from her and given to the school fellow whom, at the cost of her own honesty, she had befriended. Oh, joyous day when the doom should be lifted from her and she set free to dream no more. For surely when it length her master knew all, with the depth of her sorrow and repentance, he could not refuse his forgiveness. Would he not even, she dared to hope, remit the interest due on his money of which she entertained in her ignorance, a eusiness and preposterous idea.

Marcel is absorbed in his painting, the day is cold, they have no money to buy coal. Marcel takes a chair to burn it, when Rudolph remembers that he has a manuscript, which has been rejected by the publishers and lights a fire with that instead. Colline enters looking abject and miserable. He had gone out to pawn his books, but nobody wanted them. Their friend, Shonard, however, had better luck. He comes bringing fuel and provisions, they all prepare their meal when the landlord enters and demands the payment of his rent. The friends offer him a glass of wine and turn him out amidst joking and laughter. After their gay repost, they separate and Rudolph remains alone writing. A knock is heard at the door and Mimi, a little seamstress who lives on the same floor, appears and asks Rudolph to give her a match to light her candle. As she is about to go out, she falls in a faint. Rudolph gives her wine and restores her to consciousness. She tells him that she suffers from consumption. Rudolph is struck by her beauty and her delicate hands. She notices that she has lost her key and whilst they search for it, their candles are extinguished. As they grow up on the floor in the dark, Rudolph finds the key and puts it in his pocket. Their hands meet and Rudolph tries to warm her hands and tells her all about his life. Mimi confides her struggles to him and their conversation soon turns upon their love for each other. Act 2. Rudolph's friends have repaired to their favorite cafe. It is Christmas Eve and everyone is in festive spirits. All the shops are bright and displaying their goods. Hawkers offer their goods for sale in the streets. Rudolph and Mimi are seen entering a milleners where Rudolph is to buy her a new hat. Colleen, Shonard and Marcel take their seats in front of the cafe where a table has been prepared for them. Rudolph introduces Mimi to his friends. Muzetta, Marcel's flame with whom he has quarreled, now enters with Elcindoro. Marcel is deeply moved when he sees her. Muzetta notices this and sends Elcindoro on an errand. Whilst he is away, she makes peace with Marcel. The friends find that they have not sufficient money to pay for their supper, so they carry Elcindoro and leave their bills to be paid by Elcindoro. Act 3. Months have elapsed, bringing joy and misery to Rudolph and Mimi. Rudolph loves Mimi passionately but is consumed with jealousy. On a winchery day, Marcel is seen leaving a tavern near the gates of Paris. He meets Mimi. She looks pale and haggard. She asks Marcel to help her and tells him of Rudolph's love and jealousy, explaining that she must leave him. Rudolph now comes upon the scene and not seeing Mimi tells of all the miseries of their lives, how he loves her and believes her to be dying of consumption. Mimi's cough betrays her and although she says goodbye to Rudolph, they find they cannot part and determine to await the spring. Meanwhile, Muzetta and Marcel have a violent quarrel. Act 4. Marcel and Rudolph are now living together in their attic studio. Muzetta and Mimi have left them. They are seemingly working but their thoughts wander towards the woman they love. Shonad and Colleen enter with roles and a herring for their meal. They have a wild time and are dancing and singing when Muzetta enters and tells them that Mimi is outside, so we can't ill that she can go no further. They make up a bed on the couch for her and bring her in. She clings to Rudolph and implores him not to leave her. Mimi reconciles Marcel and Muzetta. Muzetta tells her old friends that Mimi is dying and gives them her earrings to sell, asking them to get a doctor for Mimi. They all go out leaving Rudolph alone with Mimi. He holds her in his arms and recalls their love. Mimi is seized with a fit of coughing and falls back in a faint. Muzetta returns with medicine. Mimi regains consciousness and turning to Rudolph tells him of her love. Muzetta falls upon her knees in prayer and Mimi passes away in Rudolph's arms. Rain or dust cold or heat nothing stops these bold adventures. Their existence of everyday is a work of genius, a daily problem which they always can try to solve with the aid of bold mathematics. When warned presses them, abstemuses anchorates. But if a little fortune falls into their hands, see them ride forth on the most ruinous fancies, loving the ferris and youngest, drinking the oldest and best wines. And not finding enough windows whence to throw their money. Then, the last crown dead and buried. They begin again to die at the tabla dot of chance, where their cover is always laid.

Human Nature And Conduct - Part 1,John Dewey,38589,7.0,"July 9, 2018",[],0," domain. For more information or to volunteer, please visit libravox.org. This recording is by William Jones. The book begins with this interdession by John Duoy. Proverb, give a dog a bad name and hang-em. Human nature has been the dog of professional moralist and consequences accord with this proverb. Men's nature has been regarded with suspicion, with fear, with sour looks, and sometimes with enthusiasm for its possibilities, but only when these were placed in contrast with this actualities. Human nature has appeared to be so evenly disposed that the business of morality was to prune and curb it. It would be thought better of if it could be replaced by something else. It has been supposed that morality would be quite superfluous, or not for the inherent weakness, bordering on depravity of human nature. Some writers with a more genial conception have attributed the current blackening to theologians who have thought to honor the divine by disparaging the human. Theologians have doubtless taken a gloomy review of men, then have pagans and secularists. But this explanation doesn't take us far. For, after all, these theologians are themselves human. And they would have been without influence if the human audience had not somehow responded to them. Morality is largely concerned with controlling human nature. When we are attempting to control anything, we are acutely aware of what resistors. So moralists were led perhaps to think of human nature as evil because of its reluctance to yield to control, its rebelliousness under the yoke. But this explanation only raises another question. Why did morality set up rule so foreign to human nature? The incident insisted upon the regulations it imposed, or after all outgrifts of human nature. Why then was human nature so adverse to them? Moreover, rules can be obeyed and ideals are realized only as they appeal to something in human nature and awaken in it an act of response. So moral principles that exalt themselves by degrading human nature are in effect committing suicide, or else they involve human nature in unending civil war and treated as a hopeless mess of contradictory forces. We are forced therefore to consider the nature and origin of that controlled of human nature with which morals has been occupied. And the fact which is first upon us when you raise this question is the existence of classes. Control has been vested in it oligarchy. In difference to regulation has grown in the gap which separates the rule from the rulers, parents, priests, chiefs, social sensors have supplied aims, aims which were foreign to those upon whom they were imposed to the young, layman, and ordinary folk. They few have given and administered rule. And the masses have an a passable fashion and with reluctance obeyed. Everybody knows that good children are those who make us little trouble as possible for their elders. And since most of them cause a good deal of annoyance they must be naughty by nature. Generally speaking, good people have been those who did what they were told to do and lack of eager compliance is a sign of something wrong in their nature. But no matter how much men in authority have turned moral rules and do an agency of class supremacy, any theory which attributes the origin of rule to deliberate design is false, to take advantage of conditions after they have come into existence is one thing. To create them for the sake of an advantage to a crew is quite another thing. We must go back to the bare fact of social division into superior and inferior. To say that accident produced social conditions is to perceive they were not produced by intelligence. Like of understanding of human nature is the primary cause of disregard for it. Like of insight, always ends in despising or else unreasonable. When men had no scientific knowledge of physical nature, they either passively submitted to it or sought to control it magically. What cannot be understood cannot be managed intelligently. It has to be forced into subjection from without. The old thickness of human nature to reason is equivalent to a belief in its intrinsic irregularity. Once a decline in the authority of social oligarchy was accompanied by a rise of scientific interest in human nature. This means that the makeup and working of human forces are for the basis for moral ideas and ideals. Our science of human nature in comparison with physical sciences is rudimentary and morals which are concerned with the health, efficiency and happiness of a development of human nature are correspondingly elementary. These pages are discussion of some phases of the ethical change involved in positive respect for human nature when the latter is associated with scientific knowledge. We may anticipate the general nature of this change through considering the evils which have resulted from several immorals from the actualities of human physiology and psychology. There is a pathology of goodness as well as a vehicle. That is of that sort of goodness which is nurtured by this separation. The badness of good people for the most part recorded only in fiction is the revenge taken by human nature for the injuries heaped upon it in the name of morality. In the first place, morals cut off from the positive roots in human nature is bound to be mainly negative. The vehicle emphasis falls on avoidance, escape of evil, upon not doing things, observing prohibitions. Negative morals assume this many forms as there are types of temperament subject to it. In its commonest form is the protective coloration of a neutral respectability and insipidity of character. For one man who face God that he is not his other man, there are a thousand to offer thanks that they are as other men, sufficiently as others are to escape attention. Absence of social blame is the usual mark of goodness for it shows that evil has been avoided. Blame is most readily averted by being so much like everybody else that one passes unnoticed. Conventional morality is a drab morality. In which the only fatal thing is to be conspicuous. If there be flavor left in it, in some natural traits have somehow escaped being subdued. To be so good is to attract notice is to be pregaged. Too good for this world. The same psychology that brands the convicted criminal as forever a social outcast makes it the part of a gentleman not to obtrude virtues noticeably upon others. The Puritan is never popular, not even in a society of Puritans. In case of a pinch the mass prefer to be good fellows, rather than to be good men. Poolite vice is preferable to eccentricity and ceases to be vice. Morals that professedly neglect human nature end by emphasizing those qualities of human nature that are most commonplace and average. They exaggerate the herd instinct to conformity. A professional guardians of morality who have been exacting with respect to themselves have accepted avoidance of conspicuous evil as enough for the masses. One of the most instructive things in all human history is the system of concessions, tolerances, mitigations and reprieves which the Catholic Church with this official supernatural morality has devised for the multitude. The situation of the spirit of everything natural is tempered by organized leniency for the frayalties of flesh. To uphold an enloof realm of strictly ideal realities is admitted to be possible only for a few. Partisanism, except in a most zealous forms, has accomplished the same result by a sharp separation between religion and morality in which a higher justification by faith disposes at one stroke of daily lapses into the gregarious morals of average conduct. There are always rudder, forceful natures which cannot tame themselves to the required level of colorless conformity. To them, conventional morality appears as an organized futility. Though they are usually unconscious of their own attitude, since they are partily in favor of morality for the mass is making it easier to manage them. Their only standard is success, put in things over, getting things done. Being good is to them practically synonymous with ineffectuality. An accomplishment achievement is its own justification. They know by experience that much is forgiven to those who succeed and they leave goodness to the stupid to those whom they qualify as boobs. Their gregarious nature finds sufficient outlet, in the conspicuous tribute they pay to all established institutions as guardians of ideal interests, and in their denunciation of all who openly defy can visualize ideals. Or they discover that they are the chosen agents of a higher morality, and walk subject to specially ordained laws. High-pocracy, in the sense of a deliberate curing up of a will to evil by loud voice protestations of virtue, is one of the rarest occurrences. But the combination in the same person of an intensely executive nature with a love of popular approval is bound in the face of conventional morality, to produce what the critical term hypocrisy. Another reaction to the separation of morals from human nature is a romantic glorification of natural impulse as something superior to all moral claims. There are those who lack the persistent force of the executive will to break through conventions and to use them for their own purposes, but who unite since the tivinists with intensity of desire. Fastening upon the conventional element in morality, they hold the vulnerability is a conventionality hampering through the development of individuality. Although appetites are the commonest things in human nature, the least distinctive or individualized, they identify unrestrained in satisfaction of appetite with free realization of individuality. They treat subjection to passion as a manifestation of freedom in the degree in which it shocks the bourgeois. The urgent need for a transvaluation of morals is caricatured by the notion that an avoidance of the avoidances of conventional morals constitutes positive achievement. While the executive type keeps its eye on actual conditions, so as to manipulate them, this school aggregates objective intelligence in behalf of sentiment and withdrawals into little queries of emancipated souls. There are others who take seriously the idea of morals separated from the ordinary actualities of humanity and who attempt to live up to it. Some become engrossed in spiritual egotism. They are preoccupied with the state of their character, concerned for the purity of their motives and the goodness of their souls. The exaltation of conceit, which sometimes accompanies this absorption, can produce a corrosive in humanity which exceeds the possibilities of any other known form of selfishness. In other cases, persistent preoccupation with the thought of an ideal realm breeds morbid discontent with surroundings or induces a feudal withdrawal into an inner world where all facts are fair to the eye. The needs of actual conditions are neglected or dealt with in a half-hearted way because in the light of the ideal, they are so mean and sorted. To speak of evil, described seriously for change, shows a low mind. Or, again, the ideal becomes a refuge in the silence. A way of escape from tiresome responsibilities. In varied ways, men come to live in two worlds. When the actual, the other the ideal. Some are tortured by the sense of their irreconcilability. Others alternate between the two, compensating for the strains of renunciation involved in membership in the ideal realm by pleasurable excursions into their delights of the actual. If we turn from concrete effects upon character to theoretical issues, we single out the discussion regarding freedom of will as typical of the consequences that come from separating morals from human nature. Men are worried with bootless discussions and anxious to dismiss it as a metaphysical subtlety. But nevertheless, it contains within itself the most practical of all moral questions. The nature of freedom and the means of its achieving. The separation of morals from human nature leads to a separation of human nature in its moral aspect from the rest of nature and from ordinary social habits and endeavors, which are found in business, civic life, the run of companionships and recreations. These things are thought of at most as places where moral notions need to be applied, not as places where moral ideas are to be studied in moral energies generated. In short, the severance of morals from human nature ends by driving morals inwards from the public open out of doors, air and light of day into the obscurities and the processes of the processes of the human nature. These significance of the traditional discussion of free will is that it reflects precisely a separation of moral activity from nature and the public life of men. One has to turn from the moral theories to the general human struggle for political, economic and religious liberty, for freedom of thought. The symbolization creates to find significant reality in the conception of freedom of will. Then one finds himself out of the stifling, the close atmosphere of an inner consciousness and in the open air world. The cost of confining moral freedom to an inner region is the almost complete severance of ethics from politics and economics. The former is regarded as summed up in edifying exhortations and the latter is connected with the arts of expediency separated from larger issues of good. In short, there are two schools of social reform. One, basis itself on the notion of immorality with springs from an inner freedom, something mysteriously cooped up within personality, it asserts that the only way to change institutions is to remain to purify their own hearts and that when this has been accomplished, change of institutions will follow of itself. The other school denies the existence of any such inner power and in so doing conceives that it has denied all moral freedom, that men are made what they are by the forces of the environment. The human nature is purely malleable and that to institutions are change, nothing can be done. Clearly, this leaves the outcome as hopeless as does an appeal to inner rectitude and benevolence. For it provides no leverage for change of environment, it throws us back upon accident, usually disguised as a necessary law of history or evolution. And trust to some violent change, symbolize the civil war to usher in an abrupt millennium. Well, there is an alternative to being pinned in between these two theories. We can recognize that all conduct is interaction between elements of human nature and the environment, natural and social. Then we shall see that progress proceeds in two ways and that freedom is found in that kind of interaction, which maintains an environment in which human desire and choice count for something. There are in truth forces in men, as well as without him. While they are infinitely frail in comparison with exterior forces, yet they may have the support of a foreseen and contriving intelligence. When we look at the problem as one of an adjustment to be intelligently attained, the issue shifts from within personality to an engineering issue, the establishment of arts of education and social guidance. The idea persists that there is something materialistic about natural science and that morals are degraded by having anything seriously to do with material things. If a sect should arise proclaiming that men ought to purify their lungs completely before they ever drew a breath, get onto when many adherents from professed moralists. For the neglect of sciences that deals specifically with facts of natural and social environment leads to a side tracking of moral forces into an unreal privacy of an unreal self. It is impossible to say how much of the remedial suffering of the world is due to the fact that physical science is looked upon as merely physical. It is impossible to say how much of the unnecessary slavery of the world is due to the conception that moral issues can be settled within conscience or human sentiment apart from consistent study of facts and applications of specific knowledge and industry, dull and politics. Outside of manufacturing and transportation, science gets its chance in war. These facts perpetuate war and the hardest, most brutal side of modern industry. Each sign of disregard for the moral potentialities of physical science grabs the conscience of mankind away from concern with the interactions of man in nature, which must be mastered, freedom is to be a reality. It diverts intelligence to anxious preoccupation with the unrealities of a purely inner life or strengthens reliance upon outbursts of sentimental affection. The masses warm through the occult for assistance. The cult of it is mild and timpsuously. They might smile as the saying goes out of the other side of their mouths if they realize how recourse to the occult exhibits the practical logic of their own beliefs. For both, rest upon his separation of moral ideas and feelings from knowledgeable facts of wife, man and the world. It is not pretended that a moral theory based upon realities of human nature and a study of the specific connections of these realities with those of physical science would do away with moral struggle and defeat. It would not make the moral life as simple a matter as winning ones away along a well-lighted boulevard. All action is an invasion of the future of the unknown. Conflict and uncertainty are the ultimate traits, but morals based upon concern with facts and deriving guidance from knowledge of them would at least locate the points of effective endeavor and would focus available resources upon them. He would put an end to the impossible attempt to live in two unrelated worlds. It would destroy fixed distinction between the human and the physical as well as that between the moral and the industrial and political. A morals based upon study of human nature instead of upon this regard for it would find the facts of man continuous with those of the rest of nature and with thereby ally ethics and physics and biology. He would find the nature and activities of one person co-terminus with those of other human beings and therefore link ethics with the study of history, sociology law and economics. Such a morals would not automatically solve moral problems, nor resolve proplexities, but it would enable us to state problems in such forms that action could be co-regulously and intelligently directed to their solution. Even not as sure as against failure, but it would render failure a source of instruction. Even not protect us against the future emergence of equally serious moral difficulties, but it would enable us to approach the always recurring troubles with a fund of growing knowledge which would add significant values to our conduct even when we overtly fail as we should continue to do. Until the integrity of morals with human nature and of both with the environment is recognized, we shall be deprived of the aid of past experience to cope with the most acute and deep problems of life. Accurate and extensive knowledge will continue to operate only in dealing with purely technical problems. The intelligent acknowledgement of the continuity of nature, man and society will alone secure a growth of morals which will be serious without being fanatical, aspiring without sentimentality, adapted to reality without conventionality, sensible without taking the form of calculation of profits and idealistic without being romantic.

Recording by Kane Mercer. My inventions, part 1, my early life. By Nikola Tesla, this article was published in Electrical Experimenter February 1919. How does the world's greatest inventor invent? How does he carry out an invention? What sort of mentality has Nikola Tesla? Was his early life as commonplace as most of ours? What was the early training of one of the world's chosen? These and many other very interesting questions are answered in an incomparable manner by Nikola Tesla himself in this, his first article. In his autobiography, treating mainly on his early youth, we obtain a good insight into the wonderful life this man has led. It reads like a fairy tale, which has the advantage of being true. Or Tesla is no common mortal. He has led a charmed life. Struck down by the past, the cholera, and whatnot, given up by doctors at least three times as dead. We find him at 60, younger than ever. But read his own words, you have never read the like before. Editor. The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers. And in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pedulous elements. Speaking for myself, I have already had more than my full measure of this exquisite enjoyment. So much that for many years my life was a little short of continuous rapture. I am credited with being one of the hardest workers. And perhaps I am. If thought is the equivalent of labor, for I have devoted to it almost all of my waking hours. But if work is interpreted to be a definite performance in a specified time according to a rigid rule, then I may be the worst of idolers. Every effort under a compulsion demands a sacrifice of life energy. I never paid such a price. On the contrary, I have thrived on my thoughts. In attempting to give a connected and faithful account of my activities in this series of articles which will be presented with the assistance of the editors of the electrical experimenter and are chiefly addressed to our young man readers. I must well, however reluctantly, only impressions of my youth and the circumstances and events which have been instrumental in determining my career. Our first endeavors are purely instinctive, promptings of an imagination vivid and undisciplined, as we grow older, reason asserts itself and we become more and more systematic and designing. But those early impulses, though not immediately productive, are of the greatest moment, and may shape our very destinies. Indeed, I feel now that how I understood and cultivated instead of suppressing them, I would have added substantial value to my request to the world. But not until I had attained manhood did I realize that I was an inventor. This was due to a number of causes. In the first place, I had a brother who was gifted to an extraordinary degree, one of those rare phenomena of mentality which biological investigation has failed to explain. His premature death left my parents' disconsolate. We owned a horse, which had been presented to us by a dear friend. It was a magnificent animal of a rabion breed, possessed of almost human intelligence, and was cared for and petted by the whole family, having on one occasion saved my father's life under remarkable circumstances. My father had been called one winter night to perform an urgent duty and while crossing the mountains infested by wolves, the horse became frightened and ran away, throwing him violently to the ground. It arrived home bleeding and exhausted, but after the alarm was sounded immediately dashed off again, returning to the spot, and before the searching party were far on the way, they were met by my father, who had recovered consciousness and remounted, not realizing that he had been lying in the snow for several hours. This horse was responsible for my brother's injuries from what she died. I witnessed the tragic scene, and although 56 years have a lap since, my visual impression of it has lost none of its force. The recollection of his attainments made every effort of mine seemed dull in comparison. Anything I did that was creditable merely caused my parents to feel their loss more keenly. So I grew up with little confidence myself. But I was far from being considered a stupid boy, if I am to judge from an incident of which I have still a strong remembrance. One day the alderman were passing through a street where I was at play with other boys. The oldest of these venerable gentlemen, a wealthy citizen, paused to give a silver piece to each of us. Coming to me, he suddenly stopped and commanded, looking my eyes. I met his gaze, my hand outstretched to receive the much valued coin, went to my dismay, he said, no, not much. You can get nothing from me, you are too smart. They used to tell a funny story about me. I had two old aunts with wrinkled faces, one of them having two teeth protruding like tusks of an elephant, which he buried in my cheek every time she kissed me. Nothing would scare me more than the prospect of being hugged by these affectionate as unattractive relatives. It happened that while being carried in my mother's arms, they asked me, who was the prettier of the two? After examining their faces intently, I answered thoughtfully pointing to one of them. This here is not as ugly as the other. Then again, I was intended for my very birth for the clerical profession, and this thought constantly oppressed me. I long to be an engineer, but my father was inflexible. He was the son of an officer who served in the army of the Great Napoleon, and, in common with his brother, Professor of Mathematics in a prominent institution, had received a military education, but singularly enough, later embraced the clergy, in which vocation he achieved eminence. He was a very erudite man, a veritable natural philosopher, poet and writer, and his sermons were said to be as eloquent as those of Abrahamasantaklara. He had a prodigious memory, and frequently recited at length from works in several languages. He often remarked playfully that if some of the classics were lost, he could restore them. His style of writing was much admired. He penned sentences short and turs and was full of wit and satire. The humorous remarks he made were always peculiar and characteristic. Just to illustrate, I may mention one or two instances. On the help, there was a cross-eyed man called Maine, employed to do work around the farm. He was chopping wood one day. As he swung the axe, my father, who stood nearby and felt very uncomfortable, cautioned him. For God's sake, Maine, do not strike at what you are looking, but at what you intend to hit. On another occasion, he was taking out for a drive, a friend who carelessly permitted his costly for coat to rub on the carriage wheel. My father reminded him of it, saying, pull in your coat, you were ruining my tire. He had the odd habit of talking to himself and would often carry on an animated conversation and indulge in heated argument, changing the tone of his voice. A casual listener might have sworn that several people were in the same room. Although I must trace to my mother's influence, whatever inventiveness I possess, the training he gave me must have been helpful. The comprised all sorts of exercises, as, guessing one another starts, discovering the defects of some former expression, repeating long sentences or performing mental calculations. These daily lessons were intended to strengthen memory and reason and especially to develop the critical sense and were undoubtedly very beneficial. My mother descended from one of the oldest families in the country and the line of inventors. Both her father and grandfather originated numerous implements for household, agricultural and other uses. She was a truly great woman of rare skill, courage and fortitude, who had brave the storms of life and passed through many a trying experience. When she was 16 a virulent pestilence swept the country, her father was called away to administer the last sacraments to the dying and during his absence, she went alone to the assistance of a neighbouring family who were stricken by the dread disease. All of the members, five and number, succumbed in rapid succession. She bathed, clothed and laid out the bodies decorating them with flowers according to the custom of the country and when her father returned he found everything ready for a Christian burial. My mother was an inventor of the first order and would, I believe, have achieved great things had she not been so remote from modern life and its multifold opportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices and wore of the finest designs from thread which was spun by her. She even planted the seeds, raised the plants, and separated the fibers herself. She worked indifatigably from break of day to late at night and most of the wearing a peril and furnishings of the home was the product of her hands. When she was past 60, her fingers were still nimble enough to tie three knots in an eyelash. There was another and still more important reason for my late awakening. In my boyhood, I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance of images, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marked the sight of real objects and interfered with my thought and action. There were pictures of things and scenes which I had already seen, never of those I imagined. When a word was spoken to me, the image of the object it designated would present itself vividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whether what I saw was tangible or not. This caused me great discomfort and anxiety. None of the students of psychology or physiology whom I have consulted could ever explain satisfactorily these phenomena. They seem to have been unique although I was probably predisposed as I know my brother experienced a similar trouble. The theory I have formulated is that the images were the result of a reflex action from the brain on the retina under great excitation. They certainly were not hallucinations such as are produced in diseased and anguished minds for in other respects I was normal and composed. To give an idea of my distress, suppose that I had witnessed a funeral or some such nerve-wracking spectacle. Then inevitably in the stillness of night a vivid picture of the scene with rust itself before my eyes and persist despite all my efforts to vanish it. Sometimes it would even remain fixed and space though I pushed my hand through it. If my explanation is correct, it should be able to project on a screen the image of any object one conceives and make it visible such an advance would revolutionize all human relations. I am convinced that this wonder can and will be accomplished in time to come. I may add that I have devoted much thought to the solution of the problem. To free myself of these tormenting appearances I tried to concentrate my mind on something else I had seen and in this way I would often obtain temporary relief but in order to get it I had to conjure continuously new images. It was not long before I found that I had exhausted all of those at my command. My real had run out as it were because I had seen little of the world only objects in my home and the immediate surroundings. As I performed these mental operations for the second or third time in order to chase the appearances from my vision the remedy gradually lost all its force. Then I instinctively commenced to make excursions beyond the limits of the small world of which I had knowledge and I saw new scenes. These were at first very blurred and indistinct and would flip away when I tried to concentrate my attention upon them but by and by I succeeded in fixing them. They gained in strength and distinctness and finally assumed the correctness of real things. I soon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in my vision farther and farther getting new impressions all the time and so I began to travel of course in my mind. Every night and sometimes during the day when alone I would start on my journeys. Every new places, cities and countries live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and however unbelievable it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actual life and not a bit less intense in their manifestations. This I did constantly until I was about 17 when my thoughts turned seriously to invention. Then I observed my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. Thus I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method of materializing inventive concepts and ideas which is radically opposite to the purely experimental and is in my opinion ever so much more expedious and efficient. The moment one constructs a device to carry into practice a crude idea, he finds himself unavoidably engrossed with the details and defects of the apparatus. As he goes on improving and reconstructing, his force of concentration diminishes and he loses sight of the great underlying principle. Results may be obtained but always at the sacrifice of quality. My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea, I start at once, building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no difference whatsoever, the results are the same. In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention, every possible improvement I can think of and see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form this final product of my brain. In veryably my device works as I conceive that it should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I planned it. In 20 years there has not been a single exception. Why should it be otherwise? Engineering, electrical and mechanical is positive in results. There is scarcely a subject that cannot be mathematically treated and the effects calculated or the results determined beforehand from the available theoretical and practical data. The carrying out in the practice of a crude idea as is being generally done is, I hold, nothing but a waste of energy, money, and time. Why early a friction had, however another compensation. The incestant mental exertion developed my powers of observation and enabled me to discover a truth of great importance. I had noted that the appearance of images was always preceded by the actual vision of scenes under peculiar and generally very exceptional conditions, and I was impelled on each occasion to locate the original impulse. After a while this effort grew to be almost automatic and I gained great facility in connecting cause and effect. Soon I became aware to my surprise that every thought I conceived was suggested by an external impression. Not only this, but all my actions were prompted in a similar way. In the course of time it became perfectly evident to me that I was merely an anatomitan endowed with power of movement, responding to the stimuli of the sense organs and thinking and acting accordingly. The practical result of this was the art of telodomatics, which has been so far carried out only in an imperfect manner. Its latent possibilities, will, however, be eventually shown. I have been since years planning self-controlled automata and believe that mechanisms can be produced, which will act as if possessed of reason to a limited degree and will create a revolution in many commercial and industrial departments. I was about 12 years old when I first succeeded in banishing an image from my vision by willful effort, but I never had any control over the flashes of light to which I have referred. They were perhaps my strangest experience and inexplicable. They usually occurred when I found myself in a dangerous or distressing situation, or when I was greatly exhilarated. In some instances, I have seen all the air around me filled with tons of living flame. Their intensity, instead of diminishing, increased with time and seemingly attained a maximum when I was about 25 years old. While in Paris, in 1883, a prominent French manufacturer sent me an invitation to a shooting expedition, which I accepted. I had been long confined to the factory and the fresh air had a wonderfully invigorating effect on me. On my return to the city that night I felt a positive sensation that my brain had caught fire. I saw a light as though a small sun was located in it, and I passed the whole night, applying cold compressions to my tortured head. Finally, the flashes diminished in frequency and forests, but it took me more than three weeks before they wholly subsided. When a second invitation was extended to me, my answer was an infatric no. These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, as when a new idea opening a possibility strikes me. But they are no longer exciting, being a relatively small intensity. When I close my eyes, I invariably observe first a background, a very dark and uniform blue, not unlike the sky on a clear but starless night. In a few seconds, this field becomes animated with innumerable, scintillating flakes of green, arranged in several layers and advancing towards me. Then there appears to the right a beautiful pattern of two systems of parallel and closely spaced lines at right angles to one another. In all sorts of colors with yellow green and gold predominating, immediately thereafter, the lines grow brighter, and the whole is thickly sprinkled with thoughts of twinkling light. This picture moves slowly across the field of vision, and in about 10 seconds vanishes to the left, leaving behind a ground of rather unpleasant and inert gray, which quickly gives way to a belowey sea of clouds, seemingly trying to mold themselves in living shapes. It is curious that I cannot project a form into this gray until the second phase is reached. Every time before falling asleep, images of persons or objects flip before my view. When I see them, I know that I am about to lose consciousness. If they are absent and refuse to come, it means a sleepless night. To what an extent imagination played a part in my early life, I may illustrate by another odd experience. Like most children, I was fond of jumping and developed an intense desire to support myself in the air. Occasionally, a strong wind, richly charged with oxygen, blew from the mountains, rendering my body as light as a cork, and then I would leap and float in space for a long time. It was a delightful sensation, and my disappointment was keen when later I undecieved myself. During that period, I contracted many strange likes, dislikes, and habits. Some of which I can trace to external impressions while others are an accountable. I had a violent aversion against the earrings of women. But other ornaments, as bracelets, pleased me more or less according to design. The sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit, but I was fascinated with the glitter of crystals or objects with sharp edges and plain surfaces. I would not touch the hair of other people except, perhaps, at the point of a revolver. I would get a fever by looking at a peach, and if a piece of camphor was anywhere in the house it caused me the keenest discomfort. Even now, I'm not insensible to some of these upsetting impulses. When I drop little squares of paper and a dish filled with liquid, I always sense a peculiar and awful taste of my mouth. I counter the steps in my walks, and calculated the cubicle contents of suit plates, coffee cups, and pieces of food. Otherwise, my meal was unenjoyable. All repeated acts or operations I performed had to be divisible by three, and if I missed, I felt compelled to do it all over again, even if it took hours. Up to the age of eight years, my character was weak and vacillating. I had neither courage nor strength to form a firm resolve. My feelings came in waves and surges, and vibrated unceasingly between extremes. My wishes were of consuming force, and like the heads of a hydra they multiplied. I was oppressed by thoughts of pain in life and death and religious fear. I was swayed by superstitious belief and lived in constant dread of the spirit of evil, of ghosts and ogres and other unholy monsters of the dark. Then, all at once, there came a tremendous change, which altered the course of my whole existence. Of all things I liked books the best. My father had a large library, and whenever I could manage, I tried to satisfy my passion for reading. He did not permit it, and would fly into a rage when he caught me in the act. He hid the candles when he found that I was reading in secret. He did not want me to spoil my eyes, but I obtained talo, made the wicking, and cast the sticks into tin forms, and every night I would bush the keyhole and the cracks in read, often till dawn, when all others slept, and my mother started on her arduous daily task. On one occasion, I came across a novel entitled Abafi, the Son of Abba. A serbian translation of a well-known Hungarian writer, Jossika. This works somehow awaken my dormant powers of will, and I began to practice self-control. At first my resolutions faded like snow and April, but in a little while I conquered my weakness, and I felt pleasure I never knew before that of doing as I willed. In the course of time this vigorous mental exercise became second nature. At the outset my wishes had to be subdued, but gradually desire and will grew to be identical. After years of such discipline I gained so complete a mastery over myself that I toyed with passions which have meant destruction to some of the strongest men. At a certain age I contracted a mania for gambling, which greatly worried my parents. To sit down to a game of cards was for me the quittessence of pleasure. My father led an exemplary life and could not excuse the senseless waste of time and money in which I indulged. I had a strong resolve, but my philosophy was bad. I would say to him, I can stop whenever I please, but is it worthwhile to give up that which I would purchase with the joys of paradise? On frequent occasions he gave vent to his anger and contempt, but my mother was different. She understood the character of men, and knew that one salvation could only be brought about through his own efforts. One afternoon I remember, when I had lost all my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with a role of bills and said, go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess, the better it will be. I know that you will get over it. She was right. I conquered my passion, then and there, and only regretted that it had not been a hundred times as strong. I not only vanquished, but tore it from my heart, so as not to leave even a trace of desire. Ever since that time, I have been as indifferent to any form of gambling as depicting teeth. During another period, I smoked excessively, threatening to ruin my health. Then, my will asserted itself, and I not only stopped, but destroyed all inclination. Along a go, I suffered from heart trouble, until I discovered that it was due to the innocent cup of coffee I consumed every morning. I discontinued at once, though I confess it was not an easy task. In this way, I checked and bridled other habits and passions, and have not only preserved my life, but derived an immense amount of satisfaction from what most men would consider a privation and sacrifice. After finishing the studies at the Polytechnic Institute and University, I had a complete nervous breakdown, and while the Mallody lasted, I observed many phenomena, strange and unbelievable.

Yet slaves, at times, grow mutinous and rebelled, here in this morning hour, from you apart, the mood is on me to be frank and tell the thoughts long hidden deep down in my heart. These thoughts are bitter, thorny plants that grew, below the flowers of praise I plucked for you. As flowery praises lead you to suppose, you were my benefactor. Well, in truth, when lovely woman on dull man bestows sweet favors of her beauty and her youth, he is her debtor. I am yours, and yet you robbed me while you placed me thus, indeed. I owe you for keen moments, when you stirred my senses with your beauty, when your eyes, your wanton eyes, below the prudent word your curled lips uttered. You are worldly wise, and while you like to set men's hearts on flame, you take no risks in that old passion game.

The Night The Mountain Fell; The Story Of The Montana-Yellowstone Earthquake,Edmund Christopherson,86924,1.0,"April 8, 2018",[],0,"main. For more information or to volunteer, please visit librevox.org, recording by David Wales. The night the mountain fell, the story of the Montana Yellowstone earthquake by Edmund Christofferson, Part 1. Real shook. August is a busy month in the exciting mountain vacation area that centers in West Yellowstone, Montana, and includes Yellowstone National Park. The restored ghost town of Virginia City, the nationally famous trout fishing reach of Madison Canyon that runs through the Gallatin National Forest, plus dude ranches and lakes in the parts of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, where the three states come together. Geologically, it is a new area where enormous forces are still thrusting up mountains, where volcanic raiders still exist, and where the heat of the earth still spouts its imprisoned fury through the guisers that have made Yellowstone parks firehole based on famous. At 11.37 pm on Monday, August 17, 1959, one of the severe earthquakes recorded on the North American continent, shook this area. It sent gigantic tidal waves, surging down the seven mile length of a head began lake, throwing an enormous quantity of water over the top of a head began dam. The way you can slosh water out of a dishpan, still keeping it upright. This water described as a wall 20 feet high, swept down the narrow Madison Canyon full of campers and vacationers who were staying in dude ranches, and at three for a service campgrounds along the seven mile stretch from the dam to the point where the canyon opened up into rolling wheat and grazing land. Just about the time this surge of water reached the mouth of the canyon, half of a 7,600 foot eye mountain came crashing down into the valley and cascaded like water up the opposite canyon wall, herdling house size, quartz side, and a Dolomite boulders onto the lower portion of rock Greek campground. This slide dam the river and force the surging water carrying trees, mud and debris back into the campground. The campers who had escaped to being crushed under part of the 44 million cubic yards, 80 million tons of rock found themselves picked up and thrown against trees, cars, trailers, the side of the canyon, etc. Heavy 4,000 pound cars were tossed 40 feet and smashed against trees by the force of the ricocheting water, and the near hurricane velocity went, created by the mountain fall. Other cars were scrunched to suitcase thickness and thrown out from under the slide. And the water stayed held by the earthquake caused natural dam. It began to flood the lower end of the canyon. At the upper end, big sections of the road that would take the 300 people trapped in the canyon to safety, crumpled and fell into head can lake, cutting them off from the world outside. When the quake hit summer alternate ranges, Fred, Tim and Lamont herbald, were on duty at the West Yellowstone entrance of Yellowstone National Park. They had just cleared a semi-load of presto logs, as the truck pulled on through the gate, the plywood gatehouse shook so violently with the lights flashing off and on, that herbald shouted, stop the truck you blank, you've hooked the shack. Truck drivers, Jack and Lyle Tuddle thought the frantic way their truck was flopping around, meant the motor had broken loose from the mounts, driving into the park they were halted by huge rocks blocking the road, renewed shaking with tons more rocks rolling down the mountainside, sent them scurrying for the cover behind trees. Lyle took refuge in a tree where he later said, the shaking seemed twice as rough. When the quaking stopped briefly, they turned the truck around and were happy to get out before more bulldozers blocked their exit. In the confusion that followed, when the first shock hit, Jerry Eder, who operates the duck creek cabins near West Yellowstone, jumped out of bed, and knocked on all the cabin doors to warn the occupants of the quake. Only after he'd finished the job, did he realize that he was wearing no clothes at all. His wife, Iris, ran it onto the front porch. The porch dropped into the basement. She climbed out, got into the car, and didn't stop until she reached Boseman, 90 miles to the north. Just west of the duck creek junction of highways one and one 91, the first shocks wakened Roland Whitman, as it sent dishes and furniture crashing to the floor. When he couldn't reach his wife's folks in the West Yellowstone, 10 miles south by phone, he rushed his wife, Margaret, and their six children into the car, started out, and immediately crashed over a 13-foot drop-off scarf that the quake had jotted up between his home and the highway. On the night of the quake, Mrs. Grace Miller, a widow, who in her 70s is still sprightly enough to run single-handed at the Hillguard fishing lodge cabin and boat rentals on the north shore of Hebgen Lake, found herself suddenly wakened about midnight. She didn't know what was happening, but she felt she had to get out of the house. She threw a blanket around herself, the door was jammed, and she had to kick to get it open. Outside the door, she saw a big five-foot crevice as she leaped across it, the house dropped from under her into the lake. More crevices kept opening in the moonlit ground as she walked away from the lake. Rabbids were skidaddling in every witch direction, she said, but her malamute dog Sandy was so frightened, he wouldn't even notice them. After quite a spell of hiking in the night, Merleite night, she found refuge along with about 40 other people at Kirkwood Ranch, which itself was considerably damaged, but a safe distance from the lake. She was safe there, while next day skinned divers alerted by worried friends, searched her floating house for her body. Later next day, she boated past her nine-room home, which contained everything she owned floating on the lake. My hope is stays upright, she said, my teeth are still on the kitchen counter right next to the sink. When she arrived at the dam, she greeted and acquaintance with, I've been a pretty tough old bird, but I wouldn't want to go through that again. In a forest fire, look out on top of 10,300 foot high, mount homes in Yellowstone Park, the first shock through Penn State College, student David Bittner out of his bunk. By Golly, they'll believe me this time, he said, with satisfaction, as he picked himself up off the floor. Several days earlier, he'd phone to report of substantial tremors, but no one would take his report seriously. Charles Godgann, a chef at the frontier and his wife Ruth, a waitress, were driving home at 11.37. We must have a flat, she said, as the car thumped and shook along the road. When Godgann got out to look, the ground was bucking so strenuously that he could hardly stand up. Back at the frontier, he found steak plates all over the floor. In the establishments walk in freezer, he found the floor covered with mayonnaise, a foot deep. At the Emmett J. Coligan Place, dubbed the Blarny Stone Ranch, the Santa Barbara Waters off an Urtecune spent hundreds of thousands of dollars building a refuge from the possibility of atomic attack. Ironically, the main fault of the earthquake ran through one end of his building cement block foundation, raising the ground 15 feet, twisting and cracking the hole 150 foot length of the building. Ironically, too, Coligan's spread was perhaps the only one, reputed to be covered by earthquake insurance. His caretaking family, John and Doris Russell, were trapped in their cottage and had to crawl out and pass their children through a chin high 15 inch square window. At the proud Dude Ranch Parade Rest, where Bud and Loomores, capitalized on the areas superb fishing, the shock toppled chimneys atop the massive log buildings and sent the guests scurrying outdoors. Huddled around a huge campfire in the courtyard where it seemed safer, they felt bewildered and helpless as the ground continued to heave and ride throughout the night. The showers the shock continued at the rate of one every minute. By morning, the kitchen was a shambles like a cabin a grizzly bear had worked over dishes, flour, everything crashed to the floor. The only thing to do was to clean it up with a broom and shovel. Loomores said, The shelter was built throughout the earthquake area, crockery and goods and glass containers were at a premium, drug stores, bars, groceries were shard-piled shambles. After the quake, the proprietor of the antique shop next to the West Yellowstone post office took one look at the disheartening spectacle of his shop and took off. The floor was strewn with a fortune in broken antique glass and dishware. The ground just got up and bucked like a horse, one West Yellowstone citizen put it. The only man who was enthusiastic about the earthquake from the start was geologist Irving J. Whitkin, the US geological survey, who was living in a trailer on a rise to the north of Hebgen Lake, above the Coligans and Parade Rest, while he surveyed and amapped the area. When the first shock hit, he figured his trailer had somehow broken loose and was rolling down the hill. He charged out and tent on stopping it. From the way the trees were swaying in the absence of any wind, he knew it was a genuine earthquake. He hopped in his Jeep and headed down toward the lake. He saw the scarp that the Whitman soared off just in time to stop. His mind, his mind, he shouted as he got out of the Jeep and realized the full measure of his fortune. His words will echo wherever geologists gather in years to come. Professionally, his once in a thousand lifetime fortune, in being on the scene of a major quake, meant as much as discovering an unthounfairose doom, would to an egyptologist. At mammoth, the old army posed which is still headquarters for Yellowstone Park. Superintendent, Long Harrison, was sitting up in bed reading when the quake hit. His wife and daughter were watching TV when the big chimneys and rocks from the massive old 1909 built Mason rebuilding began crashing through the porches and roofs. We got out and fast. We prided ourselves on being cool. It wasn't for an hour or so that I remember that I was still wearing my park service uniform coat over the JAMA PANTS. Every time there was a new tremor, the coyotes abundant thereabouts would let out a fresh owl. The phone lines to old faithful and West Yellowstone weren't working. The quake had taken them out. They had 18,000 people who were overnighting in the park when the quake began were on the edge of panic. What can we do? How can we get word out? Can we get out? Everyone wanted answers to these questions at once. At old faithful, 800 people were in the recreation hall enjoying a college talent program. In the best entertainment tradition at the MC played at cool, continuing his pattern while the park rangers opened the doors. Everyone exited and good order. But there was to be little comfort that night, everyone who'd made it to bed got up after the first shock. The massive log-built old faithful in, the timbers gave out loud, creaking and popping noises as the structural torment continued. We had to evacuate the building, superintendent Garrison said, The water from a broken pipe in the attic was running down the floor of the east wing. Half an hour later the fireplace and chimney crashed through the dining room floor, activating the sprinkler system. The water damage was horrible. A few hours earlier, with the dining room full, the casually list would have been gruesome. As it was, our only casualty was a woman who sprained her ankle leaping out of bed after the first tremor. Later in the week a ranger exhausted from quake duty skidded on a rangelic pavement and went off the road. We feel that God had his arms around us all the way. The quake continued with special violence at old faithful evacuees from the inn that sat out the night, wrapped in hotel blankets, in their cars, and in the big distinctive Yellowstone Park company buses, trembling with fear at each new quake. At the new Canyon Village, guests were reassured by the big voice to man who in the midst of the turmoil marched up to the reservations desk and demanded accommodations for an additional two nights. Canyon 2 was the place where they say, another guest left a note on his pillow for the chamber made saying, awfully rough bear stayed under my cabin last night had an awfully hard time sleeping, better tell the night man to do something about it. As the shocks continued, the summons to exit us was clear. Quake broken roads blocked all the exits from West Yellowstone, except the route 191 through Idaho, south to Pocatello. The rest of the night it was bright with the lights of cars streaming away from the earthquake country to the solid security and comfort of the outside world. Trapped. The more trailer and tent campers, attractive rock, creek campground, less than a mile from the mouth of a medicine canyon was a favored sight, so much so that it was full most of the summer season. The formal or improved area just pulled off the road and overnighted on any level spot they could find along the road. Two vacationing families, the austs and the Fredericks felt lucky when they found adjacent campsites at rock creek on Monday, August 17, Reverend Elmer asked who teaches psychology at Biblical seminary in New York City and doubles as pastor at Bethany Congregational Church in Corona, Queens, his wife Ruth, youngsters Larry, 14, Geraldine, 13, Joan, 11 and Shirley Six had been enjoying a leisurely camping vacation in the northwest. The Melvin Fredericks family, he's a biscuit salesman for B&B from Eliria, Ohio, included Mrs. Laura Melva, 16, Paul, 15 and George Whitmore, 15, who lives with the Fredericks in Eliria, Ohio, while his folks are missionary in Brazil. The two families met in Columbia Falls, Montana at the home of Reverend Ralph Werner, who was a relative of the Fredericks and a college chum of the austs. They both toured at Glatier National Park and were headed for Yellowstone Park and the Black Hills and decided to camp together the next night. Oast told Fredericks that if you don't make it to Yellowstone Park before noon, the campsites would all be filled. But he knew of camping areas in the Madison Canyon near West Yellowstone and not too far outside the park where they'd be more likely to find room. The austs got to rock-creak campground at 6 o'clock Monday, August 17 found a site in stationed Larry by the road to stop the Fredericks. The two families chose a small open area near the stream and pleasant evergreen trees at the east end of the camp near the entrance. They set up camp eight together, socialized and made plans to get up at 6 o'clock next morning, breakfast on dry cereal and get an early start for Yellowstone. They swapped stories about their vacation, joked about the bear that was supposed to be scavenging around the campground and decided to walk down to the highway where they'd be away from the trees and able to see the moon, which lit the mountain behind them. But the mountain that looked high in the south side of the canyon kept them from seeing the moon directly. They turned in early at 9 o'clock. The two younger oscarols mildly concerned about the bear decided to sleep in the car, a 1950 bui. Larry and Geraldine and their parents all slept in their tent. Mrs. Fredericks and Melva slept in their station wagon while the men stretched out in a tent. Everyone that was an isolated settled at 1137 when a thunder light commotion outside awakened them. Ruth and Jerry Oast shouted something about bears as they jumped out of the tent. Its a cyclone Mrs. Oast was screaming in half awakened terror as Reverend Oast emerged from the tent. The sky was clear the moon bright as Reverend Oast looked up and to the west. There were no clouds or wind. But terror ran through the whole party as they saw tent swaying, tree shaking as though torn in a violent wind. Then the Oast 1950 bui began to rock from front to rear as if men were jumping energetically on the bumpers. The brake lights went on as one of the girls jumped on the brake. Then came a tremendous roar like several expressed trains passing through the camp. The trees shut off their view of the huge 7,600 foot mountain falling of the huge boulders big as houses hurling down one side of the canyon and up the other a mile away throwing sparks and dust as they fell. The Oast sensed the rushing of the wind and water trapped by the avalanching mountain and thrown back at the dazed campers at tornado speeds from under the slide. Hang onto a tree he shouted. Mrs. Oast ran for the car as she saw the wave of water coming. Larry was caught in a tent when the wall of water mud and trees hit them with such violence that it crumpled trailers and hurled the Oast's 4,000 pound car 30 feet and smashed it against a row of trees. The mist's Oast was holding onto the steering wheel the violence of the surging water through her against the side of the car so violently that it made a pulp out of the right side of her face in the midst of the mud, water and floating and flying debris, Larry managed to tear his way out of the tent. From the slide of skewed the moon and heightened the sense of tragedy and terror, the tent was gone. The deluge of water had jammed cars and trailers together. The rocks had covered the side of a trailer where a family had been playing earlier in the day. The night rang out with the bewildered crying out for lost relatives stunned like the others, Reverend Oast shouted for friend, after hitting the brake pedal she jumped out of the car and scampered like a deer to higher ground. He found Jerry unharmed except for being wet and an injury to her hand, sloshing through the water to his knees he found Ruth still on the car. After several minutes hunting and shouting Larry he found his son soaked, clad only in shorts. The screams of the lost and elusing continued a woman handed a baby to Melva Frederick saying comfort him. One day his man walked around crying out for his missing wife. From the wet and dark came the cry of another woman calling out, it's safe here hoping to attract someone to help or keep her company. The Oast women and Mrs. Frederick struggled to hire safer ground when the Frederick's men didn't show up, Oast left the women praying while he went to look for them. He heard Mr. Frederick's call for help for his son Paul. With a flashlight he borrowed he was able to see the difficulty, the surge of water and trees had caught 15 year old Paul and pined him in a sitting position in the water with one log across the small of his back. Another across his lap. The ends of the log were jammed between a smashed trailer and the Oast car so solidly they wouldn't budge. Paul cried out with pain as the two men tried to pull him loose. The water kept rising as the men tried to pry the logs apart with sticks. Two by twelve plank ten feet long, even though full of spikes seemed a promising tool to pry with. But with it they were only able to gain an inch or so further separation of the logs that held Paul prisoner. The men felt Paul's and their own helpless panic as the water swelled up to his chest, his neck, his chin. He was placed in a soundly religious family. Paul bravely faced the realization that he was gasped from death. In desperation, Oast called on male Fredericks to pull as hard as he could not to care if Paul cried or if they pulled his arms or legs out of joint. In this last desperate straining try they found that miraculously they could raise him six inches. They had aboied the trailer. In their next few feverish tries they were able to pull a loose and helped him to walk to high dry ground. One stranded group calling for help included a wheelchair case and mucking shoeless through the water they portaged him out chair and all. George Whitmore had a bad day injured eye from running into a rope and it looked like it might lose its sight. They all moved to the highway which was still dry. A motley crew they were in pajamas or almost unclothed some shoeless. By this time the water had covered their cars. Some of the wounded were taken by car toward Hepkin dam away from the slide. Marooned without their cars in a strange shaking canyon prisoners of a night in which everything seemed mad, somehow word reached them that their ordeal might not be over. There was possibility that a dam several miles upstream which they'd never seen was likely to give away in a minute. They scrambled up the sagebrush hillside and built a fire on a level and fairly open sight. Others joined the two families, one group whose car hadn't been flooded so suddenly managed to save groceries, a camp stove, sleeping bags, pans and a 9 by 12 foot plastic tarp. Without worrying about modesty they'd ride themselves around the fire. There were 17 in the party, it cleared and then clouds obscured the moon. The ground kept shaking with almost every new tremor came sparks and puffs of dust and the terrifying crashing echoes of another avalanche across the valley and the realization that the valley side above them might go any time. The air was full of dust and the sickening smell of mud and torn fur trees. All through the night they heard the haunting cries of help, help were freezing from the grover moths who'd been marooned on top of their trailer and by this time were hanging onto a tree. They worried about forest fires and sang hymns to keep up their courage. At 3 a.m., there was a thunderstorm and a light continuing rain. They huddled under the plastic tarp all 21 of them and wondered what would happen next. And elderly couple, the grover, seen moths, a 72 year old retired decorator and his wife, Lillian, 68 of Temple City, California, had part to their trailer at this scenic rock creek campground for a week before the especially beautiful bright moonlit night of August 17. There were lots of bears in the area and like many other campers when the first jolt hit them, they figured that the bears were trying to get into their trailer. No, it must be an earthquake, Mrs. Malt said. Looking out through the trailer window, the moon made it seem like daylight. Everything was going upside down. An instant later their trailer was tossed in over in, landing miraculously on its wheels, then it seemed as though something picked the trailer up and hurled it into the water. Malt got his 90-clad misses out of the trailer and lifted her on top and went back into the trailer to get sweaters or something. It suddenly turned dark. The moon disappeared in dust. The water had risen to Malt's chin by the time he got out of the trailer. By the time he'd crawled on the trailer roof, put on trousers, a shirt and sweater, and wrapped clothing around his wife's legs, the water was beginning to cover the trailer roof and rising fast. They prayed that the trailer would drift toward a nearby tree. It did. The first branch broke as Malt grabbed it. He barely had time to get one arm around the tree and hold onto his wife with the other when the trailer was swept out from under them. It was horrible, he said. As I tried to pull the misses up, the limbs kept breaking off. I tried to grab higher limbs and cling to the misses with my legs. The limbs still kept breaking off. Finally, we found a limb that would hold. We were surrounded by deep water. Through the night we haulered and hauled for help, people tried to get to us with ropes couldn't reach us and yelled that we should hang on they were going for a boat. While we struggled to hold on, we could see the mountains sliding and falling every few minutes. There'd be a terrific roar followed by more slides. I thought the world was coming to an end. It turned hazy with thunder, lightning, then began to rain. As we clung to the tree with water up to our necks, my wife slipped under three or four times. The last time she was gasping for breath, I managed to pull her out. Let me go and save yourself, she begged, if you go, I'll go to, I told her. About 8 or 8, 30 in the morning, they came for us in a boat. It was just in time. We couldn't have held out for another 10 minutes. The water was rising so fast that the rescuers had to move their truck three times before they could unload the boat. At first, when rescued, we could see lights, then everything went black. We couldn't hear anything over the roar of the tumbling mountains. We were froze stiff from hanging on so long. We couldn't move our legs. The men had to help us get into the boat. In contrast to those who stood around and wondered, was LD Smith of Greeley Colorado, who with his family was camped in a trailer at the Beaver Creek campground, a couple of miles downstream from Edgandam. The loud noise and rumbling woke him. Outside the trailer, he found the water rising. The ground was shaking violently. He didn't know what was causing it, but his first thought was that the dam had broken. The steep walled canyon didn't seem like a safe place for his family. As soon as the shaking subsided temporarily, he loaded his wife and two youngsters into the car and drove away from the dam. The collapse of which he instinctively felt was the greatest danger as fast as he could. A mile or two before he reached the slide, he ran into heavy dust. Still fearful of what the dam's collapsed would mean for those trapped in the deep canyon. When the slide blocked his path, he turned off the road and drove up the north side of the canyon wall to a point where he couldn't get any more traction. He then got his family out of the car and moved them to still higher ground. Later in the evening, his family joined the aws and Fredericks around the fire on the hillside. About 8 o'clock on the same gorgeous moonlit night of August 17, the early Bennett family of Gourde Delane Idaho pulled their trailer off alongside the road on the flat at the mouth of the medicine canyon. Canyon, Gourde. They didn't plan to set up camp just to rest for a few hours before continuing to the park. They talked a bit with others, camped in the same informal area, then it turned in. Early a 43-year-old truck driver and his wife Irene slept in the trailer, the youngsters, a carol 17, Philip 15, Tom 10 and Susan 5 stretched out in bed rolls outside on the ground. They were awakened a little before midnight by a loud rumbling noise. They wondered what it was, but weren't concerned enough to get up or move their equipment. Some time later in response to a much louder noise, Bennett left the trailer to see about the children. Mrs. Bennett was right behind him. As she stepped out of the trailer, she felt a strong wind coming up. There was a great rumbling, whushing sound, and as the wind reached hurricane velocity, she saw her husband grab a small tree for support. When swept him off his feet, he hung on like a flag tied to a mast. After a little bit he let go and was blown away. She never saw him again. She couldn't see her children except one flying through the air. A car was blown by, rolling over and over, and she found herself swept along with the trees, the rocks and water. When I came to, she said, I was jammed against a tree with a log on my back. I don't know how I got out. I thought I was the only one of my family still alive. Then, over the awful morning of the boulders, a grinding and crashing, and the sound of the tree trunks howling through the air, she heard the voice of her son Philip calling. Slowly, painfully, in spite of crippling injuries, they dragged an inch at a time toward one another over the rocky oozee bed of the river, which the huge slide had instantaneously stopped. Highway Patrolman Stevens, who found them several hours later, noticed how torn their hands were from this agonizing crawl. That morning, in the hospital at NS, Mrs. Bennett told reporters, they say my husband and my boys are dead, but I have faith. I know they will be found. They already had been dead, and part one.","Nature, Technology & Engineering, Modern (20th C)",English,01:55:59,David Wales,"['North American', 'Greek', 'Coligans']","['Tim', 'Rabbids', 'Godgann', 'Gourde Delane Idaho', 'George Whitmore', 'Doris Russell', 'Jerry', 'Irene', 'John', 'Philip', 'Irving J.

A Daily Rate by Grace Livingston Hill. Chapter 1 The world would not have looked quite so dreary to her perhaps if it had not been her birthday. Somehow one persists in expecting something unusual to happen on a birthday, no matter how many times one has had nothing but disappointment. Not that Celia Murray was really expecting anything even a letter on this birthday, though she did stand shivering in the half light of the dim, for Lauren front room that served as a parlor for Mrs. Morris's boarding house, watching for the postman to reach their door. She did it merely because she wished to be near to get the letter at once, provided there was a letter, and not that she really hoped for one. It was Saturday evening, and the close of a half holiday in the store in which she usually stood all day long as saleswoman. The unusual half holiday off was on account of some parade in the city. Celia had not spent her afternoon at the parade. Instead she had been in her small, cold, back bedroom in the third story, attending to various worn garments which needed mending. They had been spread out on the bed in a row, and she had gone steadily down the line, putting in a few stitches here, a button there, and setting in a patch in another, counting every minute of daylight, hoping to finish her work before it faded. For the gas in her room was dim, the burner being old and worn out. She tried to be gay over the work. She called it her dress parade. She knew it was the best way in which to accomplish as much as she wished to do. And now it was six o'clock, and she had turned down the wretched flickering light in her room and descended to the parlor to watch for the postman. He was late tonight, probably on account of the parade. She leaned her forehead against the cold glass and looked out into the misty darkness. Everything was murky and smoky. The passers by seemed tired and in a hurry. Some had their collars turned up. She wondered where they were all going, and whether there were pleasant homes waiting for them. She let her imagination picture the homes of some. There was a young working man hurrying along with breezy step and swinging dinner pale. He had not been to the parade. His parade was at home awaiting his coming, a laughing baby, a tidy wife, and the house read a lint of fried onions and sausage. She had passed houses often at night where those orders were streaming forth from quickly opened and closed doors. The young man would like it. It would be pleasant to him. And the thought brought no less cheer to the watching girl, because to her, this supper would not be in the least appetizing. Their past-by a strungled German, a day laborer perhaps. She pictured the table full of noisy children of various ages, and the abundance of sour crowd and cheese and coffee and other vions set out. Then came a stream of girls, some clerks like herself, and some mill girls. On other evenings, they would present a different appearance, but many of them tonight were in holiday attire on account of the half holiday which had been generally given throughout the city. These girls, some of them, had homes of more or less attractiveness, and others like herself were domiciled in boarding houses. She sat down on one of the hard-haired cloth chairs and looked around that parlor. In the dimness of the turned down gas, it appeared more forlorn than usual. The ingrained carpet had long ago lost any claims to respect ability. It had a dragged out, sod and appearance, and in places there were unmistakable holes. These, it is true, had been twisted and turned about, so as to come mostly under the tables in sofa, but they were generally visible to the casual observer. The parlor suite of hair cloth, by reason of being much sat upon, had lost the spring of youth, and several of the chairs, and one end of the sofa looked like fallen cake. There was an asmatic cabinet organ at the end of the room, which had been left by some departing border under compulsion in lieu of his board. There were a few worn pieces of music scattered upon it. Celia knew that the piece now open on the top was that choice selection, the cat came back, which was a great favorite with a young railroad breakman who had a metallic tenor voice and good lungs. He was one of the borders and considered quite a singer in the house. There was a feeble attempt at the aesthetic in the form of a red be-dragled shenil portier at the doorway, bordered with large pink cabbage roses. The mantle had a worn plush scarf embroidered in a style quite out of date and ugly in the extreme. On it stood a large glass case of wax flowers, several cheap vases, and a match safe. Over it hung a crayon portrait of the land ladies departed husband, and another of herself adorned the opposite wall, both done in steering crayon work from tin types of ancient date, heavily and cheaply framed. These, with a marriage certificate of the classed hand and orange-reath order, framed in guilt, made up the adornments of the room. Celia sighed as she looked about and took it all in once more. It was a dreary place. She had been in it but a week. Would she ever get used to it? She did not curl her lip in scorn as many other girls would have done over that room and its furnishings. Neither did she feel that utter distaste that is akin to hatred. Instead, it was a kind of pity in her heart for it all, and for the poor lonely creatures who had no other place to call home. Where there is such pity, there is sometimes love not far away. She even rose, went to the doorway and looped the loose discouraged folds of the shenil curtain in more graceful fashion. Somehow her fingers could not help doing so much toward making that room different. Then she sighed and went to the window again. She could see the belated post-man now across the street. She watched him as he flitted back and forth, ringing this bell and that, and searching in the great leather bag for papers or packages. His breath showed white against the dark grayish blue of the misty evening air. His gray uniform seemed to be a part of the mist. The yellow glare of the street lamp touched the gild buttons and made a bright spot of the letters on his cap as he paused a moment to study and address before coming to their door. Celia opened the door before he had time to ring and took the letters from his hand. There were not many. The borders in that house had not many correspondence. She stepped into the parlor once more and turned up the gas now for a moment to see if there were any for herself. Strange to say there were two, rather thin and unpromising it is true, but they gave a little touch of the unusual to the dull day. She noticed that one more familiar postmark and was in her aunts writing. The other held the citymark and seemed to be from some firm of lawyers. She did not feel much curiosity concerning it. It was probably some circular. It did not look in the least interesting. She pushed them both quickly into her pocket as the front door opened, letting in several noisy borders. She did not wish to read her letters in public. They would keep till after supper. The bell was already ringing. It would not be worthwhile to go upstairs before she went to the dining room. Experience taught her that the supper was at its very worst the minute after the bell rang. If one waited, one must take the consequences. And the consequences were not desirable. The meals in that house were not too tempting at any time, not that she cared much for her supper. She was too weary, but one must eat to live, and so she went to the dining room. Out there the gas was turned to its highest. The coarse tablecloth was none of the cleanest. In fact it reminded one of former breakfasts and dinners. The thick white dishes bore marks of hard usage. They were nicked and cracked. There were plates of heavy, sour looking bread at either end of the table. The butter looked mussey and unenviting. The inevitable scanty supply of prunes stood before the plate of the young German clerk. Who was already in his chair helping himself to a liberal dish. The German clerk was fond of prunes and always got to the table before anyone else. Some of the others could naturally call himself fish and frequently passed meaning remarks veiled in thin jokes, concerning this habit of his. But if he understood he kept the matter to himself and was apparently not thin-skinned. There was a stufordiner that night. Celia dreaded stews since the night of her arrival when she had found a long curly hair on her plate in the gravy. There were such possibilities of utility in a stew. It was brought on in little thick white dishes, dulled out in exact portions. There were great green fat pickles suggesting copper in their pickling and there was a plate of cheese and another of crackers. A girl brought each one a small spoonful of canned corn, but it was cold and scarcely cooked it all. And the kernels were large and whole. Celia having tasted it pushed her dish back and did not touch it again. On the side table was a row of plates, each containing a slim thin piece of pale-crested pie. It's interior being dark and of an undefined character. Celia tried to eat. The dishes were not all clean. Her spoon had a sticky handle and so had her fork. The silver was all worn off the blade of her knife and she could not help thinking that perhaps it was done by being constantly used to convey food to the mouth of the breakman with the tenor voice. One by one the borders drifted in. It was surprising how quickly they gathered after that bell rang. They knew what they had to depend upon in the way of bread and butter and it was first come first served. Little Miss Burns sat across the table from Celia. She was thin and nervous and laughed a good deal in an excited way as if everything were unusually funny and she were in a constant state of embarrassing apology. There were tired little lines around her eyes and her mouth still wore a baby droop, though she was well a long in years. Celia noticed that she drank only a cup of tea and nibbled a cracker. She did not look well. It was plain the dinner was no more appetizing to her than to the young girl who had so recently come there to board. She ought to have some delicate thin slices of nicely browned toast and a cup of good tea with real cream in it and a fresh egg poached just right or a tiny cup of good strong beef bouillon. Celia said to herself, she amused herself by thinking how she would like to slip out in the kitchen and get them for her. Only, and she almost smiled at the thought, she would hardly find the necessary articles with which to make all that out in the Morris kitchen. Next to Miss Burns sat two young girls clerks in a three-cent store. They carried a good deal of woodbee style and wore many bright rings on their grimy fingers whose nails were never cleaned nor cut up apparently except by their teeth. These girls were rather pretty in a coarse way and laughed and talked a good deal in loud tones with the tender break man whose name was Bob Yates and with the other young men borders. These young men were respectively a clerk in a department store, a student in the university, and a young teacher in the public schools. Celia noticed that neither the student nor the school teacher ate heartily and that the young dry good salesman had a hollow cough. How nice it would be if they all could have a good dinner just for once. Soup and roast beef and good bread and vegetables with a delicious old-fashioned apple dumpling smoking hot, such as her aunt Hannah could make. How she would enjoy giving it to them all. How she would like to eat some of it herself. She sighed as she pushed back her plate with a good half of the stew yet untouched and felt that it was impossible to eat another mouth full of that. Then she felt ashamed to think she cared so much for mere eating and tried to talk pleasantly to the little old lady beside her who occupied a small dismal room on the third floor and seemed to stay in it most of the time. Celia had not yet found out her occupation nor her standing in society, but she noticed that she trembled when she tried to cut her meat, and she was shabby clothed in rusty black that looked as if it had served its time out several times over. Mrs. Morris came into the dining room when the pie was being served. She was large and worried looking and wore a soiled calico wrapper without a collar. Her hair had not been combed since morning and some locks had escaped in her neck and on her forehead and added to her generally dejected appearance. She sat down heavily and weirally at the head of the table and added her spiritless voice to the conversation. She asked them all how they enjoyed the parade and declared it would have been enough parade for her if she could have set down for a couple of hours. Then she's side and drink a cup of tea from her saucer holding the saucer on the palm of her hand. It all looked hopelessly dreary to Celia and here she expected to spend the home part of her life for several years at least, or if not here yet in some place equally destitute of anything which constitutes a home. Except for her brief conversation with the old lady on her right and a few words to Miss Burns, she had spoken to no one during the meal. And as soon as she had excused herself from the pie and folded her napkin, she slipped upstairs to her room for the thought of the two letters in her pocket seemed more inviting than the pie. She turned the gas to its highest though it did screech that she might see to read her letters and then she drew them forth. Her antennas came first. She tore the envelope only one sheet and not much written there on. Antana was well but very busy for netty's children were all down with woping cough and the baby had been quite sick for little thing and she's had no time to write. Hi-Rum, netty's husband, two had been ill and laid up for a week, so Antana had been nursing night and day. She enclosed a little bookmark to remember Celia's birthday. She wished she could send her something nice, but times were hard and Celia knew she had no money, so she must take it out in love. Hi-Rum's sickness and the doctors bills made things close for netty, or she would have remembered the birthday to perhaps. Antana felt that it was hard to have to be a burden on netty, now when the children were young and she and Hi-Rum needed every send he could earn, but what else could she do? She sent her love to her dear girl, however, and wanted her to read the verse on the little ribbon enclosed, and perhaps it would do her good. She hoped Celia had a nice comfortable homey place to board and would write soon. That was all. The white ribbon bookmark was of satin and bore these words. His allowance was a continual allowance, a daily rate, second Kings 2530, and beneath in smaller letters, charge not thyself with the weight of a year, child of the master, faithful and dear, choose not the cross for the coming week, for that is more than he bids the seek. Bend not thine arms for tomorrow's load, thou mist leave that to thy gracious God, daily only he says to thee, take up thy cross and follow me.

Gorgons and Hydras and Shemaras. Dyer stories of Salano and the Harpies may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition, but they were there before. They are transcripts, types, the archetypes are in us and eternal. How else should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to effect us all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? Oh, least of all. These terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body or without the body they would have been the same. That the kind of fear here treated is purely spiritual, that it is strong and proportioned as it is objectless on earth, that it predominated in the period of our senseless infancy, or difficulties the solution of which might afford some probable insight into our anti-Mundane condition and a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence. Charles Lamb. Part 1. When a traveler in North Central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of the Ale's very pike, just beyond Dean's corners, he comes upon a lonely and curious country. The ground gets higher and the briar bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren, while the sparsely scattered houses, wear a surprising uniform aspect of age, squaller and dilapidation. Without knowing why, one has a taste to ask directions from the Norl to solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps are in the sloping rock-strown meadows. Those figures are so silent and fertive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with a special clearness, the queer circles of tall, stone pillars with which most of them are crowned. Gorgeous and ravines of problematic depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again, there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears that evening when unseen wipperwills, chatter, at the far-flies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the rocky, creepy, insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs. The thin, shining line of the mischotonic supper reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it lines close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises. As the hills draw nearer, one heats their wooded sides more than their stone crowned tops. Though sides loom up so darkly and so precipitously, that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. Across a covered bridge, one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of round mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting, gembral roofs, bespeaking and earlier architectural period, and that of the neighboring region. It is not reassuring to see on a closer glance that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken steeple church now harbors the one slavantly murkantile establishment of the hamlet. One dreads to trust the tenor of rust tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, maligned odor about the village street, as of the mast mold and decay of centuries. It is almost a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond, till it rejoins the ale-spary pike. Afterward, one sometimes learns that one has been through done-witch. Outsideers visit done-witch as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror, all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down. The scenery judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon is more than uncommonly beautiful, yet there is no influx of artists or some or tourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch blood, Satan worship and strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age, since the done-witch horror of 1928, was hushed up by those who had the towns and the world's welfare at heart, people shun it without knowing exactly why. Perhaps one reason, though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers, is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical stigma of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence is woefully low, whilst their annals wreak of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incest and deeds of almost unnamed of violence and diversity. The old gentry, representing the two or three armages families which came from Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay, though many branches are sunk into the started populist so deeply, but only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of the waddleys and bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and biscotonic, though those sons seldom return to the moldering Gambrill roofs under which they and their ancestors were born. No one, even those who have the facts concerning their recent horror, and say just what is the matter with done which, though old legends speak of unhallowed rights and conclades of the Indians amid which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and bade wild, orgastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumbling from the ground below. In 1747, the reverent Abajah, Holy, newly come to the congregational church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his amps, in which he said, it must be allowed that these blasphemies of an infernal train of demons are matters of two common knowledge to be denied. The cursed voices of Azazel and Burrell and Biel's Bob and Belaya, being heard from underground by Abavay's score of credible witnesses now living. I myself did not more than a fortnotico catch a very plain discourse of evil powers in the hill behind my house, wherein there were a rattling and rolling, roaming, screeching and hissing, such as no things of this earth could raise up, and which must needs have come from those caves that only black magic can discover, and only the devil unlock. Mr. Holy disappeared soon after delivering this sermon, but the text printed in Springfield is still extant. Noise is in the hills continue to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers. Other traditions tell of foul odors near the hill crowning circles of stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the Great Revenes, while still others try to explain the devil's hopyard, a bleak blasted hillside where no tree shrub our grass-blade will grow. Then to the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whipper wills, which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are psychopaths lying in weight for the souls of the dying, and that they time their airy cries in unison with the sufferers struggling breath. If they can catch the fleeting soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away, cheering in demonic laughter, but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence. These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous, because they come down from very old times. Dun witches, indeed, ridiculously old, older by far than any of the communities within 30 miles of it. South of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before 1,700, while the ruins of the mill at the falls built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the 19th century factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great rings of rough, unestone columns on the hilltop's, but these are more generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and bones found within these circles and around the sizable table-like rock on central hill sustained the popular belief at such spots, where once the burial places of the Pekomtux, even though many ethnologists disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory persist in believing the remains Caucasian. Part II. It was in the township of Dunwich in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Watley was born at 5am on Sunday the 2nd of February 1913. This state was recalled because it was candlemuss, which people in Dunwich curiously observed under another name, and because the noise is in the hill had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Watley's, a somewhat deformed unattractive Albino woman of 35, living with an age and half in St. Father, about home the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavenia Watley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region, made no attempt to disobey the child, concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might end it speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seems strangely proud of the dark, go-touch-looking infant who forms such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was hurt to modern many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future. Lavenia was one who would be apt to modern such things, for she was a lone creature given to wondering amid thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great Otoriss books, which her father had inherited through two centuries of Watley's, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes. She had never been to school, but was filled with this jointed scraps of ancient lore that old Watley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of old Watley's reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Watley when Lavenia was 12 years old had not helped to make the place popular. I saladed among strange influences, Lavenia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular occupations. Nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares, in a home from which all standards of order and clenliness had long since disappeared. There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs barking on the night, Wilbur was born, but no-known doctor or midwife presided at his coming. Neighbors knew nothing of him till a week afterward when Old Watley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and discourseed incoherently to a group of loungers that Oz Barnes' general store. There seemed to be a change in the old man, an added element of purtiveness in the clouded brain, which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear. Though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. A mid-adall, he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he set of the child's paternity was remembered by many of his heroes years afterward. I don't care what folks think of Lavenia's boy. If Lavenia's boy looked like his paw he wouldn't look like nothing yet, expect. Yee-need and think the only folks is the folks here about. Lavenia's red son and has seen something the most de-only tell about. I calculate how man is as good a husband as he can find this side of Al-Spary, and if he knows as much about the hills as I do, he wouldn't ask no better church wet in our hern. Let me tell you something. Some day, you folks will hear a child of Lavenia's accoll and its father's name on the top of Sitno Hill. The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old Zachary Wattley of the Undecayed Wattley's and Earl Sawyer's common law wife, Mami Bishop. Mami's visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations. But Zacharyer came to lead a pair of elderly cows, which old Wattley had bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of cattle buying on the part of Small Wilbur's farm, which ended only in 1928 when the Dunn which horror came and went. Yet at no time did the ram shackle Wattley barn, same overcrowded with livestock. There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve a neemic bloodless looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pastridge or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Wattley animals. Odd wounds or sores having something of the aspect of incisions seemed to afflict the visible cattle, and once or twice during the earlier months, certain callers' fancy they could discern similar sores about the throats of the gray, unshaving old man and his slatternly, crackle-haired, albino-daughter. In the spring, after Wilbur's birth, Levenia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her mis-proportioned arms the sworthy child. Public interest in the Wattley's subsided after most of the country folks had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur's growth was indeed phenomenal. For within three months of his birth, he had attained a size and muscular power, not usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his focal chords showed a restraint and de-liberteness, highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove. It was somewhat after this time, on Halloween, that a great place was seen at midnight on the top of sentinel hill, but the old table-like stone stands amid its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop of the undecayed bishops, mentioned having seen the bar running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother, about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the damn light of his lantern. They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watchers seemed to think they were entirely unclosed. Afterward, he could not be sure about the bar who may have had some kind of a fringe to belt and a pair of dark blue trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire. The disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which, always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons. The next January, Gossips were mildly interested in the fact that Levinius Black Brat had commenced to talk, and at the age of only 11 months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative. Yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpazessed by Dunwich and his denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used, but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation, or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect too was remarkable for its maturity. For though he shared his mother's and grandfather's chenelessness, his firm and precosiously shaped nose united with the expression on his large, dark almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi adulthood and well-nipreturnatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly, despite his appearance of brillency. There being something almost godish or animalistic about his thick lips, large poor, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair and oddly elongated ears. He was soon just like even more decidedly than his mother and grand-sire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bighorn magic of old waddley, and how the hills once shook when he screeched the dreadful name of a yag-sothoth, in the midst of a circle of stones, with a great book open in his arm as before him. Dogs of horde of the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking minutes. Part 3. Meanwhile, old waddley continued to buy cattle without measureably increasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house. A spacious, peaked roofed fair, whose rarion was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three least ruined ground floor rooms, had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labor, and though he babbled emintedly at times, his carpentry seemed to show the effects of sound calculation. It had really begun as soon as Wilbur was born when one of the many tools sheaths had been put suddenly in order, clapped boarded and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman. His mania showed itself only in his tight boarding up of all the windows in the reclaimed section, though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all. Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson. A room which several colors saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story. This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving, along which he began gradually to arrange in a apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books, which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms. I made some use of him. He would say as he tried to mend a torn black letter page with paste prepared on the rustic kitchen stove, but the boys fit in to make better use of them. He order have him as well sought as he can for there going to be all of his learning. When Wilbur was a year and seven months old, in September of 1914, his size and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wonderings. At home, he would pour diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather's books, while old Wattley would instruct and cataclyse him through long-hushed afternoon. By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill, and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this works completion, people noticed that the old two house, tightly locked and windlessly clapported, since Wilbur's birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Oll Wattley, he was quite discomposed by the singular odor he encountered. Such a stench he ever heard, as he had never before smelled in all his life, except in the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth. But then the homes and sheds have done which folk have never been remarkable for Oll factory amaculantness. The following months were void of visible events, saved that everyone's swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill doys. On May Eve of 1915, there were tremors which even the ale-spary people felt, whilst the following Halloween produced an underground rumbling, clearly synchronized with bursts of flame, then which waddlies doens from the summed of sentinel hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily so that he looked like a boy of tin as he entered his fourth year. He read, avidly by himself now, but talked much less than formally. A settled test eternity was absorbing him, and for the first time, people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his go-to-shface. He was sometimes moderate unfamiliar jargon and chant in bizarre rhythms which chill the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror. The aversion displayed to Artyam by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of K9 Guardians. The few colors at the house were often fined, Levine alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded up second story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there. Though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear, when a jacose fish-pedalur tried the locked or leading to the stairway. That pedaler told the store loungers had done which village, that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above. The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and run away end of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuttered as they recalled tales of old waddley's youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole waddley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally. In 1917 the war came and squire sire waddley as chairman of the local draft board, at hard work finding a quote of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp. The government alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence, said several officers and medical experts to investigate, conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this investigation, which set reporters on the track of the waddley's and caused the Boston Globe and Orcom advertiser to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur's precosiousness, old waddley's black magic, the shelves, the strange books, the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a half then and looked like a lad of 15. His lip and cheek were fuzzy with a coarse dark down and his voice had begun to break. Earl Saur went out to the waddley place with both sets of reporters in cameraman and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the tool she had abandoned when the house was finally repaired and like the faint odors which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles of the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared and grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered too why the writers made so much of the fact that Earl waddley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The waddley's had received their visitors with ill-conceived distaste though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk. Part four. Faraddecket the animals of the waddley's sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their may-e even all hollow argy's. Twice a year they would light fires on the top of sentinel hill at which times the mountain rumblings would recar with greater and greater violence while at all seasons there were strange and pertentous doings at the lonely farmhouse. In the course of time, callers profess to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals but nothing ever came of it since done which folk are never anxious to call the outside world attention to themselves. About 1923 when Wilbur was a boy of tin whose mind, voice, stature and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper part and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the peat roof. They had torn down the great central chimney too and fitted the rusty rains with their flimsy outside tin stove pipe. In the spring after this event, old wattily noticed the growing number of wipper wheels that would come out of coal spring-blin to chirp under his window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstances one of great significance and told the loungers at Osbourne's that he thought his time had almost come. They whistled just in tune with my breathing now, he said, and I guess they're getting ready to catch my soul. They know it's going out and don't calculate the miss it. You know boys, order I'm going, whether they get me or not. If they do, they'll keep up a singing and laughing till break a day. If they don't, they'll kind of quiet down like. I expect them and the souls they huts for have some pretty tough tussle sometimes. On Lomus night, 1924, Dr. Houten of Elzbury was hastily summoned by Wilbur Wattley, where last his one remaining horse threw the darkness and telephone from Osbourne's in the village. He found old wattley in a very grave state with a cardiac action and Stentaurus breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless Albino daughter and Arlie Bearded grandson stood by the bedside whilst from the vacant abyss overhead. Their came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping as of the waves on some level beach. The doctor though was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside, a seemingly limitless legion of Whipper-Wills that cried their endless message, it repretitions, timed diabolically to the weasing gasp of the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural. Too much thought Dr. Houten, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call. Toward one o'clock, O'Wattley gained consciousness and interrupted his weasing to choke out a few words to his grandson. More space, Willie, more space soon, you grows and that grows faster. It'll be ready to serve you soon, boy. Hoping up the gaze to your south-hoth, with the long chant that you'll find on page 751 of the complete edition, and then put a match to the prison fire from Arthain, Burnett, Nohow. But he was obviously quite mad after a pause during which the flock of Whipper-Wills outside adjusted their cries to the altar-tempel while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off. He added another sentence or two. Feed regular, Willie and mine, the quantity, but don't let it grow too fast for the place. For if it bus squatters and gets out of four yopens to yog, south-hoth, it's all over in no use. Only them from beyond can make it multiply and work. Only them, the oldens as was to come back. But speech gave place to gasps again, and the venius screamed at the way the Whipper-Wills followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour when the final Therodhi Rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly. They didn't get him. He muttered in his heavy base voice. Wilbur was by this time, a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians and distant places, where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around on which because of certain youthful disappearances, which suspicion laid vaguely at his door, but was always able to silence inquiry through fear, or through use of that fund of old time-gold which still, as in his grandfather's time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle buying. He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height having reached the normal adult height seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In 1925, when a scholarly correspondent from mischotonic university called upon him one day, and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three-quarters feet tall. Through all the years, Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother with growing contempt, fairly forbidding her to go to the hills with him on May Eve and Halomass, and in 1926, the poor creature complained to Maymy Bishop of being afraid of him. There's more about him as I know, as Denak to tell you, Maymy, she says, ah, nowadays there's more nor what I know myself. I evolve a foregard, I don't know what he wants, nor what he's trying to do. That Halloween the hill noise is sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on central hill as usual, but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally-related wipper-wills, which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted wattly farmhouse. After midnight, their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandemic-cackenation which filled all the countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quieted down. Then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a moth overdue. What this myth, no one could quite be certain till later. None of the country folks seem to have died, but poor, Lavignee Wattly, the twisted albino, was never seen again. In the summer of 1927, Wilbur repaired tooth sheds in the farm yard, and began moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward, Earl Sawyer told the loungers at Osborne's that more carpentry was going on in the Wattly farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out portitions, as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusual to worry and tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother's disappearance, and very few ever approached his neighborhood now. His height had increased more than seven feet, and showed no signs of ceasing its development.

In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the 16th century, a boy was born to a poor family of the name of Kanti, who did not want him. On the same day, another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him. All England wanted him too. England had so longed for him and hoped for him and prayed God for him that now that he was really come, the people went nearly mad for joy. Miracquincences hugged and kissed each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday and high-end low, rich and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow. And they kept the supper days and nights together. By day, London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony in house top, and splendid pagants marching along. By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revelers making Mary around them. There was no talk in all England, but of the new baby. Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and sattens, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him, and not caring either. But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of poppers, whom he had just come to trouble with his presence. Chapter 2 Tom's Early Life Let us skip a number of years. London was 1,500 years old and was a great town. For that day, it had a 100,000 inhabitants, something double as many. The streets were very narrow and crooked, and dirty, especially in the part where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge. The houses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first, and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second. The higher the houses grew, the broader they grew. They were skeletons of strong, criss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster. The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the understaste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look. The windows were small, glazed with little diamond-shaped pains, and they opened outward on hinges like doors. The house which Tom's father lived in was a buffalo little pocket called awful court, out of putting land. It was small, decayed and rickety, but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty's tribe occupied a room on the third floor. The mother and father had a sort of bedstead in the corner, but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters, bet and nan, were not restricted. They had all the floor to themselves, and might sleep where they chose. There were the remains of a blanket or two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not rightly be called beds, for they were not organized. They were kicked into a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at night, for service. That and nan were 15 years old, twins. They were good-hearted girls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant. Their mother was like them, but the father and the grandmother were a couple of feans. They got drunk whenever they could. Then they fought each other, or anybody else who came in the way. They cursed and swore always, drunk or sober. John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar. They made beggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them. Among, but not of the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old priest whom the king had turned out of house and home, with a pension of a few farthings, and he used to get the children aside, and teach them right ways secretly. Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and how to read and write, and would have done the same with the girls, but they were afraid of the years of their friends, who could not have endured such a queer accomplishment in them. All awful court was just such another hive as Canty's house, drunkenness, riot, and brawling were the order there, every night, and nearly all night long. Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place. Yet little Tom was not unhappy. He had a hard time of it, but did not know it. It was the sort of time that all the awful court boys had. Therefore, he suppose that was the correct and comfortable thing. When he came home empty handed at night, he knew his father would curse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful grand mother would do it all over again, and improve on it. And that, away in the night, his starving mother would slip to him stealthily, with any miserable scrap or crest she had been able to save for him by going hungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of chasin, and soundly beaten for it by her husband. No, Tom's life went along well enough, especially in summer. He only begged just enough to save himself, for the laws against Mendocansi were stringent, and penalties heavy. So he put in a good deal of his time listening to good father Andrews charming old tales and legends about giants and fairies, dwarfs and genie, and enchanted castles, and gorgeous kings and princes. His head grew to be full of these wonderful things, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing. He unleashed his imagination, and soon forgot his aches and pains and delicious pictureings to himself, of the charm's life of a petted prince, in a regal palace. One desire came in time to haunt him day and night. It was to see a real prince, with his own eyes. He spoke of it once to some of his awful court comrades, but they jirred him, and scoffed him so unmercifully, that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that. He often read the priest's old books, and got him to explain and enlarge upon them. His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him, by and by. His dream people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad. He went on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too. But instead of splashing around in the tames solely for the fun of it, he began to find an added value in it, because of the washings and cleansings that afforded. Tom could always find something going on around the maple and cheap side, and at the fares. And now and then, he and the rest of London had a chance to see a military parade, when some famous unfortunate was carried prisoner to the tower, by land or by boat. One summer's day, he saw poor Anne Escu and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and heard an ex-bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him. Yes, Tom's life was varied and pleasant enough on the whole. By and by, Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life, brought such a strong effect upon him that he began to act at the prince unconsciously. His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the vast admiration and amusement of his intimates. But Tom's influence among these young people began to grow now, day by day, and in time he came to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering, ah, as a superior being. He seemed to know so much, and he could do and say such marvelous things, and with all he was so deep and wise. Tom's remarks and Tom's performances were reported by the boys to their elders, and these also presently began to discuss Tom's canty, and to regard him as the most gifted and extraordinary creature. Full grown people brought their proplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the wit and wisdom of his decisions. In fact, he was become a hero to all who knew him, except his own family. These only saw nothing in him. Privately, after a while, Tom organized a royal court. He was the prince. His special comrades were guards, chamberlands, equeries, lords and ladies and wading, and the royal family. Daily, the mock prince was received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic readings. Daily, the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in the royal council, and daily, his mimic highness issued decrees to his imaginary armies, navies, and vice royalties. After which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat his porcrest, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch himself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandiors in his dreams. And still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh, grew upon him day by day, and week by week, until it last had absorbed all other desires, and became the one passion of his life. One January day, on his usual baking tour, he trampled despondently up and down the region, round about missing lane and little east cheap. Hour after hour, barefooted and cold, looking in at cook shop windows and longing for the dreadful pork pies and other deadly inventions displayed there. For to him, these were dainty's fit for the angels. That is, judging by the smell they were. For it had never been his good luck to own and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain, the atmosphere was murky, it was a melancholy day. At night, Tom reached home so wet, entired, and hungry, that it was not possible for his father and grandmother to observe his foreloin condition, and not be moved. After their fashion, wherefore they gave him a brisk, cuffing at once, and sent him to bed. For a long time, his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting going on in the building, kept him awake. But at last, his thoughts drifted away to far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company of jeweled and gilded prinslings, who live in vast palaces, and had servants salamming before them, or flying to execute their orders. And then, as usual, he dreamed that he was a prinsling himself. All night long, the glories of his royal estate shown upon him. He moved among great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes, drinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of the glittering throng, as it parted to make way for him, with hear a smile, and there a nod of his prinsley head. And when he awoke in the morning, and looked upon the wretchedness about him, his dream had had its usual effect. It had intensified the sordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold, then came bitterness, and heartbreak, and tears.

The narrative to which this note is introductory, was found among the papers of the late professor S. Erasmus Lariby, and as an acquaintance of the gentleman to whom they were bequeathed, I was requested to prepare it for publication. This turned out a very easy task, for the document proved of so extraordinary a character that, if published at all, it should obviously be without change. It appears that the professor did really at one time in his life, have an attack of vertigo, or something of the sword, under circumstances similar to those described by him, and to that extent his narrative may be found on fact. How soon it shares from that foundation, or whether it does it all, the reader must conclude for himself. It appears certain that the professor never related to anyone while living, the stranger features of the experience here narrated, but this might have been merely from fear that his standing as a man of science would be thereby injured. The professor's narrative. At the time of the experience of which I'm about to write, I was professor of astronomy and higher mathematics at Abarcombe College. Most astronomers have a specialty, and mine was the study of the planet Mars, our nearest neighbor, but one in the sun's little family. When no important celestial phenomena in other quarters demanded attention, it was on the ready disk of Mars that my telescope was often as focused. I was never wary of tracing the outlines of its continents and seas, its capes and islands, its basins, strates, its lakes and mountains. With intense interest I watched from week to week of the Marshal Winter of the advance of the Polar Ice cap toward the equator, and its corresponding retreat in the summer, testifying across the Gulf of Space as plainly as written words to the existence on that orb of a climate like our own. A specialty is always in danger of becoming an infatuation, and my interest in Mars at the time of which I write had grown to be more than strictly scientific. The impression of the nearness of this planet, heightened by the wonderful distinctness of its geography as seen through a powerful telescope, appealed strongly to the imagination of the astronomer. On fine evenings I used to spend hours, not so much critically observing as brooding over its radiant surface, to like it almost persuade myself that I saw the breakers dashing on the bold shore of Keplerland, and heard the muffled thunder of avalanches descending the snow-clad mountains of Mitchell. No earthly landscape had the charmed hold my gaze of that far off planet, Guzocean's to the unpracticed eye, seemed but darker and as continents lighter, spots and bands. Astronomers have agreed in declaring that Mars is undoubtedly inhabitable, by beings like ourselves, but as may be supposed, I was not in a mood to be satisfied with considering it merely habitable. I allowed no sort of question that it was inhabited. What manner of beings these inhabitants might be, I found a fascinating speculation. The variety of types appearing in mankind even on this small earth makes it most presumptuous to assume that the deasons of different planets may not be characterized by diversities far profounder. Therein such diversities, coupled with the general resemblance to man, might consist, whether in mere physical differences or in different mental laws, the lack of certain of the great passionate motors of men or the possessions of quite others, were weird themes of never failing attractions for my mind. The elder adult visions with which the virgin mystery of the new world inspired the early Spanish explorers were tame and prosake compared with the speculations which it was perfectly legitimate to indulge when the problem was the conditions of life on another planet. It was the time of the year when Mars is most favorably situated for observation and anxious not to lose an hour of the precious season. I had spent the greater part of several successive nights in the observatory. I believe that I had made some original observation as to the trend of the cost of Kepler land between Lagrange, Penencila and Christy Bay, and it was to this spot that my observations were particularly directed. On the fourth night other work detained me from the observing chair to after midnight. When I had adjusted the instrument and took my first look at Mars, I remember being unable to restrain a cry of admiration. The planet was fairly dazzling. It seemed near and larger than I had ever seen it before, and it's peculiar readiness more striking. In 30 years of observations I recall, in fact, no occasion when the absence of exhalations in our atmosphere is coincided with such cloudlessness in the out of Mars as on that night. I could plainly make out the white masses of vapor at the opposite edges of the lighted disk, which are the midst of its dawn and evening. The snowy mass of Mount Hall over against Kepler lands stood out with wonderful clearness, and I could unmistakably detect the blue tint of the ocean of Delirou, which washes its base. A feet of vision often indeed, accomplished by stargazers, though I had never done it to my complete satisfaction before. I was impressed with the idea that if I ever made an original discovery in regard to Mars, it would be on that evening, and I believed that I should do it. I trembled with mingled exhalation and anxiety, and was obliged to pause to recover myself control. Finally, I placed my eye to the eyepiece, and directed my gaze upon the portion of the planet in which I was especially interested. My attention soon became fixed and absorbed much beyond my want, when observing, and that in itself applied no ordinary degree of abstraction. To all meddling tense and purposes I was on Mars. Every faculty, every susceptibility of sense and intellect, seemed gradually to pass into the eye, and become concentrated in the act of gazing. Every atom of nerve and willpower combined in the strain to see a little, and yet a little, and yet a little, clear, far, deeper. The next thing I knew I was on the bed that stood in a corner of the observing room, half raised on an elbow, and gazing intently at the door. It was broad daylight. Half a dozen men, including several of the professors and a doctor from the village were around me. Some were trying to make me lie down, others were asking me what I wanted, while the doctor was urging me to drink some whiskey. Mechanically repeling their offices, I pointed to the door and ejaculated, President Bixby, coming, giving the impression to the one idea which my days mined at that moment contained. And sure enough, even as I spoke the door opened, and the venerable head of the college, somewhat blown with climbing the steep stairway, stood on the threshold. With a sensation of prodigious relief, I fell back on my pillow. It appeared that I had swoon while in the observing chair the night before, and had been found by the janitor in the morning. My head fallen forward on the telescope, as if still observing, but my body cold, rigid, pulseless, and apparently dead. In a couple of days I was all right again, and should soon have forgotten the episode but for a very interesting conjecture which had suggested itself in connection with it. This was nothing less than that while I lay in that swoon, I was in a conscious state outside and independent of the body, and in that state received impressions and exercised perceptive powers. For this extraordinary theory I had no other evidence than the fact of my knowledge in the moment of awakening that President Bixby was coming up the stairs. But slight as this clue was, it seemed to me unmistakable in its significance. That knowledge was certainly in my mind on the instant of arousing from the swoon. It certainly could have not been there before I fell into the swoon. I must therefore have gained it in the meantime, that is to say, I must have been in a conscious, recipient state while my body was insensible. If such had been the case, I reasoned that it was all together unlikely that the trivial impression was to President Bixby had been the only one which I had received in that state. It was far more probable that it had remained over in my mind, on waking from the swoon. Mainly because it was the latest of a series of impressions received while outside the body. These impressions were of a kind most strange and startling, seeing that they were those of a disembodied soul exercising faculties more spiritual than those of the body, I could not doubt. The desire to know what they had been grew upon me, tell it became a longing which left me no repose. It seemed intolerable that I should have secrets from myself, that my soul should withhold its experiences from my intellect. I would gladly have consented that the acquisitions of half my waking lifetime should be blotted out, if so be in exchange I might be shown the record of what I had seen and known during those hours of which my waking memory showed no trace. Nonetheless for the conviction of its hopelessness, but rather all the more, as the perversity of our human nature will have it, belonging for this forbidden lore grew on me, tell the hunger of Eve in the garden was mine. Constantly brooding over desire that I felt to be vain, tantalized by the possession of a clue which only mocked me, my physical condition became at length affected. My health was disturbed and my rest at night was broken. A habit of walking in my sleep from which I had not suffered since childhood, recurred, and caused me frequent inconvenience. Such had been in general, my condition for some time. When I awoke one morning with the strangely weary sensation by which my body usually betray the secret of the impositions put upon it in sleep, off which otherwise I should often have suspected nothing. And going into the study connected with my chamber, I found a number of freshly written sheets on a desk. A astonished at anyone should have been in my rooms while I slept, I was astounded, on looking more closely to observe that the handwriting was my own. How much more than astounded I was on reading the matter that had been set down, the reader may judge if he shall peruse it. For these written sheets apparently contained the long-for but disparate of record of those hours when I was absent from my body. They were the lost chapter of my life, or rather not lost at all, for it had been no part of my waking life, but a stolen chapter, stolen from that sleep memory on whose mysterious tablets my well-be inscribed tales as much more marvelous than this as this is stranger than most stories. It will be remembered that my last recollection before waking in my bed, on the morning after the swoon, was of contemplating the cost of Kepler land with an unusual concentration of attention, as well as I can judge, and that is no better than anyone else. It is the moment that my bodily power succumbed, and I became unconscious that the narrative which I found on my desk begins. Even had I not come astrate and swift as the beam of light that made my path, a glance about would have told me to what part of the universe I had fared. No earthly landscape could have been more familiar. I stood on the high coast of Kepler land where a transsofford. A brisk, westerly wind was blowing and the waves of the ocean of Delabo were thundering at my feet, while the broad blue waters of Christie Bay stretched away to the southwest. Against the northern horizon, rising out of the ocean like a summer thunderhead, for which I at first mistook it, towered the far distant, snowy summer of Mount Hall. Even had the configuration of land and seabin' less familiar, I shed none the less of known that I stood on the planet whose ruddy hue is at once the admiration and puzzle of astronomers. It's explanation I now recognized in the tent of the atmosphere, a coloring comparable to the haze of Indian summer, except that it's hue was a faint rose instead of purple. Like the Indian summer haze, it was impalpable, and without impeding the view bathed all objects near and far in a glamour not to be described. As the gaze turned upward however, the deep blue of space so far overcame the rosé tent that one might fancy he were still on earth. As I looked about me I saw many men, women and children. They were in no respect to similar so far as I could see, to the men, women, and the children of the earth, save for something almost childlike in the untroubled serenity of their faces, unfurled as they were by any trace of care, a fear or of anxiety. This extraordinary youthfulness of aspect made it difficult indeed, saved by careful scrutiny to distinguish the young from the middle aged, maturity from advanced years. Time seemed to have no tooth on Mars. I was gazing about me, admiring this crimson-lighted world, and these people who appeared to hold happiness by a tenure so much firmer than men's when I heard the words, you are welcome, and turning saw that I had been a costed by a man with the stature and bearing of middle age, though his countenance, like the other faces which I had noted, wonderfully combined the strength of a man's with the serenity of a child. I thanked him and said, you do not seem surprised to see me, though I certainly am to find myself here. A shardly nod he answered. I knew, of course, that I was to meet you today, and not only that, but I may say I'm already in a sense acquainted with you through a mutual friend, professor Edjurly. He was here last month, and I met him at that time. We talked of you and your interest in our planet. I told him I expected you. Edjurly, I exclaimed, it estranged that he has said nothing of this to me. I met him every day, but I was reminded that it was in a dream that Edjurly, like myself, had visited Mars, and on awakening had recalled nothing of his experience, just as I should recall nothing of mine. When will man learn to interrogate the dream soul of the marvels it sees in its wanderings? Then he will no longer need to improve his telescopes to find out the secrets of the universe. Do your people visit the earth in the same manner? I ask my companion. Certainly, he replied, but there we find no one able to recognize us and converse with us as I am conversing with you, although myself in the waking state. You, as Ed, lack the knowledge we possess of the spiritual side of the human nature which we share with you. That knowledge must have enabled you to learn much more of the earth than we know of you, I said. Indeed it has, he replied, from visitors such as you, of whom we entertain a concourse constantly, we have acquired familiarity with your civilization, your history, your manners, and even your literature and languages. Have you not noticed that I am talking with you in English, which is certainly not a tongue indigenous to this planet? Among so many wonders I scarcely observed that, I answered. For ages, pursued my companion, we have been waiting for you to improve your telescopes so as to approximate the power of ours, after which communication between the planets would be easily established. The progress which you make is, however, so slow that we expect to wait ages yet. Indeed, I fear you will have to, I replied. Our opticians already talk of having reached the limits of their art. I do not imagine that I spoke in any spirit of penulence, my companion resumed. The slowness of your progress is not so remarkable to us, as that you make any at all, burdened as you are by a disability so crushing that if we were in your place, I fear we should sit down in utter despair. To what disability do you refer, I asked, you seem to be in like us. And so we are, was the reply, save in one particular, but there the difference is tremendous. Endowed otherwise like us, you are destitute of the faculty of foresight, without which we should think our other faculties well-mive valueless. Forsight are repeated. Certainly you cannot mean that it is given to you to know the future. It is given not only to us, was the answer, but so far as we know, to all other intelligent beings of the universe except yourselves. Our positive knowledge extends only to our system of moons and planets and some of the near-earned systems, and it is conceivable that the remoder parts of the universe may harbor other blind races like your own. But as certainly seems unlikely, that's all strange and lamentable a spectacle should be duplicated. One such illustration of the extraordinary deprivations under which a rational existence may still be possible ought to suffice for the universe. But no one can know the future except by inspiration of God, I said. All our faculties are by inspiration of God, was the reply, but there is surely nothing in foresight to cause it to be so regarded more than any other. Think a moment of the physical analogy of the case. Your eyes are placed in the front of your heads. You a demon and odd mistake if they were placed behind. That would appear to you an arrangement calculated to defeat their purpose. Does it not seem equally rational that the mental vision should range forward as it does with us? Illuminating the path one is to take, rather than backward, as with you, revealing only the course you have already trodden, and therefore have no more concern with. But it is no doubt a merciful provision of Providence that renders you unable to realize the grotesqueness of your predicament as it appears to us. But the future is eternal, I exclaimed, how can a finite mind grasp it? Our foreknowledge implies only human faculties was the reply, it is limited to our individual careers on this planet. Each of us foresees the course in his own life, but not that of other lives, except so far as they are involved with his. The such a power as you describe could be combined with merely human faculties is more than our philosopher's has ever dared to dream, I said. And yet, who shall say after all that it is not in mercy that God has denied it to us? If it is a happiness as it must be, to foresee one's happiness, it must be most depressing to foresee one's sorrows, failures, yes, and even one's death. For if you foresee your lives to the end, you must anticipate the hour and manner of your death, is it not so? Most assuredly, was the reply. Living would be a very precarious business, where we uninformed of its limit. Your ignorance of the time of your death impresses us as one of the saddest features of your condition. And by us, I answered, it is held to be one of the most merciful. 4. Knowledge of your death would not indeed prevent your dying ones, continued my companion, but it would deliver you from the thousand deaths you suffer through uncertainty, whether you can safely count on the passing day. It is not the death you die, but these many deaths you do not die, which shadow your existence. Or blindfolded creatures that you are, cringing at every step in apprehension of the stroke that perhaps is not to fail till old age. Never raising a cup to your lips with the knowledge that you will live to quay fit. Never sure that you will meet again the friend you part with for an hour, from those whose hearts know happiness or faces to banish the chill of an ever-present dread. What idea can you form of the God-like security with which we enjoy our lives and the lives of those we love? You have a saying on Earth, tomorrow belongs to God. But here tomorrow belongs to us, even as today. To you, for some inscrutable purpose, E.C.s fit to dull out life moment by moment, with no assurance that E.C. is not to be the last. To us, he gives a lifetime at once, 50, 60, 70 years, a divine gift indeed. A life such as yours would, I fear, seem of little value to us, for such a life however long, is but a moment long, since that is all you can count on. And yet, I answered, though knowledge of the duration of your lives may give you an enviable feeling of confidence while the end is far off, is that not more than offset by the daily growing weight with which the expectation of the end, as it draws near, must press upon your minds. On the contrary, was the response. Death never an object of fear, as it draws near, becomes more and more a matter of indifference to the more abundant. It is because you live in the past that death is grievous to you. All your knowledge, all your affections, all your interests, are rooted in the past, and on that account, as life lengthens, its strengthens its hold on you, and memory becomes a more precious possession. We, on the contrary, despise the past, and never dwell upon it. Memory with us, far from being the morbid and monstrous growth it is with you, is scarcely more than a rudimentary faculty. We live wholly in the future and the present. What with foretaste and actual taste are experiences, whether pleasant or painful, are exhausted of interest by the time they are passed? The accumulated treasures of memory, which you relinquish, so painfully in death, we count no loss at all. Our minds being fed wholly from the future, we think and feel only as we anticipate. And so, as the dying man's future contracts, there is less and less about which he can occupy his thoughts. His interest in life diminishes as the ideas which its a jazz grow fewer, tell it last death finds him with his mind, a taboo rasa, as with you at birth. In a word, his concern with life is reduced to a vanishing point before he is called on to give it up, in dying he leaves nothing behind. And the after death, I asked, is there no fear, fear of that? Surely was the reply, it is not necessarily for me to say that a fear which effects only the more ignorant on earth is not known at all to us and would be counted blasphemous. Moreover, as I have said, our foresight is limited to our lives on this planet. Any speculation beyond them would be purely conjectural, and our minds are repelled by the slightest aimed of uncertainty. To us the conjectural and the unthinkable may be called almost the same. But even if you do not fear death for itself, I said, you have hearts to break. Is there no pain when the ties of love are sundered? Love and death are not fools on our planet was the reply. There are no tears by the bedside of our dying. The same beneficiant law which makes us so easy for us to give up life for bids us to mourn the friends we leave, or them to mourn us. With you, it is the inner course you have had with friends that is the source of your tenderness for them. With us, it is the anticipation of the inner course we shall enjoy which is the foundation of fondness. As our friends vanish from our future with the approach of their death, the effect on our thoughts and affections is as it would be with you if you forgot them by lapse of time. As our dying friends grow more and more indifferent to us, we by operation of the same law of our nature, become indifferent to them. Till at last we are scarcely more than kindly and sympathetic watchers about the beds of those who regard us equally without clean emotions. So at last God gently unwines instead of breaking the bands that bind our hearts together and makes death as painless to the surviving as to the dying. Relationsmen to produce our happiness are not the means all-sove torturing us as with you. Love means joy and that alone to us instead of blessing our lives for a while only to desolate them later on, compelling us to pay with a distinct and separate paying for every thrill of tenderness, exact in a tear for every smile. There are other partings than those of death, are these two without sorrow for you, I asked. The shortly was the reply. Can you not see that soul it must needs be with beings freed by foresight from the disease of memory. All the sorrow of parting, as of dying, comes with you from the backward vision which precludes you from behold in your happiness till it is passed. Suppose your life destined to be blessed by happy friendship. If you could know it beforehand, it would be a joyous expectation, rightening the intervening years and cheering you as you traverse desolate periods. But no, not till you meet the one who is to be your friend, do you know of him. Nor do you gas even then what he is to be to you that you may embrace him at first sight. Your meeting is cold and indifferent. It is long before fire is fairly gentle between you, and then it is already time for parting. Now indeed, the fire burns well, but henceforth it must consume your heart. Not till they are dead or gone, do you fully realize how dear your friends were, and how sweet was their companionship. But we, we see our friends of far come into meet us, smiling already in our eyes, years before our ways meet. We greet them at first meeting, not coldly, not uncertainly, but with exultant kisses in an ecstasy of joy. They enter it once into the full possession of hearts long warmed and lighted for them. We meet with that delirium of tenderness with which you part. And when to us at last the time of parting comes, it only means that we are to contribute to each other's happiness no longer. We are not doomed like you in parting, to take away with us that delight we brought our friends, leaving the ec of bereavement in his place, so that their last state is worse than their first. Parting here is like meeting with you, calm and unpassioned. The joys of anticipation and possession are the only food of love with us, and therefore love always wears a smiling face. With you he feeds on dead joys, past happiness, which are likewise the sustenance of sorrow. No wonder love and sorrow are so much alike on earth. It is a common saying among us that, we're at nod for the spectacle of the earth, the rest of the world would be unable to appreciate the goodness of God to them, and who can say that this is not the reason the pideous side is set before us. You have told me marvelous things, I said, after I had reflected. It is indeed, but reasonable that such a race as yours should look down with wondering pity on the earth. And yet, before I grant so much, I want to ask you one question. There is known in our world a certain sweet madness, under the influence of which we forget all that is unwanted in our lot, and would not change it for a gods. So far is this sweet madness regarded by men as a compensation, and more than a compensation, for all their miseries that if you know not love as we know it, if this loss be the price you have paid for your divine foresight, we think ourselves more favored of God than you. Confess that love, with its reserves, its surprises, its mysteries, its revelations, is necessarily incompatible with a foresight which ways and measures every experience in advance. Of love surprises we certainly know nothing was the reply. It is believed by our philosophers that the slightest surprise would kill beans of our Constitution like lightning. Though, of course, this is merely theory, for it is only by the study of earthly conditions that we are able to form an idea of what surprises like. Your power to endure the constant buffetines of the unexpected is a matter of supreme amazement to us, nor according to our ideas, is there any difference between what you call pleasant and painful surprises. You see then that we cannot envy you these surprises of love which you find so sweet, for to us they would be fatal. For the rest, there is no form of happiness which foresight is so well calculated to enhance as that of love. Let me explain to you how this befalls. As the growing boy begins to be sensible of the charms of women, he finds himself as I dare say it is with you, prefering some type of face and form to others. He dreams often as a fair hair or maybe of dark, of blue eyes or brown. As the years go on, his fancy, brooding over what seems to it the best and loveliest of every type is constantly adding to this dream face, the shadowy form, traits and linimons, use and contours, tell at last the picture is complete and he becomes aware that on his heart the subtly has been depicted the likeness of the maiden destined for his arms. It may be years before he is to see her, but now begins with him one of the sweetest offices of love, one to you unknown. Youth on Earth is a stormy period of passion, chafing and restraint or rioting in excess, but the very passion whose awakening makes this time so critical with you is here a reforming and educating influence, to whose gentle and potent sway we gladly confide our children. The temptations which lead our young men astray have no hold on a youth of our happy planet. He hordes the treasures of his heart for its coming mistress, of her loan he thinks, and to her all his vows are made. The thought of license would be Teresa up to his sovereign lady, whose right to all the revenues of his being he joyfully owns. To rob her, to abate her her hyper-ogatives, would be to impoverish, to insult himself, for she is to be his, and her honor her lorry are his own. Through all this time that he dreams of her by night and day, the exquisite reward of his devotion is the knowledge that she is aware of him as he of her, and that in the inmost shrine of a maiden heart his image is set up to receive the insense of attenderness that needs not to restrain itself through fear of possible cross or separation. In due time their converging lives come together, the lovers meet, gaze a moment into each other's eyes, then throw themselves each on the others' breast. The maiden has all the charms that ever stirred the blood of an earthly lover, but there is another glamour over her which the eyes of earthly lovers are shut to, the glamour of the future. In the blushing girl her lover sees the fond and faithful wife in the blight maiden the patient, pain consecrated mother, on the virgin's breast he beholds his children. He is prescient, even as his lips take the first fruits of hers, of the future years during which she is to be his companion, his ever-present solace, his chief portion of God's goodness. We have read some of your own man's as described in love as you know it on earth, and I must confess my friend, we find them very dull. I hope he added, as I did not speak at once, that I shall not offend you by saying we find them also objectionable. Your literature possesses in general an interest for us in the picture at presents of the curiosity inverted life which the lack of foresight compel you to lead. It is a study especially prized for the development of the imagination, on account of the difficulty of conceiving conditions so opposed to those of intelligent beings in general. But our women do not read your romances. The notion that a man or woman should, ever conceive the idea of marrying a person other than the one whose husband or wife he or she is destined to be, is profoundly shocking to our habits of thought. No doubt you will say that such instances are rare among you, but if your novels are faithful pictures of your life, they are at least not unknown. That these situations are inevitable under the conditions of earthly life we are well aware, and judge you accordingly, but it is needless that the minds of our maiden should be pained by the knowledge that there anywhere exists a world where such travel steas upon the sacredness of marriage are possible. It is, however, another reason why we discourage the use of your books by our young people, and that is the profound effect of sadness to erase a custom to view all things in the morning glow of the future of a literature written in the past tense and relating exclusively to things that are ended. And how do you write of things that are past except in the past tense I asked? We write of the past when it is still the future, and of course in the future tense was the reply. If our historians were to wait to after the events to describe them, not alone would nobody care to read about things already done, but the histories themselves would probably be an accurate, for memory as I have said, as a very slightly developed faculty with us, and quite too interesting to be trustworthy. Should the Earth ever establish communications with us, you will find our histories of interest, for our planet, being smaller, cooled and was people ages before yours, and her astronomical records contain manood accounts of the Earth from the time it was a fluid mass. Your geologist and biologist may yet find a mind of information here. In the course of our further conversation it came out that, as a consequence of foresight, some of the commonest emotions of human nature are unknown on Mars. They for whom the future has no mystery can, of course, no neither hope nor fear. Moreover, everyone being assured that he shall attain to and what not, there can be no such thing as rival ship or emulation, or any sort of competition in any respect, and therefore all the brewed of heart, burnings and hatreds, engendered on Earth by the strife of man with man, is unknown to the people of Mars, save from the study of our planet. When I asked if there were not, after all, a lack of spontaneity, of sense of freedom. In leading lives fixed in all details beforehand, I was reminded that there was no difference in that respect between the lives of the people of Earth and of Mars, both alike, being according to God's will in every particular. We knew that will only after the event, they before, that was all. For the rest, God moved them through their wills as he did us, so that they had no more dense of compulsion in what they did than we on Earth have in carrying out an anticipated line of action, in cases where our anticipation's chance to be correct. Of the absorbing interest which the study of the plan of their future lives possessed for the people of Mars, my companions spoke eloquently. It was, he said, like the fascination to a mathematician of a most elaborate and exquisite demonstration, a perfect algebraical equation, with a glowing realities of life in place of figures and symbols. When I asked if it never occurred to them to wish their future's different, he replied that such a question could only have been asked by one from Earth. No one could have foresight or clearly believe that God had it, without realizing that the future is as incapable of being changed as the past. And not only this, but to foresee events was to foresee their logical necessity so clearly that to desire them different was as impossible as seriously to wish that two and two make five instead of four. No person could ever thoughtfully wish anything different, for so closely are all things, the small with the great woven together by God that to draw out the smallest thread would unravel creation through all eternity. While we had talked the afternoon had waned, and the sun had sunk below the horizon, the rosate atmosphere of the planet imparting a splendor to the cloud coloring, and a glory to the land and sea scape never paralleled by an earthly sunset. Already the familiar constellations appearing in the sky reminded me how near, after all, I was to the Earth. For with the unassisted eye I could not detect the slightest variation in their position. Nevertheless, there was one holy novel feature in the heavens, for many of the host of asteroids which circle in the zone between Mars and Jupiter, were visibly visible to the naked eye. But the spectacle that chiefly held my gaze was the Earth, swimming law on the verge of the horizon. It's disk twice as large as that of any star or planet as seen from the Earth, flashed with a brilliancey like that of Venus. It is indeed a lovely side, set my companion, although to me always a melancholy one, from the contrast suggested between the radiance of the orb and the benignited condition of its inhabitants. We call it the blind man's world. As he spoke he turned toward a curious structure which stood near us, though I had not before particularly observed it. What is that I asked? It is one of our telescopes he replied, I'm going to let you take a look, if you choose, at your home, and test for yourself the powers of which I have boasted. And having adjusted the instrument to his satisfaction, he showed me where to apply my eye to what answered to the eyepiece. I could not repress an exclamation of amazement, for truly had exaggerated nothing. The little college town which was my home, lace spread out before me, seemingly almost as near as when I looked down upon it from my observatory windows. It was early morning, and the village was waking up. The milkmen were going there rounds, and workmen with their dinner pales were hurring along the streets. The early train was just leaving the railroad station. I could see the puffs from the smoke stack and the jets from the cylinders. It was strange not to hear the hissing of the steam, so near I seemed. There were the college buildings on the hill. The long rolls of windows flashing back the level sunbeams. I could tell the time by the college clock. His struck me that there was an unusual bustle around the buildings, considering the earlyness of the hour. A crowd of men stood about the door of the observatory, and many others were hurring across the campus in that direction. Among them I recognized President Bixby, accompanied by a college janitor. As I gaze, they reached the observatory, and passing through the group about the door, entered the building. The president was evidently going up to my quarters. At this it flashed over me quite suddenly that all this bustle was on my account. I recalled how it was that I came to be on Mars, and in what condition I had left the fairs in the observatory. It was high time I were back there to look after myself. Here abruptly ended the extraordinary document which I found that morning on my desk. That is the authentic record of the conditions of life in another world which it purports to be I do not expect the reader to believe. He will no doubt explain it as another of the curious freaks of some nambulism set down in the books. Probably it was merely that, possibly it was something more. I do not pretend to decide the question. I have told all the facts of the case, and I have no better means of forming an opinion than the reader. Nor do I know, even if I fully believed it the true account it seemed to be, that it would have affected my imagination much more strongly than it has. That story of another world has, in a word, put me out of joint with ours. The readiness with which my mind has adapted itself to the Marshall point of view concerning the earth has been a singular experience. The lack of foresight among the human faculties, a lack I had scarcely thought of before. Now impresses me ever more deeply, as a fact out of harmony with the rest of our nature, be lying its promise, a moral mutilation, a deprivation, arbitrary and unaccountable. The spectacle of a race doomed to walk backward, beholding only what is gone by, assured only of what is past and dead, comes over me from time to time with the sadly fantastical effect which I cannot describe. I dream of a world where love always wears a smile, where the parties are as tireless as our meetings and death is king no more. I have a fancy which I like to cherish, that the people of that happy sphere, fancy thought may be, represent the ideal and normal type of our race, as perhaps it once was, as perhaps it may yet be again.

''Tell It All'': The Story of a Life's Experience in Mormonism,Fanny Stenhouse,460627,5.0,"May 11, 2019",[],0,"ion or to volunteer, please visit Libravox.org. Recording by Danielle Cartwright. Teledall, the story of a life-success-perience in Mormonism by Thanny Stinhouse. This contains a publisher's notice, a preface by Harriet Beecher's dough, and a preface by Thanny Stinhouse. Publishers' notice. By the nearest accident a few months ago in New York City, the publishers became personally acquainted with Mr. TBH Stinhouse of Salt Lake City, the husband of the author of the present volume, and before they separated, preliminary steps were taken for its publication. Almost a year before that time, Mrs. Harriet Beecher's dough, the talented author of Uncle Tom's cabin, had addressed a kind note to Mrs. Stinhouse, congratulating her upon the appeal which she had made on behalf of the women of Utah, in a little work which she had then just published. Some correspondence subsequently ensued between the two ladies who had so successfully attacked the twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery. They afterwards became personally acquainted, and when Mrs. Stinhouse requested Mrs. Sto to write the preface for her new work, that gifted author unhesitatingly replied, I am happy to be able to do the least thing which can show how heartily I sympathize with the effort you are making. May God bless both it and you. It is the prayer of yours, ever truly, H.B. Sto. Preface by Mrs. Harriet Beecher Sto. In these pages a woman, a wife, and mother, speaks the sorrows and depressions of which she has been the witness and the victim. It is because her sorrows and her oppressions are those of thousands who suffering like her cannot or dare not speak for themselves that she thus gives this history to the public. It is no sensational story but a plain, unvarnished tale of truth, stranger and setter than fiction. Our day has seen a glorious breaking of fetters, the slave pens of the south have become a nightmare of the past, the auction block and whipping post have given place to the church and the schoolhouse, and the songs of emancipated millions are heard through our land. Shall we not then hope that the hour is come to loose the bonds of a cruel slavery whose chains have cut into the very hearts of thousands of our sisters? A slavery which debases and degrades womanhood, motherhood, and the family? Let every happy wife and mother who reads these lines, give her sympathy, prayers, and efforts to free her sisters from this degrading bondage. Let all the womanhood of the country stand united for them. There is a power in combined and lightened sentiment and sympathy before whichever form of injustice and cruelty must finally go down. May he who came to break every yoke hasten this deliverance. Harriet Beacher Stowe Author's preface In the fall of the year 1869, a few earnest thinking men, members of the Mormon church and living in Salt Lake City, inaugurated what was regarded at the time as a grand schism. Those who had watched with anxiety the progress of Mormonism, hailed the new movement as the harbinger of the work of disintegrations so long and dissipated by thoughtful minded saints and believed that the opposition to theocracy then began would continue until the extraordinary assumptions of the Mormon priesthood were exploded. And Mormonism itself should lose its political status and find its place only among the singular sects of the day. It was freely predicted that woman in her turn would accept her part in the work of reformation, take up the marriage question among the saints and make an end of polygamy. Little did I imagine that at that period that any such mission as that which I have since realized as mine was in the providence of time awaiting me, or that I should ever have the boldness either with tongue or pen to plead the cause of the women of Utah. But impaled by those unseen influences which shape our destinies, I took my stand with the heretics and as it happened my own was the first woman's name enrolled in their cause. The circumstances which brought a change in my own life produced a corresponding revolution in the life of my husband. In withdrawing from the Mormon Church, we laid ourselves our associations and the laborers of over 20 years upon the altar and took up the burden of life and new. We had sacrificed everything in obedience to the council of Brigham Young and my husband to give a new direction to his mind and also to form some plan for our future life thought it advisable that he should visit New York. He did so and shortly after employed himself in writing a history of the Mormon Church, which has since been published. In the course of time the burden of providing for a large family and the anxiety and care of conducting successfully a business among a people who make it a religious duty to sternly set their faces against those who dissent from their faith, exhausted my physical and mental strength. Considering therefore that change might be beneficial to me and my own personal affairs and to be more patiently calling me to New York City, I followed my husband, Thither. On my way east, I met a highly valued friend of my family who in the course of our journey together over the Pacific Railroad and enthusiastically urged me to tell the story of my life and to give to the world what I knew about polygamy. I had been repeatedly advised to do so by friends at home, but up to that time no plan had been arranged for me carrying out the suggestion. I had hardly arrived in New York before the electric messenger announced that a severe snowstorm was raging on the vast plains between the Rocky Mountains and the Missouri River and for several weeks all traffic over the Union Pacific Railroad was interrupted and I could not return to my home in the distant west. That unlooked force, no blockade, became seriously annoying. For not only was I most anxious to return to my children, but also never having known an idle hour I could not live without something to do. At that moment of unsettled feeling, a lady friend with whom I was visiting suggested again the book and she would not permit me to leave her house until she had extracted from me a promise that it should be written. Next morning I began my task in earnest. I faithfully kept my room and labored unremittingly, and in three weeks the manuscript of my little work on polygamy and Utah was completed. It was issued in pamphlet form and was very kindly welcomed by the press, both secular and religious. And for this I was sincerely grateful. I had not up to that time thought of my chelse, then it's effect upon the people of Utah. But the voluminous notices which that little book received showed the deep interest which the people of United States had taken in the Mormon question. And how ardently they desire to see the extinction of the polygamy institution among the saints. In Salt Lake City, I was so situated that I was daily, I might almost say hourly, brought in contact with the visitors to the modern Zion, for during the summer thousands of travelers pass over the Pacific Railroad. Not a few of these call to see me, and I received from ladies and gentlemen who's kind interested in my welfare I felt very deeply, many personal attentions, many words of sympathy and encouragement, and many intelligent and useful suggestions in respect to my future life. Indeed, I saw myself quite unexpectedly, and I may truthfully say, without my own desire, become an object of interest. By the earnest suggestions of friends and strangers, and by the widely published opinions of the press, I was made to feel that I had but begun my work, that I had but partly drawn aside the veil that covered the worst depression and degradation of woman ever known in a civilized country. Nearly all who spoke to me expressed their surprise that intelligent men and women should be found in communion with the Mormon Church, in which it was so clearly evident that the teachings of Christianity had been supplanted by an attempt to imitate the barbarism of oriental nations in a long past age, and the sweet influences of the religion of Jesus were superseded by the most objectionable practices of the ancient Jews. How persons of education and refinement could ever have embraced a faith that prostrated them at the feet of the Mormon prophet and his successor, Brigham Young, was to the inquiry mind a perfect mystery. The numerous questions which I had to answer, and the explanations which I had to give, showed me that my little book had only wetted the appetite of the intelligent investigator, and that there was a general call for a woman's book on Mormonism, a book that should reveal the inner life of the saints, exhibit the influences which had contributed to draw Christian people away from Christian churches to the standard of the American prophet Joseph Smith, and subject them to the power of that organization which has since his death subjugated the mass of the Mormon people in Utah to the will and wickedness of the priesthood under the leadership of Brother Brigham. There have, from time to time, appeared many works on Mormonism which professed to give an insight into the inner life of the saints. Some of those books were written by women, some by visitors to Utah or persons who had resided for a longer or shorter period in the territory, and more than one at least was published under the name of women who claimed to be members of the Mormon Church. How untrustworthy the accounts of visitors and Gentiles are, and the reason why such should be the case, I shall hear after in the course of this volume, have a occasion to explain. And that the autobiographies of supposed Mormon women were equally unreliable, the following facts will clearly demonstrate. A French lady, a Countess and a woman of the world, Madame Olympé Odwad, came to see me and Salt Lake City. She was a woman of intelligence and quick perception, with whom despondent hour was a perfect pleasure. After her return to France, she of course wrote a book entitled LaFar West. And in that book page, 335, she said, some of my readers may perhaps have forgotten their French lessons, I therefore translate. There are two principal journals in Salt Lake City, the New Desert and the New Telegraph. Mr. Stenhaus is the editor-in-chief of the first. He is a well-tot man of German origin and speaks the French language with greatest purity. His wife, a French lady, is a woman of the world, good looking, charming, well-educated, a good musician, and the mother of 13 fine children. She is an ex-sister of charity and the only French Catholic who has joined the Mormon Church. Now here is an example in type. Let us judge of its truthfulness. In the first place, there it never was such a paper as the New Desert or the New Telegraph. The Desert News has been an existence for some years. My husband assisted on its staff, but he was never editor-in-chief. The daily telegraph was my husband's own paper, but it never appeared under any other name. Little items may seem of small importance, but in a case where truthfulness is called in question, they are worth mentioning. Mr. Stenhaus is a Scotchman by birth and I am an English woman. His acquaintance with the French tongue is, of course, limited, while I, for my part, never was or will be either a Roman Catholic or a sister of charity. 10. And now 13 fine children are all who call me mother. And at the time when Madame Olympé wrote, there were only eight. Here I state the whole case briefly, let the reader judge of the truthfulness of travelers' stories. That comprehensive and truthful works on this subject have appeared are readily admit, but most of them are mere sketches. Such for example as that by Secretary Ferris, a Gentile, but a fair and impartial author. Or else were published as that, for instance by John Hyde, a good man and a vigorous writer. So many years ago that they are now to a great extent out of date. Mrs. Wait is the best Gentile lady writer, but for obvious reasons, although she was a woman of intelligence and penetration, her knowledge of the inner life of Mormonism was necessarily circumscribed. Two books appeared, each claiming to be written by genuine Mormon women. They were, however, originally published 15 or 20 years ago, and although they are still on sale, they are as a matter of course, silent concerning recent events. The first of these two volumes was really written by a gentleman who was himself neither a Mormon, nor had any intimate acquaintance with the system and doctrines of that people. He obtained from the lady the supposed author, all the information which she was capable of imparting, and then worked it up in a startling and sensational manner, mingling facts and fiction, in such a way that the Mormons have always declared that the whole volume was a scandalous libel. The other volume was first published nearly 20 years ago. It was professedly written by the wife of a Mormon elder, but it was really the production of an old lady in New Jersey, who had never even been out to Utah, and who drew entirely upon her own imagination for all that she could not adapt from other sensational writers on Mormonism. This book was first published by a New York firm, and being supposed by the innocent public to be genuine, it had an extraordinary circulation, 40 or 50,000 being sold. The publishers, however, failed, and the stereotype plates passed into other hands. Subsequently, the work having come under the notice of a subscription firm at Hartford, they negotiated for the use of the plates. One word of the heading of each page was cut out, a new title was selected, some old illustrations and a few new ones were added, and an ancient steel plate portrait, which had once done duty in some book of poetry, or illustrated volume of fashionable beauties of years ago, was vamped up, and the supposed signature of the fictitious author was engraved beneath it. This book now recristened and apparently a new volume was launched upon the market. It is at the present moment advertised in many local newspapers, and the confiding public cheerfully by it under the impression that it is the genuine production of a Mormon woman. Such is the history of some of the so-called autobiographies, which have appeared. I mentioned these facts to show that the demand for a true history by a real Mormon woman has never yet been supplied. It is this knowledge which induced me to publish my former little work, and encourages me to hope that the present volume may meet with acceptance. A few months after the publication of my first book, I was invited to lecture upon Polygamy in Utah, and wherever I spoke I observed the same spirit of inquiry, and met with a renewed demand for more of circumstance and narrative, which I had from a sense of personal delicacy, withheld in my former work. I saw no way of satisfying myself and others, then by accepting the rather spiteful invitation of a certain Mormon paper, to tell it all, and this in a narrative of my own personal experience, which I now present to the reader, I have endeavored to do. Myself, not in any sense a literary woman, or making any pretensions as a writer, I hoped you escape severe criticism from the public in the press. I had a simple story to tell, the story of my life, and of the wrongs of women in Utah. Startling and terrible facts have fallen under my observation. These also I have related, but my constant effort has been to tell my story in the plainest, simplest way, and to avoid exaggeration, but never shrink from a straightforward statement effects. I have disguised nothing and paliated nothing, and I feel assured that those who from their actual and intimate acquaintance with Mormonism in Utah, as it really is, are capable of passing a just and impartial judgment upon my story, will pronounce without hesitation that I have told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

The crew to will be lowered for a few moments in the course of the second act. Mind the paint girl act one. The scene is a drawing room, prettyly, but somewhat shortly decorated. The walls are papered with a design representing large clusters of white and purple light. The furniture is covered with a tint of similar pattern, and the curtains carpet in my shade correspond. In the wall facing the spectator are two windows, and midway between the windows, there is the entrance to a conservatory. The conservatory, which is seen beyond, is of the kind that is built out over the portico of a front door, and is plentifully stocked with flowers, and hung with a Valerium and green sunblides. In the right hand wall there is another window, and near the spectator a console table supporting a high mirror. And in the wall on the left opposite the console table, there is a double door opening into the room, the further half of which only is used. In the entrance of the conservatory to the right, there is a low oblong tea table at which are placed three small chairs, and nearby on the left are a grand piano and a music stool. Against the piano there is a setee, and on the extreme left below the door there is an armchair with a little round table beside it. At the right hand window in the wall at the back is another setee, and facing this window and setee, there is a smaller armchair. Not far from the fireplace there is a writing table with a telephone instrument upon it. A chair stands at the writing table, it's back to the window in the wall on the right. And in front of the table opposing the setee by the piano, there is a third setee. On the left of this setee, almost in the middle of the room, is an armchair, and closer to the setee on its right are two more arm chairs. Other articles of furniture, a cabinet, occasional chairs, etc. etc. occupy spaces against the walls. On the piano, on the console table in cabinet, on the setee at the back, on the round table and upon the floor, stand huge baskets of flour and other hands-in-floor devices in various forms. With cards attached to them, a line higgledly piggledly upon the writing table, or a heap of small packages, several little cases containing jewelry, and a litter of paper and string, the packages in the cases of jewelry are also accompanied by cards or letters. A fierce sunlight streams down upon the Valerian, and through the green blinds in the conservatory. Note, throughout right and left are the spectators right and left, not the actors. Lord Farmcom, his gloves in his hand, is seated in the armchair in the middle of the room. He is a simple mannered, immaculately dressed young man in his early twenties, is bearing an appearance suggesting the soldier. He rises expectantly as glad as a flashy power made in a uniform shows in Lionel Roper, a middle-eight individual of the type of the second class city man. Hello, I'm Inlook, just a chap I'm hunting for. Shaking hands with Farmcom. How do you do Lord Farmcom? How are you, Roper? Glad as to Roper, like would like. Rontown is a subgenia here. Tah! Glad as withdraws. Few it's hot. Miss Paradels out. Roper taking off his gloves. She won't be long, I dare say. I've brought her a few flowers. Have you, I've sent her a trifle of jewelry. Farmcom glancing at the writing table. She seems to have received a lot of jewelry. Roper bustle in the cross to the table. By chow, doesn't she? Ah, there's my brooch. I didn't consider I'd arrived offer anything but flowers, on so it's light in acquaintance. Exactly, but I would all friend you know. Dirty in to Farmcom. Perhaps by her next birthday. Farmcom's mine. I hope so. Roper approached you Farmcom and taken him by the lapel of his coat. What I want to say to you is, doing anything tonight? I shall be at the theater. Oh, we shall all be at the theater to shout many happy returns later, I mean. Nothing that I can't get out of. Good, look here. Smight is giving her a bit of supper and the foyer after the show. A dance on the stage to follow about five and twenty people. Will you come? If Miss Dismai is kind enough to ask me. He does ask you through me. He's left all the arrangements to me and more e-cooling. How to never did anything it is like. I, egged him on to this. I've been sweating at it since 11 o'clock this morning. Haven't been near the city, not near it. Well? Farmcom, his eyes going. I shall be delighted. Splendid, been trying to get on to you all day. I've called twice a chalk club and had saved James Place. Sorry, you've had so much trouble. Roper dropped me on to the city in front of the writing table and wiping his brow. Will be the barren, samed a Castro, Bertie, Fulcusen, Stoo, Henning, Jerry, Grimwood, Dwarf Kennedy, Colonel and Mrs. Stidolf. The dolly ends of the glass and our cells besides cooling and Vincent Blant had the pick of the company. Cotany does the food and drink. I don't believe I forgot a single thing. With a change of tone, pointing to the armchair in the middle of the room. Sit down a minute. Farmcom sits in Roper edges nearer to him. Are you going to wait to see Lily this afternoon? I should like to. Because of Jay, should happen to drop in while you're here. Captain Jay? Nickel Jay's or if you knock up against him tonight to the theatre, mum about this. About the supper. Roper, not him. Hmm. We don't want Nickel Jay's. We simply don't want him. And if he heard that you and some of the boys are coming, he might wonder why he isn't included. He strikes me as being rather a surly ill-conditioned person. A regular loafer. He appears to live at Cotany's. I never go there without meeting him. Exactly. Cotany's at a top-back bedroom in German street and hanging about the Pandora that's Nickel Jay's life. He's an old friend of Mrs. Uptchones and his Paradell's two, isn't he? Roper is basically the one. Note him some time. That's it. Really so faithful to her old friends. What are you going with? You're up to complain of that. But I'm a real friend. I've always been a peaked at the musical drama. It's my fad. And I've kept an eye on Lily from the movie she's sprained to prominence. MIND PING TO MINE THE PINGT. Looks after her like a father. Uncle Louge, you call me. We are surely. I'm a married man, you know. Fungong Noms. But the wife has pleaded to occupy her with the kids, and she leaves the drama to me. She prefers bexial. Leeney forward and speaking with great earnestness. Fungong, what a charming creature. Mrs. Rueppe. No, no, Lily. Oh, and so is my Mrs. for that matter, when she chooses. But Lily, up John. Beautiful. Perfectly beautiful. Yes, and as good as she's beautiful, you take it for me. With the wave of the hand. Well, if you see Jay, as you won't. Not a bird. Rueppe rising and walking away to the land. I've warned the others. Returning to Farmingham, who is also risen. By the by, if Lily should mention the supper and the calls to the conversation, remember, she's not in the conspiracy. To shunt Nico, we'll let you think there are to be no outsiders. Why would she very much like Captain Jay's to be asked? I'm a ropper, rather impetitally. Have a day told you, once you're a friend of Lills. Looking towards the door. Is this Ma? Mrs. up John intends. Hello Ma. Mrs. up John. The Paji Lills. Hello Ma. Mrs. up John. A Paji little galley dressed woman of five and fifty, with a stupid, good, human face. Hello Uncle. Lord Shankham. Mrs. up John advancing and checking hands with Farmingham. Glad to see you here again. You have been before, haven't you? Not a week. Of course. You came with Mr. Barry Focusing. But somebody or others always palp in. Pleasantly. Lills is too many I say. It's tiring for her. Won't you set? Lord Shankham's brought Lily some flowers, Ma. To Farmingham. Where are they? Farmingham. Who after waiting for Mrs. up John to settle herself upon the setee, in front of the writing table, sits in the chair at the end of the setee, pointing to a large basket of flowers. On the piano. Mrs. up John barely glancing at the flowers. Our kind of M. Such a waste of money, too. They do go off so quick. Roper reading the cards attached to the various four of gifts. Where is Lily? She sat in to a rising young artist in Fitzroy Street. Clowed Morgan. She won't be on till past five. So tired, in for her. Never heard of Morgan. No, no, anybody else. That's what I tell her. Why waste your time given sentence to a rising young artist when the big man It go down on their ends and knees to do you. But that's Lily all over. She's the best nature girl in the world. And so she gets imposed on her. And so she gets imposed on all round. For and call him gallantly. I prophecy that Mr. Morgan's picture is parodell. Won't have dried before he's quite famous. Mrs. up John, turning a pair of dough eyes, full upon him. How do you mean? Very calm, this can certainly. Er, I mean. Why won't it have dried? I mean, he will have become celebrated before it has dried. His picture's never too dry, you mean? No, no, man. However, it doesn't matter. He isn't even going to put a name to it. Why not? You may well ask. He's been on call when it. The mind the paint girl. What's wrong with that? Everybody will recognize who that is. Mrs. up John and convinced. Er names printed on all of photos. The first time I had the pleasure of seeing a daughter on the stage, Mrs. up John, a man next to me said, Here comes the mind the paint girl. Mrs. up John, turn up. Er, well, perhaps Young Morgan knows his own business best. Let's hope so, at any rate. Roper by the tea table, back in into farm cone. Fun, come. Farm cone to Roper. Er, two Mrs. up John rising. Excuse me. Farm cone joins Roper where upon Mrs. up John goes to the writing table and seating herself there, examines the jewelry delightedly. Roper to farm cone in a whisper. Do me a favor. Certainly. Roper looking at his wife. It's only half past four. Take a turn round the square. I have some business to talk over with the old lady. Farm cone, dotting to Roper, and then coming forward in addressing Mrs. up John. I, er, I think I'll go for a little walk and come back later on if I may. Mrs. up John, contentedly. Oh, just as you like. Farm cone moving towards the door. In about a course of an hour. If we don't see you again, I'll tell little you've been here. Farm cone at the door. Er, but you will. You will see me again. Well, please yourself and you please your dearest friend as little as dad used to say. Thank you. Thank you very much. He disappears closing the door after him. Mrs. up John to Roper looking up. I believe you gave that young man the end to go, Uncle. I did. Told if I wanted to talk to business with you. Business? Resume in her inspection of the trinkets. This is an awesome thing, Mr. Grimmwood Center. Roper, his hands in his trouser pockets. Content playvie misses up John, desperately. Upon my soul, Mar, you're a champion. Now, whatever I've done. Well, you might spread yourself a little over young funkham. Spread myself? Why should I? Lord, funkham. I treat them all alike. So does Lill. He's not the first title we've had here? Not by a dozen. No, but to have it all, I beg your pardon. This is up John, B. Me. So you, well, swear in like a troupe. This chaps and love with her. Oh, they're all in love with her. Or at being one time or another. Yes, but they're not all funkhams and they're not all marrying men. I'm prepared to bet my boots that if little and young funk are won't be thrown together. Sitting under sati in front of the writing table, as Mrs. up John rises and comes forward. Here, do talk it over. Mrs. up John, possibly. Where is the use of talking it over? It's wasting one's breath. Moving to the sati by the piano. My little doesn't want to marry. Anyhow, not get a while. She's happy and contented as she is. Sitting as moving out her skirt. When she does, I suppose it'll be the captain. Robert, between his teeth. The captain. Ma, the day little Mary's nico-chase, you and she'll see the last of me. I don't say that, Uncle. I do say it. The disappointment would be more than I could stand. Selfish, designing beggar. Now, no, lower, piose. A fellow who gets on the soft side of little before she's out of her teens or before she's made any position to speak of and when she has made a position and he's practically on his others sticks to her like a limpet. She sticks to him too. It meant a deal to Lerlan or humble days, recollect. Receive an attention from a jetman in the army. She doesn't forget that. Robert, don't be nervous. Walking about. It's cruel. That's what it is. It's cruel. Here's Gwynie Hawker and Mady Trevelle, both Mary to pierce sons and even shoved to a baronette. All of them Pandora girls, I'm Lill. She's left high and dry and gaged to nobody. It's cruel. She's not actually engaged. Hawhoe. The idea was when he shook onto Indiana and gave up Sulturen so as to be narrow that he should get something to do in London. Then they were to be engaged. Robert is so caustically. Oh, to be just, I admit he's in though hurry. He's been a whole year looking for something to do in London, looking for it at Katanis and at the Pandora bars. He has to be on the spot at night to bring Lillowm after our work. Exactly. And when a decent, eligible young chap comes along and means business, he's choked off by finding nickel jays in possession. Stop me before Mrs. Uppjorn. But I say, What? Farncom has entumbled to it yet. Mrs. Uppjorn in differently. I think they. Bertie Fulcherson's held his tongue about it, so have the other boys who are friends of Farncom's. They see he's hard hit. Oh, they're good boys. They're good loyal boys. There's not one of them who wouldn't throw up his hat if nickel got the chuck. Ma. Mrs. Uppjorn's startled. Hey. This little spree tonight at the theatre. Little things, it's merely among the members of the company. Ain't it? Robbers sitting beside her. You keep quiet now, and know it isn't. Ooh. The boys and Farncom. Mrs. Uppjorn's turned. gracious. They'll be an awful fuss with the cat and tomorrow. Robbers nepping his fingers. Shh. Mrs. Uppjorn rising and walking away to the right. He's so horribly jealous. When Lil Tells him who was at the party, they'll be a frightful kick-up. Robber falling into despondency. Oh, I dare say I'm a fool from my pain's ma. Nothing will come of it. Rising and pacing the room again. Farncom's as shy as a schoolgirl. He'll be on a desert island with a pretty woman for a month without squeezing her hand. Mrs. Uppjorn and an open-tone. Uncle. Hello. Mrs. Uppjorn, fothfully. I shouldn't raise any objection, bearing mind. If Lil could be wained away from the catman took a fancy, to young Farncom. Objection. Mrs. Uppjorn, sitting on the setee in front of the writing table. Oh, said and done. To be Lady F, would no need to work if you're not disposed to, is better than being Mrs. Captain J's and Aventilanger on the stage. Perhaps, till you drop to help keep the part of boiling. Openly in her eyes, widely. Lady F. Robert coming to her. And countess of gold-meing with his father dies. I suppose there'd be any amount of unpleasantness with the family. Robert, this thingfully. The family. There's generally a rumperson such cases. Why, ma. These tip-top families ought to be jolly grateful that we're mixing the breed for them a bit. Look at the two lads who Mary Gweneh Hawker and Lady Favail, Kinterton and Glenroy and Falkess, Sir George Falkess, Eva Shaffdo's husband. They haven't a chin or a forehead between them, and their chest-sourced d'Aro is a ten-inch plague. Quite true. Farncom himself. He's inclined to be weedy. I maintain its grand thing for our English knobs, that there are strips of sons that have taken to Mary Young Young women and are stumps of made-it-ture there in Gweneh Hawker. Orlittle, keen-witted young women full of the joy of life with strong frames, beautiful hair and fine eyes, and healthy pink gums and big white teeth. Snear at the Pandora Girls. Great scottets, my belief at the Pandora Girls, would be the salvation of the aristocracy in this country in the long run. Captain Nicholas G. is lounges in. He is a man of about five and thirty. Already slightly gray-haired, who has gone to seed. Rocher sits in the chair in the middle of the room rather gilthily, and Mrs. Uppjohn puts on a propission-tory grin. G's not into Mrs. Uppjohn and Rocher as he closes the door. Afternoon, Mrs. Uppjohn. How are you, Roper? I can. Hello, Nicholas. G's Advancing. Blilly, not in. No, she's in. It's Roy Street, setting to Morgan. G's from. Why didn't she ask me to go with her? Tenil, I'm sure. She's took me as batch. Huh? Roper. Looking round. Flowers. Eep, so I'm right there. Roper jerking his head towards the writing table. Yes, and some nice presence over here. She's beat-o-requette this year, they last out now. G's goes to the writing table and Roper emisses up, John. Rise and wander away, the former to the conservatory, the letter to the setee by the piano. G's going at the presence. Very nice. The keyed up the case of jewelry. Very nice. Throwing the case down angrily. Confound him, what did devil do they take her for? Roper at the entrance to the conservatory. I'm a remark that one of those gifts is from me, J's. Oh, I'm not alluding to you. But you're blind. G's can be forward and address he misses up, John. I've called in to ask Lily whether she'll come out to supper with me tonight to Katani's to celebrate her birthday. Luigi's decorating a table for me, especially. Mr. and Mrs. Linthornlcom and Jack Weathert. Two Roper. Are you free, Roper? Mrs. up, John sits un-easily on the setee by the piano. And Roper finds some object to interest him near the tea table. I suppose it's no good asking you, Mrs. up, John. No, thank you, Katani. And I'm afraid. A fridge. I'm afraid, little Katman, you're diva. Why not? I'm surprised she didn't mention it to you herself when you brought her own last night. Mention what? The theater? Roper, advancing. Yes, Curtin standing a little spread in the foyer in honor of the occasion. City of the tea table. Quite right, too. She's his best asset and chancet. One was it fixed up? Late last night. The fact is Lily and I had a slight tiff coming home last night. City on the setee in front of the writing table. Huh, I suppose she kept it from me to pay me out. Charply. Who's invited? Erm, only the principal members of the company I understand. Mrs. up, John, moistened her lips with her tongue. Yes, only the members of the company, little says. With more cooling and Vincent blans thrown in. Geez, looking at Roper. You seem to know a lot about it, Roper. I was behind when Morty was going round to the dressing rooms. Geez, two Roper suspiciously. Are you asked? Hey. Are you asked? Roper within the tint, it eriness. Oh, yes, they've dragged me into it. Since when have you been a member of the company? No, but, Dashet, I've done business for Carlton in the city for 20 years or more. That doesn't make you one. I've been old friend of Lills. Not older than I. Violently. Why the place is doesn't Smith invite me. Roper extended his arms. My dear, Nico, I'm not giving the party. Really, you do jump down a man's throat. Sorry, sorry. Lady Beck can thrust in his hands into his pocket. Well, I'll put Jack in the lint ones off. They don't want to sub with me. I shouldn't amuse him. Gazing at the carpet. Her birthday, though. It'll be the first time I shall have been out of that for... How many years? Six years, I. Raising his head, he detects Mrs. up John and Roper. I need each other uncomfortably. Anything, no matter. Siss matter. Geez, taking his hands from his pockets and sitting upright. Any game on? Game? At my expense? I don't know what you're driving at Captain. Geez, harshly. How long's Lily sitting this afternoon? Till five. Geez, look into this watch. What's Morgan's number in Fitzroy Street? Sixty. Geez, Raisy. I'll fetch her. As he makes a movement towards the door, it is thrown open and Lily paired to her, enters with a rush, and in a transcendent vision of youth, grace, and beauty. She is followed by Jimmy Birch, a petite, right-eyed girl, in an extremely chic costume. Lily tearing off her gloves as she enters. Phew, I'm dead. Giving her hand to Jees carelessly. Ah, Nico. To Mrs. Up John. I couldn't stand to heat in the studio any longer, mother. By need Roper beside her, she offers her cheek to him, and he kisses it. Mon Uncle. Jimmy closing the door. That young man Morgan ought to paint the infernal regions. Lily taking her scarf from her shoulder. He might finish with the angels first though. The Jees softly is Roper turns to shake hands with Jimmy. You in a better temper today. Jees and her ear. You drove me wild last night. Lily making a face at him. Surve you right. Passing him. For God's sake, let me lie down. She throws herself upon the setee in front of the writing table, and Jees moves away as Mrs. Up John and Roper go to her. Don't come near me. Give me my fun. Jimmy, where's my fun? Oh, I've left it in its royal street. Beast. Mrs. Up John hurried into the writing table. There's one ear. Among your presence. Lily unpinning her hat. Uncle Lell, what an adorable ring that is you've sent me. Roper taking the fan from Mrs. Up John. Ring a brooch. Somebody sent me a ring. Mrs. Up John sitting in the chair at the end of the setee by the writing table. There's three rings. Of course. One of them's from Nico. To Jees. Did you get my sweet telegram, Nico? Jees who has greeted Jimmy. And is now seated at the chair on the extreme left. So collied. I had your telegram, but it's a pendant I sent you. Jimmy sitting upon the setee by the piano and pulling off her gloves. You shut up, Jimmy. Snatching that fan from Roper. How on earth am I to remember? Finding herself. Who's given me this pretty thing? Mr. Montinavine. Bless him. He's a dear little man. Do he does bite his nails? Glad to suppose with Vincent Blan, who's sent her in after her. See, Lily, glad to see advances to her. Hello, Vincent. Blan, a thin delicate-looking man of 8 and 30, not over-smartly dressed wearing an eyeglass, not into Lily casually. You didn't cut me. Almost on your doorstep. Good Jimmy and James. Hello, Jimmy. Hello, Nicko. Glad to see you and Lily with an elevation of the brows. Oh, are you home? Lily returning Gladys' stare. Apparently, I was so up to mod. Don't, if it's too severe a strain on you. Mrs. Upton to Gladys as the girl moves to the door. Gladys, we'll have tea. Gladys at the door. You can't till it's ready. Lily calmly. Sheek. Gladys retires. Blan, who has rolled across the Lily, indolently. Why do you retain to services that Tosso headed Hussie? Lily, you were a conviction. Oh, she's a little under-to-weather, but she's a perfect servant. Blan, to Mrs. Upton. Ma, you look a bloving. We, shy, could return the compliment, Mr. Blan. Blan, to Roper, who is wearing a waistcoat of rather a print-outs pattern. Congratulations on your waistcoat, Lall. Roper, Johnny, Jimmy, annoyed you. No, no personalities. Lily, giving Blan to her hand. Vincent, yours is one of the loveliest presence I've had today. Emor Simo. How's that for a French accent? Blan, do I be in his eyclass? You can't. Why? You know I've given you nothing. Not even a penny-nose gay. Lily raising herself on her elbow. On my honor, Vincent dear, I swear I thought. The funds are too low. We placed in his eyclass. I did go so far as to price a bangled selfies. But that was before a certain event yesterday. What horses did you back Vincent? I want a fibre, so Jerry Grimwood. Roper to Blan. You are a patient ass. Why don't you leave betting alone? Blan to Roper flaring up. Why don't you lead her city-muck alone? Lily put in her feet to the floor impureously. That's all due. Be quiet, you too. I won't have any rangling in my house. From the way in play, all of you, I want to speak to Vincent for a minute privately. With a gesture. Uncle L. Jimmy, Nico? To Mrs. Uppjohn. Scoot, mother. Oh, yeah. What a talk. Roper Jimmy G's and Mrs. Uppjohn move away and Lily Beckins to Blan. Fenton. Blan close to her with a rife face. Mercy. You've broken your word to me then. Through her teeth. Those damn dorses. Cooling had a tip from the stable. Cooling. Mori-cooling has no children only a fat wife. You've a darling little wife and three kiddies. How much did she drop yesterday? Shant say. Lily rising and touching his arm. Oh, Vincent. She looks round to assure herself that she is unabesirmed. Mrs. Uppjohn and Roper are seated at the tea table with her heads together. Talking. Jimmy is at the piano, fingering out a piece of music. Jesus half hidden in the armchair facing the set tea at the back. Lily tiptoes to the writing table and seats herself there as glad as reappear, showing in the verin-von written by her. One written by her at all fair young man of three and thirty speaking in thick gutherald tones advancing to Lily. Ah, goddess. You have us withdraws. Many happy returns today. Hush.

Going to Mrs. Uppjohn and Roper and shaking hands with him. How are you, my dear ma? How are you, Jimmy? With your hand to Roper and Jesus. My dear Robo. My dear Nicholas. Jimmy to Van Rittemire. Mimicking him. Robo. Nicholas. Why don't they provide you with throat laws and she's at the embassy, Baron? Van Rittemire laughs. Lily has quickly opened the drawer in the writing table and produced a checkbook. After another glance over her shoulder, she sweeps the presence aside in Rites. Then she replaces the checkbook, rises and returns to blend. Again, there's a loud gaffer from Van Rittemire in response to some salio of Jimmy's. Lily to blend, folding the checkkins, slipping it into his hand. Promise. Promise you won't make another bet. Blanned and folding the check. Your check. Put it in your pocket. A blank one? Don't fill it in for more than you can help. I'm not over flush. He deliberately tears the check into four pieces and looking at her steadily, puts them into his waist-good pocket. Blanned as he does so. I'll keep those little, for as long as I keep anything. You fool Vincent. My dear, as if. Such ridiculous pride. Stamping her foot. Lord, what I owe to you. Gladys enters with sand the castle. Gladys is carrying a lace-edge table crop which is assisted by Mrs. Zept-John. She proceeds to lay upon the tea table. Blanned moving away to join the others to the castle. Ah, Sam. The castle is stout course but Junior looking gentleman of 40 of marked Jewish appearance speaking with a list shaking hands with lily. How are you today, Lil? Many happy return th-wanthmore. Thanks, dear old boy. Sitte and other Setti in front of the writing table. Did I send you a wire this morning? Not you, not a thick penoth. I ought to have done so to acknowledge your...what was it? A ring. Diamond and Thafioth. Ah yes, beautiful. It is, rather a knife ring. Lord, you're voice. But...I say... What? Mind you don't go and tell Gap, on any account. Lilie with a greater assumption of ignorance, raising her eyebrows. Gabs? Gabrielle. Mithkato. Why shouldn't I? Namthath, you know very well. Herchitely. You won't. Will you? Lily shrugging her shoulders. I won't. If I remember not you. The castle belonged. Ah now! Don't be stupid. What the good of making myth jiff. Lily shows him the tip of her tongue. Oh, Lil. Let us go out. Lil. One written by her, leaving the group with the back and putting an arm round a castle shoulder. My dear friend, Zam. How are you, Baron? Going to Mrs. Uptown. Afternoon, Ma. Liding to Jimmy and Roper. Afternoon, everybody. Check in hands with G's, who is risen and now joins the group. How are you, Niko?

Van Rittemire in an altered tone after cautious look round. Goddess? A? Van Rittemire and just wait. My drifting little offering. I intrigue you not to mention it to E-nid. Ha-ha-ha. Ah, another of you. Yeah, charming, Miss Mongri. Baron, I wish you boys wouldn't make me presents. And then ask me to keep to Miss Secret from the other girls. And I... I wish it would not necessary. But Goddess, you're also a young lady of the world. You know what women are. Ha-ha. I know what you men are. Maude, a box of young woman with a good, tippered face dressed as a ladies made, inter-swic-ly tying her apron and runs to Lily. Jeez comes to the further side of the writing table and Von Rittemire now joins in there. Jimmy Birch also comes forward accompanied by the castlope. Maude to Lily. Here, give me your things. Lily tosses her hat scarf and gloves to Maude. I wasn't my room having a lie down. Is my hair untidy? I've never seen it anything else. Ha-ha-ha. Maude to Jimmy and the castlope.

Maud returns carrying the pair of silk and slippers. Bond Ritemar who has come to Lily makes a dart at the slippers and takes them from the house. Ah. Permidmi. No, Baron. Slap in his arm. He pushes Maud out of the room. She resists in laughingly and closes the door. Bond Ritemar holding the slippers a lot. Gentlemen, homage to beauty. Valumi, Zam, Vincent, Robert, Nigo, Eddie. The men put themselves behind him in single file in the order in which he calls them with the exception of G's who deliberately sits at the writing table and Farm comb who is embarrassed.

Bon Ritemar waving the slippers in the air and singing. Why was it in our low-valued? They are on shone height, like a gish-delt, right some flows in the window. And the old pearl, the shop from Helsinggoat texts, can dunk in throm-de-nak. Shbe-bun-undik-su-zes-sa. Bon Ritemar holds before Lily and Niels do her. She extends her left foot and he kisses her in step and puts her foot into her slippers. She rewards him by lightly boxing his ears.

Jolly good health, too, Lily. There is a cry of deprivation from Blanned, the Von Rittermeyer, the Castro and ropper. Parncomb fetches himself a cup of tea from the tea table. She's a white woman, Lily is the staunchest tourist pal where she takes a liking. Here, here, here, here. Mrs. Uppjohn, proceed forward through the man and go into Lily. And the best daughter, Breveen. Embracing Lily and then turning to the others. Do you notice the new dress I'm wearing this afternoon? Don't, Mother. Don't. The thinking is a coaster. And the chair on the extreme left proudly. But I'm getting all fin-bated and an act to go with it on sweet. Lily, to Mrs. Uppjohn. A shhh. Well, sipping her tea as if drinking a toast. In a cup of tea. Blanned, the Castro and ropper sipping their tea. In a cup of tea. Von Rittermeyer drinking. In a go-pot tea. Jimmy, two von Rittermeyer, bucklingly. Gobbo-di. Lily waving her hand. Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you, dear boys, from the bottom of my heart. Jimmy to the men. By Jov, she saved me once from going home to achieve lodging and taking a dose of red killer. Von Rittermeyer behind ropper and the Castro, peeping over their shoulders. Ope-ddi. Ope-ddi. Ope-ddi. I'll attend to you, presently, Baron. Lily to Jimmy. I remember. A wretched little shrimp you looked out day. Jimmy to everybody. It was my first morning at the Pandora. They'd had me up from herugate in a hurry to take Granny Harcus place. I've been playing her part in the number two company in the country. And she'd left them in a hole to get married to a stupid old. To foreign com finding him standing there. Sorry. I was to have only one rehearsal. Quentin, her fist. And, uh, didn't they treat me abominably? Miss Anso was late, and we were all hanging about on the stage waiting for her. I've never felt so cold in my life, also lonely. Not a word of welcome, not a nod from a single soul. Simply a blank stare occasionally from a hot e Beauty with a curl lip. And I'd last when I was on the point of howling, I became conscious that somebody was watching me. A tall, pretty thing in a lavender frog. The castrows sitting in the chair in the middle of the room. Lill. I caught her eye, and she came straight over to me and sat down beside me. Shaky, she said, a corpse, I said, and she quietly laid hold of my hand, and held it till dolly Anso couldn't send it to strolling. And when I got up, I asked her who she was, and she told me, Oh my God, I said, I'll never forget your kindness. Well, of course, here the mind to paint girl. Roper de Castro and Van Ritemira singing. Why, why, why, the paint to strolling on the, Blanc seats himself at the piano and thumbs up the air of the refrain of mind the paint. The three men mow thee in the time silently waved their arms, and Lily's head and body move from side to side. Is there anything more ancient than a four year old comics song? Playing a few bars of the melody of the song. Shade of the Nine of the Hand, all the buried cities. Roper Van Ritemira and De Castro to Lily coaxing on. Lily, she got a slil. Lily shaking her head. Oh boys, it's gone. Prasine temples. I couldn't. Blanc plays the introductory symphony and then pauses. Then she sings, he accompanied her. In a mummeter tooth the song comes back to her readily, and she gives it with great wichery and allurement. G starts up and goes to the window in the wall on the right side who looks out. Lily singing. I've a very charming dwelling. You know where without detailing, decorated in the style that's rather quaint, smart and quaint. When you pay my house a visit, you may scrutinize or quizzit, but you mustn't touch the paint. Brand new paint. Mind the paint, mind the paint. No matter what our maple's bills are settled or they aimed. Once you smear it or you scratch it, it's impossible to match it. So take care of the paint of the paint. Rizina coming to the middle of the room, Lily repeats the refrain dancing to it gracefully. Jimmy also rises and she roper Bon Ritimire and a Castro joined in the course in the dance. The three men very extravagantly. Barankoam looks on, in raptured, while Mrs. Uppjohn beats time with her hands. I'm possessed of older graces, though a perfect dream my faces. It may owe to art a trifle or a demand. Hmm, it may end. And I'll cry out for assistance. Should you fail to keep your distance? Goodness gracious, mind the paint, mind the paint. Mind the paint, mind the paint. A girl is not a sinner just because she's not a saint. But my heart shall hold you dearer. You may come a little nearer. If you only mind the paint, mind the paint. The refrain is repeated as before. Mrs. Uppjohn rising and taking a share in it. The invilly drops on the settee before the writing table, laughing and holding up her hands and protest. No more boys. Roper von Ritimire and a Castro gather around her, appalling her and urging her to continue. No, no, no more. I thought such a stiff day. Mrs. Uppjohn was sudden energy to everybody. Out you go, all of you, out you go. Jimmy to the man. Come on, let's miss it. Shaking hands with farm coat. Cool of us to tie our sail. Mrs. Uppjohn tapping von Ritimire on this holder. Now then, Baron. von Ritimire shaking hands with Lily. Omg, goming. Jimmy taking von Ritimire to the door. Welcome. Mrs. Uppjohn pulling Roper away from Lily. Now, one coat. Roper adjusting his coat. Mind the paint, ma'am. Goodbye, Lily. Lily, as she shakes hands with the Castro colleague, Jimmy. Goodbye. Jimmy and von Ritimire disappeared. Now, Mr. De Castro. Moving with Roper towards the door. However, do you think she's going to get through her work tonight? The Castro pause into comb his mustache. Quite right, ma'am. Fautlessly. And a thipper and a damn fast-a-word. Roper turning upon him quickly. Shhh, damn fool. The Castro clapping his hands to his mouth. Oh! The glance at G's who hearing the Castro's remark, has left the window and come forward as Teppertu. Uh, good night, Nicko. Good, goodbye. Goodbye. Blan talking to Lily, neither them having heard the Castro slip. That jingle, an echo of old times A. Lily looking at the time. Yes, but not better times than these times, Finn. Blan sadly holding her hand. Ah, they'll... There are so many tunes in life left for you, my dear. Roper at the door with Mrs. Uppjana de Castro to plan. I'm a long Vincent. Blan joins the group at the doors, Far and Colma approaches Lily. Far and Colma shaking hands with her. Thank you. With verver. Glorious. Lily, reproachfully. Focusing. I mean it. Likely. See you again some day, perhaps? Ah, yes. Roper calling to Farncom. Coming our way, Farncom. Roper planned and the Castro depart. Farncom bows to Lily and makes for the door. Farncom to Jesus. Goodbye, Captain Jace. Jesus who has wandered to the entrance of the conservatory, where he is now standing with his back to the room, have turned him. Goodbye. Farncom shaking hands with Mrs. Uppjana. Delightful. Enjoyed myself amazingly. Mrs. Uppjana wishes you sleep. I'll wear all we slide when a few folks pop in. He rings her hand. If they don't over stay there, welcome. Naturally. Hurriedly. Goodbye. He vanishes. Mrs. Uppjana remedi that the door. Captain. Jesus advancing. All right, just want half a dozen words with Lily, Mrs. Uppjana. Lily to Mrs. Uppjana. Tell him, what? To put out my old green frog mother. I'll be up in a minute or two. Mrs. Uppjana to Jesus. Now you won't keep our long farewell, you? Jesus, grimmly. No, no, I know she won't be in bed till 4 o'clock tomorrow morning at the earliest. Mrs. Uppjana goes out, closing the door, and Jesus comes to Lily. So, Smith is giving you a grand feed tonight at the theater, Lily. Lily arranging the pills on the setee. In the foyer, and a dance set appears. Lily Yarnin, eh. Ugh. Lying upon the setee at full length. Who told you, grumpy? Roper and your mother told me about the supper? You didn't. Ha ha. You were in such a file, mood lost night, coming home. Who will there be to dance with tonight? The men have to come the knee. That doesn't sound very inspiring. Rather, school treaty, isn't it? Nobody from outside? No, it's to be only the men in the theater and principal ladies. Roper's going. Uncle Lill. Oh, well, he's hardly from outside. And to cash, Drow. Sen? I'm sure of it from something I heard him say just now. Sen used to finance Carlton. I suppose they reckon him one of us. G's sitting in the chair in the middle of the room. Smith might have extended the compliment to me, Lill. He knows how I stand towards you. Hopefully, sorry. Oh, he can't help it. G's 20 is fingers together. You see a pho-brand to cash Drow, I asked, there may be others. Lily changed you in her position. Oh, Lell, Lell, Lell. G's with a set jaw. Some of the more juvenile boys, perhaps. Exemining his nails. Lill, watch. When did you make the acquaintance of the young spruccinobility who's been here this afternoon? Lord Furncoom. Bertie brought him and introduced him one day last week. Ha, he's at your feet now. Ha, oh, you may fah. He's on front every blessed night. There he sits, roby, three stalls from the end, prompt side. There are a few good-looking girls at the Pandora, besides your humble servant. Rabesh, his glass follows you all over the stage. I watched him talking to you in this room. Lily, raising herself. Did you indeed? G's beacon his glint hands upon the arms of the chair. God, and heaven, first it's one, then it's another chasing you. Lily, put in your feet to the ground. Oh, you're maddening, Niko. You are. You're maddening. Last night, it was still a henny she chose to be jealous of, simply because you'd hurt him sounding my praises at Katownies. You almost broke to window of the car you went on, so. I confess I object to a henny age, or any man, raving about you at the top of his voice in a public place. Seek's alive, why shouldn't steward rave about me in a public place if he feels like it? I belong to the public. He might rave about a girl who's a jolly-side, less deserving of being raved about, as a girl, and an artist than I am. Well, well, this myth, honeyage. Yes, exit stewardy, and enter somebody else for you to fuss and fume about. This afternoon, it's Lord Farankoom, and tomorrow it'll be a fresh person altogether. One thing to hear you, that I don't know how to take care of myself, and of any poor boy who loses his head over me. Rosy and walk in a way. You're growing worse and worse with your genusy nico, stop it. I'm surprised at you, after all these years. It's beginning to fret me, and that's bad for my spirits and bad for me in business. At the tea table, grabbing the piece of bread and butter and biting at it. And now you're making me spoil my dinner. Relenting. That's not good for me either, you brute. Jesus hands hanging loosely between his knees, sigh heavily. Holy, Lily. Yes, oh, Lily, Lily. Why? Why don't you put me out of my misery? Lily, my dream. Pleasant you, Mary, me. Lily, behind his chin. Mary, you. Taking his hangar to you from his breast pocket, and wiping her fingers apart at sarcastically. Have you come to tell me you've got some work to do with lost? Break it gently, nico. The shock might be too great for me. Oh, I'd find a bell that's soon enough, Lill. I've only had an incentive to hunt for it. Incentive. You had an incentive 12 months ago. When I was willing to engage myself to you absolutely, if you could obtain a good secretary ship or something of the sword. I have no fancy for a beggerly secretary ship. No. All you've ever found see for a seemingly is for living on your unfortunate people. Throwing him his hangar to the living room. Oh, a man of your age can rest satisfied with being a burden to others. Possible, my dull compression. I have been a bit slack, I own. I have been a bit leisurely, but. Lily, inspecting some of the flowers about the room. Nico, that pendant or whatever it is, you've given me. I don't want to hurt you, but I won't accept it. You take it away with you, do you hear? G's not heaving her weakly. No. I'm in earnest. You remove it off my premises. No. She returns to him. Nail, this brother, Robert. Looking up a turd. Bob. She nods inquiringly. Bob's at me to go out to Radisha to a magic group of stock farms he's interested in near L'Awio. Oh, why don't you go? G's forlornly. Roudija, belouio. Looking up at her again with a dismal smile. Come with me. Don't be absurd. G's rising and putting his hands upon her shoulders. No, you wouldn't care a straw. Not a bathed-farthing if I did go. Would you? Lily, sofnine again. Stuff. I should miss you horribly. Toying with a button of his waistcoat. Who'd bring me home from the theater at night, and from her her souls? Who? Ah, who? His grip tightening on her. How? Lily, when's he? Ssss. You'll bruise my skin if you're not careful. G's taking her hand and crumbling it in his. Well, it might be that you'd miss me for a while. The old dog that you're accustomed to find lying on your dormat. Pressing her hand to his lips. But you don't love me, Lille. Not even as much as you did a year ago. You don't love me. Lily, with a fake shrug of her shoulders. Perhaps I don't in a way you mean. Whizfully. Perhaps it snorts in me, really, to live anybody in a marrying way. Me, June, his eyes. Still, as you say, as I say. Lily, person her mouth at him, Winnie Lee. I'm accustomed to you, Niko. He draws her to him. But with a laugh she checks him by offering him her head to kiss. There. Put in the point of her finger playfully on the crown of her head. You may there. As he kisses her. Now I must run upstairs, or mother will lock me. You don't need to take me to her. Won't you allow me to fetch you after the dance? Three or four in the morning? No. I'll give you a rest. Uncle Lille or Sam will take on your job. Go into the door. And don't try to see me tomorrow. Jesus, hurry. Why not? Not till you turn up at night as usual. I shall be a shocking rag all day. Jesus breaking out. Yes, I expect you'll manage to enjoy yourself thoroughly. And dance yourself off your feet, whoever your partners may be. Lily, willfully. Expect I shall. I'll see in her head up. I'll do my best. She departs leaving him standing near the tea table. He takes out his handkerchief and mobs his brow. As he does so, his eyes rest upon the telephone instrument on the writing table, and he stares at it. He hesitates as if struggling to resist an impulse. Then he goes quickly to the instrument and puts the receiver to his ear. Jesus, after a pause. Gerard, 38, 48. Discovering that Lily has left the door wide open, he lays the receiver upon the writing table and goes to the door and shuts it. Then he returns to the writing table and again listens at the receiver. Is that the office of the Pandora Theatre? Suddenly imitating the voice of the Castro. If Mr. Morth cooling in, I may throw the Castro, Then the Castro, gone, 80. Oh, it's that you, Mr. Hickston. Yes, you don't do. About the supper party tonight that Mr. Smith is giving to Mr. Paret del. You're there? I didn't quite understand whether it's to be at the theater or at restaurant. And the theater. Oh, yep. Larged party? No, that is nice. Who are the guests, do you know? Yes? Yes. Oh, and the boys? Oh, someone's the boys are coming, are they? Hey, haven't got the lifts from Mr. Roper yet? Oh, he's been helping to get it up. Are we shall have a splendid time? The boys? Yes. Yes. Thanks. Goodbye. He replaces the receiver as Dan's looking at the door for a moment. Then with his head bent in his hands, this hands clasped behind him, he goes slowly out in the back one.","Plays, Satire",English,04:20:57,LibriVox Volunteers,"['Jewish', 'English', 'French', 'German', 'Valerian']","['Upp John', 'Spurge', 'Farmingham', 'Eva Davis', 'Sonia', 'Paji Lills', 'Zam', 'A.

Four Science Fiction Stories,Alan E. Nourse,561729,20.0,"July 9, 2019",[],0,"t Librevox.org. Recording by Kurt Ziggler, Lake Placid Florida. 4 science stories by Alan E. Norse. The huge transport plane east down through the rainy drizzle and shrouding New York International Airport about five o'clock in the evening. Tom Shandor glanced sourly through the port at the wet landing strip, saw the dim landing lights reflected in the steaming puddles. On an adjacent field he could see the rolls and rolls of jet fighters, wings up in the foggy rain, poised like ridiculous birds in the darkness. With a saw he ripped the sheet of paper from the small, battered portable tie-prider on his laptop, and zipped the machine up in his slicker case. Across the troop hold the soldiers were beginning to stir, yawning, shifting their packs, collecting their gear. Occasionally they stared at Shandor as if he were totally alien to their midst, and he shivered a little as he collected the sheets of paper scattered on the deck around him. Checked the date, 27 September 1982, and rolled them up to fit in the slim round-mailing container. 10 minutes later he was shouldering his way through the crowd of khaki-clad men, scouring up at the sky, his nondescript fedora jammed down over his eyes to keep out the rain, slicker collar pulled up about his ears. At the gangway he stopped before a tired-looking lieutenant and flashed the small fluorescent card in his palm, public information board. The officer nodded weirdly and gave his cold and typewriter a cursory check, then motioned him on. He strode across the wet field scouring at the fog, toward the dimmed-out waiting rooms. He found a mailing shoot and popped the mailing tube down the slot as if he were glad to be read of it. Into the speaker he said, special delivery, P.I.B. business, it goes to press tonight. The female voice from the speaker said something and the red clear signal blinked. Shandor slipped off his hat and shook it, then stopped at a coffee machine and extracted a cup of steaming stuff from the bottom after trying the coin three times. Finally he walked across the room to an empty video booth and sat down into the chair with an exhausted sigh. Flipping a sweatshirt he waited several minutes for an operator to appear. He gave her a number and then said, let's grab a bit please. Official? He showed her the card and settled back his whole body tired. He was a tall man, rather slender, with flat, bland features punctuated only by blonde carrot-shaped eyebrows. His gray eyes were heavy-lit at now. His mouth an expressionist line as he waited, sunk back into his coat with a long-cold-avaded air of lifeless boredom. He watched the screen without interest as it bleeped a timer too. Then shifted into the familiar scrambled image pattern. After a moment he muttered the public information board audio code words and saw the screen even out into the clear image of a large heavy-sat man at a desk. Heart said, chander, stories on its way, I just dropped it from the airport a minute ago with a rush tag on it. He should have it for the morning additions. The big man in the screen blinked and his heavy-face lit up. The story on the rocket project? Chander nodded, the whole scoop I'm going home now. He started his hand for the cut-off switch, wait a minute, heart picked up a pencil and fiddled with it for a moment. He glanced over a shoulder and his voice dropped a little, is the line scrambled? Chander nodded. What's the scoop boy? How's the rocket project coming? Chander grand Riley. Read the report, Daddy. Everything's just duck-y. Of course, it's already for press. You've got the story. Why should I repeat it? Heart scaled impatiently. No, no, I mean the scoop. The real stuff. How's the project going? Not so hot. Chander's face was weary. Material cut-off is holding them up something awful. Among other things. The sabotage has really felt up the West Coast trains and ship months haven't been coming through on schedule. You know they ask for one thing and get the wrong weight or their supplier is out of material or something goes wrong. And there's personnel trouble too, too much direction and too little work. It's beginning to look as if they'll never get going. And now it looks like there's going to be another administration shake-up and you know what that means. Heart nodded thoughtfully. They'd better get hopping, he muttered. The conference in Berlin is on the skids. It could be hours now. He looked up. But you got the story rigged all right? Chander's face flattened into stased. Sure, sure. You know me, heart. Anything to keep the people happy. Everything's running as smooth as Saturn. We're going fine, except a test run in a month and we should be on the moon in half a year. More less maybe. We hope the usual swell. I'll be in to work out the war stories in the morning. Right now I'm for bed. He snapped off the video before heart could interrupt and started for the door. The rain hit him as he stepped out with a wave of cold wet depression. But a cab slid up to the curb before him and he stepped in. Sinking back he tried to relax to get his stomach to stop complaining. But he couldn't fight the failing of almost physical illness sweeping over him. He closed his eyes and sank back, trying to drive the ever-plegging thoughts from his mind, trying to focus on something pleasant. Almost hoping that his long-starve conscience might give a final grasp or two and die altogether. But deep in his mind he knew that his screaming conscious was almost the only thing that held him together. Lies, he thought to himself bitterly. White lies, black lies, woppers, you could take your choice. There should be a flaming neon sign flashing across the sky, telling all people, public information board, fabrication corporation, fabricating of all lies neatly and expeditiously done. He squirmed, feeling the rebellion growing as mind. Prop-aganted they called it, a nice word, such a very handy word, covering a multitude of seething pots. P-I-B was the grand clearinghouse, the last sensor of sensors, and he, Tom Shandar, was the chief fabricator and pervator of lies. He shook his head, trying to get a breath of clean air in the damp cab. Sometimes he wondered where it was leading, where it would finally end up, and what would happen if the people ever really learned, or ever listened to the clever ones who tried to sneak the truth and to print somewhere. But people couldn't be told the truth, they had to be coddled, urged, pushed along. They had to be kept somehow happy, somehow hopeful. They had to be kept whipped up to fever pitch, because the long, long years of war and near war had exhausted them. Where did them be unnatural resiliency? No, they had to be spiked, urged and goded. What would happen if they learned? He sighed. No one as same could do it as well as he. No one could take a story of bitter diplomatic fighting in Berlin and simmer it down to a public, palpable, peaceful, and progressive mating. No one could quite so skillfully reduce the bloody fighting in India to a mild enemy loss, topping American losses 20 to 1. And our boys are fighting staunchly, bravely. No one could write out the lies quite so neatly, so smoothly as Tom Schander. The cab swung into his house and he stepped out, tip the driver, and walked up the walk, eager for the warm dry room. Coffee helped sometimes when he felt this way, but other things helped even more. He didn't even take his coat off before mixing and drowning a stiff fry in ginger, and he was almost forgetting his unhappy conscience by the time the video began blinking. He flipped the receiver switch and sat down grogally, blinked at John Hart's heavy face as it materialized on the screen. Hart's eyes were wide, his voice tied and nervous as he leaned forward. You better get into the office, Pronto. He said his eyes bright. You've really got a story to work on now. Shandar blinked, the war? Hart took a deep breath, worse, he said. David English all is dead. Tom Schander's shoulder disway through the crowd of men in the androom and went into the inner office. Closing the door behind him coolly, he faced the man at the desk and through a thumb over his shoulder. Who's the goons? He growled. You haven't released a story yet. But John Hart's side is Pinky's face drawn. The press, I don't know how they got the word, there hasn't been a word released, but he shrugged and motioned Shandar to have a seat. You know how it goes. Shandar sat down his face blank, eyeing the information chief wouldn't leave. The room was silent for a moment, a tense anticipatory silence. Then Hart said, the rocket story was great Tommy, a real writing job. You've got the touch when it comes to a ticklish news release. Shandar allowed an expression of dis-taste to cross his face. He looked at the chubby man across the desk and felt the dis-taste deep and incrystalized. John Hart's face was round, with little lines going up from the eyes. And almost go task, burlesque comic face that be lied the icy practical nature of the man behind it. Authorally distasteful face, Shandar thought. Finally he said, the story John on Ingersall, let's have it straight out. Hart's rugged his stocky shoulders spreading his hands. Ingersall's dead, he said. That's all there is to it. He's stone-cold dead. But he can't be dead. Lord Shandar, his face flushed. We just can't afford to have him dead. Hart looked up weirdly. Look, I didn't kill him. He went home from the White House this evening, apparently sound enough after long, stiff, nasty conference with the president. Ingersall wanted to go to Berlin and call a showdown at the international conference there, and he had a policy brawl with the president, and the president wouldn't let him go. Sent an undersecretarian stead, and threatened to kick Ingersall out of the cabinet unless he quieted down. Ingersall got home at 430, collapsed at 5, and he was dead before the doctor arrived. Seribral Hambridge pretty straightforward. Ingersall's been killing himself for years, he knew it, and everyone else in Washington knew it. It was bound to happen sooner or later. He was trying to prevent a war, said Shandar Dali, and he was all by himself. Nobody else wanted to stop it. Nobody that mattered at any rate. Only the people didn't want war, and whoever listens to them. Ingersall got the people behind him, so they gave him a couple of Nobel Peace Prizes and made him secretary of state, and then cut his throat every time he tried to do anything. No wonder he's dead. Heart shrugged again, eloquently indifferent. So he was a nice guy. He wanted to prevent a war. As far as I'm concerned, he was a pain in the neck, the way he was forever jumping down information's throat, but he's dead now, he isn't around anymore. His eyes narrowed sharply, the important thing Tommy is that the people don't like it that he's dead. They trusted him. He's been the people's golden boy, their last ditch hope for peace. If they think their last chance is gone with his death, they're going to be mad. They won't like it, and they'll be held a pay. Shandar led a small quith trembling fingers his eyes smoldering. So the people have to be eased out of the picture, he said flatly. They've got to get the story so they won't be so angry. Heart nodded grinning. We've got to have a real story Tommy. Big blown up. What a great guy he was. Defender of the peace. Greatest, most influential man in America has turned out since the half century. You know what they lie up up, the usual garbage, only on a slightly higher plane. They've got to think that he's really saved them. That he's turned over the reins to other hands just as worthy as his. You can give the president a big hand there. They've got to think his work is the basis of our present form policy. Can't you see the implications? It's got to be spread on with a trial, laid on skillfully. Shandar's face flushed deep red and he ground the stub of the smoke out viciously. I'm sick of this stuff heart, he exploded. I'm sick of you. I'm sick of this whole rotten set up. This business of writing rings and rings of lies to just keep things under control. Anger saw was a great man, a really great man, and he was wasted thrown away. He worked to make peace and he got laughed at. He hasn't done a thing because he couldn't. Everything he has tried has been useless, wasted. That's the truth. Why not tell that to the people? Heart stared, get hold of yourself he snapped. You know your job, there's a story to write. The life of David Anger saw. That has to go down smooth. His dark eye shifted to his hands and back sharply to Shandar. A propagandaist has to write it Tommy, an ace propagandaist. You're the only one I know that could do the job. Not me said Shandar flatly standing up. Count me out. I'm through with this as of now. Get yourself some other whipping boy. Anger saw was one man people could trust. And he was one man I could never face. I'm not good enough for him to spit on, and I'm not going to sell him down the river now that he's dead. With a little sigh, John Hart reached into his desk. That's very odd he said softly, because Anger saw left a message for you. Shandar snapped about, eyes wide, message. Each, the chubby man handed him a small envelope. Apparently he wrote that a long time ago, told his daughter to send it to public information board immediately in the vend of his death. Read it. Shandar unfolded the thin paper and blinking unbelievingly. In the event of my death during the next few months, a certain amount of biographical writing will be inevitable. It is my express wish that this writing in whatever form it may take, be done by Mr. Thomas L. Chandler, staff writer of the Federal Public Information Board. I believe that man alone is qualified to handle this assignment. Signed David P. Ingersall, Secretary of State United States of America, for June 1981. Shandar read the message a second time, then folded it carefully and placed it in his pocket, his forehead creased. I suppose you want the story to be big, he said dolly. Hart's eyes gleamed a moment of triumph. As big as you can make it, he said eagerly. Don't spare time or effort, Tommy. You'll be relieved of all assignments until you have it done, if you'll take it. Oh yes, said Chandler softly, I'll take it. He landed the small PIB copter on an air strip in the Oscars of Georgetown, haggled with security officials for a few moments and grabbed an old weatherbeaten cab, giving the address of the Ingersall estate as he settled back in the cushions. A small radio was set inside the door, he snapped it on, fiddled with the dial until he found a PIB news report. And as he listened he felt his hearts sink lower and lower, and the old familiar feeling of dirtiness swept over him, the feeling of being a part of an enormous overpowering scheme of corruption and degradation. The Berlin conference was reaching a common meeting ground, the report said, with Russian, Chinese and American officials making the first real progress in the week of talks. Hope rising for an early armista on the Indian front. Suddenly he hunched forward, blinking in surprise as the announcer continued the broadcast. The Secretary of State David Ingersall was stricken with the slight head cold this evening on the eve of his departure for the Berlin conference, and was advised to postpone the trip temporarily. John Harris Darby first under secretary was dispatched in his place. Mr. Ingersall expressed confidence that Mr. Darby would be able to handle the talks as well as himself, in view of the optimistic trend in Berlin last night. Shandar snapped the radio off viciously, a roar of disgust rising in his throat, cut off just in time. Lies, lies, lies, lies. Some people knew they were lies. What could they really think? People like David Ingersall's wife. Carefully he rained in his thoughts, channeled them. He had called the Ingersall home the night before, announcing his arrival this morning. The taxi ground up the gravel driveway, stopped before an army Jeep at the Iron Grilled Gateway. A security officer flipped a cigarette into the ground, taking his head. Can't go in, Secretary's orders. Shandar stepped from the cab, briefcase under his arm. He showed his card, scowled when the officer continued shaking his head. Orders say nobody. Look, blockhead, shandar graded. If you want to hang up by your toes, I can put through a special check line to Washington to confirm my appointment here. I'll also recommend you for the salt mines. The officer groulled, wise guy, and shuffled into the guard's shack. Minus later he appeared again, jerked his thumb toward the estate. Take off, he said, see that you check here at the gate before you leave. He was admitted to the huge house by a stone-faced butler, who led him through a maze of corridors into a huge dining room. Morning sunlight gleamed through the glassed-in wall, and shandar stopped at the door, almost speechless. He knew he'd seen the girl somewhere. At one of the Washington parties, or in the newspapers, her face was unmistakable. It was the sort of face that a man never forgets once he glimpses it. Then, puckish, with wide-set gray eyes that seemed both somber and secretly amused. A full, sensitive mouth, and blonde hair exceedingly fine, crop close about the ears. She was eating her breakfast, a rolled-up newspaper beside her plate, and as she looked up, her eyes were not warm. She just stared at shandar angrily for a moment, then sat down her coffee cup and threw the paper to the floor with a slam. Your shandar I suppose. Shandar looked at the paper, then back at her. Yes, I'm Tom Shandar, but you're not Mrs. Ingersall. A profound observation, mother isn't interested in seeing anyone this morning, particularly you. She motioned to a chair. You can talk to me if you want to. Shandar sat down in the profored seat, struggling to readjust his thinking. Well, he said, finally, I wasn't expecting you. He broke into a grin, but I should think you could help. You know what I'm trying to do, I mean about your father. I want to write a story, and the logical place to start would be with his family. The girl blinked white eyes innocently. Why don't you start with the newspaper files? She asked her voice silky. You'd find all sorts of information about daddy there. Pages and pages. No, no, I don't want that kind of information. Your is daughter, Miss Ingersall. You could tell me about him as a man. Something about his personal life. What sort of man he was? She shrugged indifferently, but her to piece of toast, as Shandar felt most acutely the pangs of his own mist breakfast. He got up at seven every morning, she said. He brushed his teeth and ate breakfast. At nine o'clock the state department called for him. Shandar shook his head unhappy. No, no, that's not what I mean. Then perhaps you'd tell me precisely what you do mean. Her voice was clipped and hard. Shandar sighed in exasperation. The personal angle, his likes and dislikes, how he came to formulate his views, his relationship with his wife with you. He was a kind and loving father, she said, her voice mocking. He loved to read, he loved music. Oh yes, put that down. He was a great lover of music. His wife was the apple of his eye, and he tried for all the duties of his position to provide us with a happy home life. Miss Ingersol, she stopped in mid-sinnance, her gray eyes veiled and sugarhead slightly. That's not what you want to hear either. Shandar stood up and walked to a window, looking out over the wide veranda. Carefully he snobbed his cigarette in a nash tray, then turned sharply to the girl. Look, if you want to play games I can play games too. Either you're going to help me or you're not, it's up to you. But you forget one thing, I'm a propagandaist. I mind say I'm an expert propagandaist. I can tell a true story from a false one. You won't get anywhere lying to me or evading me, and if you choose to try, we can call it off right now. You know exactly the type of information I need from you. Your father was a great man, and he rates the fair shake in the right-ups. I'm asking you to help me. Her lips formed a snare, and you're going to give him a fair shake. I'm supposed to believe. She pointed to the newspaper, with garbage like that, head cold? Her face flushed and she turned her back angrily. I know your riding, Mr. Shandar. I've been exposed to it for years. You've never written an honest true story in your life, but you always want the truth to start with. Don't you? I'm going to give you the truth and let you do what you want with it. Is that the idea? No dice, Mr. Shandar, and you even have the goal to brag about it. Shandar flushed angrily. You're not being fair. The story is going to press straight and true, every word of it. This is one story that won't be altered. And then she was laughing, choking, holding her sides as the tears streamed on her cheeks. Shandar watched her, red name, anger growing up to choke him. I'm not joking, he snapped. I'm breaking with the routine. Do you understand? I'm through with a lies now. I'm riding this one straight. She wiped her eyes and looked at him, bitter lines under her smile. You couldn't do it, she said, still laughing. You're a fool to think so. You could ride it and you'd be out of a job so fast you wouldn't even know what hit you. But you'd never get it into print, and you know it, you'd never even get the story to the inside offices. Shandar stared at her. That's what you think. He said slowly. This story will get to the press if it kills me. The girl looked up at him, eyes wide and credulous. You mean that don't you? I never meant anything more in my life. She looked at him wonderfully, motioned him to the table, a far away look in her eyes. Have some coffee, she said, and then turned to him, her eyes wide with excitement. The snare was gone from her face, the coldness and hostility, and her eyes were pleading. If there were some way to do it, if you really meant what you said, if you'd really do it, give people a true story. Shandar's voice was low. I told you I'm sick of this mill. There is something wrong with this country, something wrong with the world. There's a rottenness in it, and your father was fighting to cut out the rottenness. This story is going to be straight, and it's going to be printed if I get shot for treason, and it could split things wide open at the seams. She sat down at the table, her lower lip trembled, and her voice was tense with excitement. Let's get out of here, she said, let's go someplace where we can talk. They found a quiet place off the business section in Washington, one of the newer places with the small enclosed booths, catering to people wary of ease dropping and overheard conversations. Shandar ordered beers, then let a small can lean back facing and anger-sol. It occurred to him that she was exceptionally lovely, but he was almost frightened by the look on her face, the suppressed excitement, the cold bitter lines about her mouth. Anchor grew asleep the thought crossed his mind that he'd hate to have this woman against him. She looked as though she would be capable of more than a care-to-tangle with. For all her lovely face there was an edge of thin eyes to her smile, a razor-sharp dangerous quality that made him curiously uncomfortable. But now she was nervous, with dry and a cigarette from his pack with trembling fingers, fondling with his lighter and telly struck a match for her. Now, he said, why the secrecy? She glanced at the closed door to the booth. Mother would kill me if she knew I was helping you. She hates you, and she hates the public information board. I think that hated you too. Shandar took the folded letter from his pocket. Then what do you think of this? He asks softly, doesn't this strike you a little odd? She read English-solce letter carefully, then looked up at Tom, her eyes wide with surprise. So this is what that note was, this doesn't wash Tom. You're telling me it doesn't wash, nice wording. I believe that Manalone is qualified to handle this assignment. Why me? And of all things, why me alone? They knew my job, and he fought me and the PIB every step of his career. Why a note like this? She looked up at him. Do you have any idea? Sure, I've got an idea. A crazy one, but an idea. I don't think he wanted me because of the writing. I think he wanted me because I'm a prop-agandist. She scowled, it still doesn't wash. There are lots of prop-agandists, and why would he want a prop-agandist? Shanders eyes narrowed. Let's let it ride for a moment. How about his files? In his office in the State Department. He didn't keep anything personal at home? Her eyes grew wide. All know he wouldn't have dared, not the sort of work he was doing. With his files locked under key and the key in the State Department nothing could be touched without his knowledge, but at home anybody might have walked in. Of course, how about enemies? Did he have any particular enemies? She left humorously. Name anybody in the current administration. I think he had more enemies than anybody else in the cabinet. Her mouth turned down bitterly. He was a stumbling block. He got in people's way, and they hated him for it. They killed him for it. Shanders eyes widened. You mean you think he was murdered? All know nothing's so crude. They didn't have to be crude. They just let him but his head against a stone wall. Everything he tried was blocked or else it didn't lead anywhere. Like this Berlin conference, it was a powder keg. Dad gammled everything on going there, forcing the delegates to face facts, to really put their cards on the table. Ever since the United Nations fell apart in 72, Dad had been trying to get America and Russia to sit at the same table. But the president cut him out at the last minute. It was planned that way to let him get up to the very brink of it, then slap him down hard. They did it all along. This was just the last he could take. Shandra was silent from moment. Any particular thorns in his side? And shrugged. Munitions people mostly. Dardmouth Barring had a pressure lobby that was trying to throw him out of the cabinet. The president sided with them, but he didn't dare do it for the fair people would squawk. He was planning to blame the failure of the Berlin conference on Dad and get him out at that way. Shandra stared, but what if that conference fails were in full-scale war? Of course, that's the whole point. She scalded her glass blinking back tears. Dad could have stopped it, but they wouldn't let him. It killed him, Tom. Shandra watched the smoke curling up from his cigarette. Look, he said, I've got an idea, and it's going to take some fast work. That conference could blow up any minute, and then I think we're going to be in real trouble. I want you to go to your father's office and get the contents of his personal file. Not the business files, his personal files. Put them in a brief case and subway express them to your home. If you have any trouble, have them check with PIV. We have full authority. And I'm at right now. I'll call them and give them the word. Then meet me here again, with the files at 7.30 this evening. She looked up, her eyes wide. What are you going to do? Shandra snobbed out as smoke, his eyes bright. I've got an idea that we may be onto something, just something I want to check. But I think if we work at right, we can lay these boys that fought your father out by the toes.

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (version 5),Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,349874,12.0,"April 16, 2019",[],0,"se visit Libravox.org. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle A scandal in Bohemia Part 1 To Sherlock Holmes, she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes, she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen. But as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, saved with a jiebe in a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer, excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finally adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, oblivious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centered interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention. While Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition. The drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation, in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time, I heard some vague account of his doings, of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trep off murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincome Lee. And finally, of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the Daily Press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. One night, it was on the 20th of March 1888. I was returning from a journey to a patient, for I had now returned to civil practice. When my way led me through Baker Street, as I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see homes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure past twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasp behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive, it seldom was, but he was glad I think to see me. With hardly a words spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, through a cross-is-case of cigars, and indicated a spirit-case and a gas-gean in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. Wedlock suits you, he remarked. I think Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you. Seven, I answered. Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more I fancy Watson. And in practice again, I observed, you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness. Then how did you know? I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl? My dear Holmes said I, this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess. But as I have changed my clothes, I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice. But there again, I failed to see how you work it out. He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together. It is simplicity itself, so he. My eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously, they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence you see, my double deduction that you had been out in file weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot splitting specimen of the London slatey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my room, smelling a biotiform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bold on the right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his step-as-goop, I must be dull and deed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession. I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. When I hear you give your reasons, I remarked. The thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process, and yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours. Quite so, he answered, letting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair. You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room. Frequently. How often? Well, some hundreds of times. Then how many are they? How many? I don't know. Quite so. You have not observed, and yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are 17 steps because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this. He threw over a sheet of thick, pink tinted note paper, which had been lying open upon the table. It came by the last post, said he. Read it aloud. The note was undated, and without either signature or address. There will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight o'clock, it said. A gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters, which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Being your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it a miss if you are visitor where a mask. This is indeed a mystery, I remarked. What do you imagine that it means? I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Incensibly, when begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself, what do you deduce from it? I carefully examine the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. The man who wrote it was presumably well-to-do, I remarked, endeavoring to imitate my companions' process. Such paper could not be bought under half a crown of packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff, peculiar that is the very word said homes. It is not an English paper at all, hold it up to the light. I did so and saw large E with a small G, A P and a large G with a small T woven into the texture of the paper. What do you make of that? Astholms. The name of the maker no doubt, or his monogram, rather. Not at all. The G with a small T stands for a gazelle shaft, which is the German 4 company. It is a customary contraction like our co. P, of course, stands for a papier. Now for the E G, let us glance at our continental gazetteer. He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. Egglove, egglonits, here we are, Egria. It is an adjournment speaking country. In Bohemia, not far from cosbad. Markable as being the scene of the death of valenstein, and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills, ha ha my boy, what do you make of that? His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant clown from his cigarette. The paper was made in Bohemia, I said, precisely, and the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you know the peculiar construction of the sentence? This account of you we have from all quarters received. A Frenchman or Russian could not have written it. It is the German who is so encurtious to his verbs. It only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this German who writes on Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to show his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts. As he spoke, there was the sharp sound of horses hooves and greying wheels against the curve, followed by a sharp pole at the bell. A pair by the sound said he, yes, he continued glancing out the window. A nice little broom and a pair of beauties, 150 guinea pigs of peace. There's money in this case Watson if there is nothing else. And I think that I had better go homes. Not a bit, Doctor, stay where you are. I am lost without my boss well, and this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it. But you are client, never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down to that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention. A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. There was a loud and authoritative tap. Come in, set homes. A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet, six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of aster couldn, was four-scro升 in front of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak that was thrown over as shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and secured the neck with a broach which consisted of a single flaming barrel. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which returned at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence, which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad brim tat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones, a black visored mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. You had my note, he asked for the deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. I told you that I would call. He looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address. Pray, take a seat, said Holmes. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Who have I the honor to address? You may address me as the count upon crum, a bohemian novelman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a men of honor and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone. I rose to Ghewell, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. It is both or none, said he. You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me. The count shrugged his broad shoulders. Zen, I must begin, said he. By binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years. At the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. At present, it is not too much to say, said it is of such weight, it may have an influence upon European history. I promise, said Holmes. And I, you will excuse this mask, continue to our strange visitor. The August person whom employs me, wishes his agent to be unknown to you. And I may confess, at once, that's the title by which I have just called myself, is not exactly my own. I was aware of it, said Holmes, quietly. The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what my grow to be in a men's scandal and seriously compromise one of the running families of Europe. To speak plainly, Zometre implicates the great house of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia. I was also aware of that, murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor glance was some apparent surprise at the length with lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. If your majesty would count a sentence to state your case, he remarked. I should be better able to advise you. The man's spring from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. You all right, he cried, I am Zaking, why should I attempt to conceal it? Why indeed, murmured Holmes, your majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottstrike, Sigismann von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Castle Felsstein, and hereditary king of Bohemia. But you can understand, said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead. You can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet, Zometre was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you. Then, pray, consult, said Holmes, shedding his eyes once more. The facts are briefly zeds. Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventurous, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you. Kindly look her up in my index doctor. Remembered Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years, he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case, I found her biography sandwiched between that of a Hebrew rabbi, and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fishes. Let me see, said Holmes. Hmm, bored in New Jersey in the year 1858, control to, hmm, let's scala. Hmm, Primate Donna Imperial, opera of Warsaw. Yes, retired from operatic stage. Ha, living in London quite so, your majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desires of getting those letters back. Precisely so, but how? Was there a secret marriage? None. No legal papers or certificates. None. Then I failed to follow your majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing your other purposes, how she to prove their authenticity. There is a writing. Poo, poo, forgery. My private note paper, stolen, my own seal, imitated. My photograph? But, we were both in the photograph. Oh dear, that is very bad. Your majesty hasn't deed committed an indiscretion. I was mad, insane. You have compromised yourself seriously. I was only crown prince then. I was young. I am but 13 now. It must be recovered. We had tried and failed. Your majesty must pay. It must be bought. She will not sell. Still, and then? Five attempts had been made. Twice, burglar's in my pay, ran sacked her house. Once we diverged her luggage when she traveled. Twice, she has been wailed. There has been no result. No sign of it. Absolutely none. Holmes laughed. It is quite a pretty little problem, said he. But a very serious one to me, returned the king reproachfully. Very indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph? To ruin me. But how? I am about to be married. So I have heard. To clotel the luftman von Sexman Engine. Second doctor of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end. And I reenadler. Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know this she will do it. You do not know her. But she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women. And the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no links to which she would not go. None. You are sure that she has not sent it yet. I am sure. And why? Because she has said that she would send it on the day when Zabatrodo was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday. Oh, then we have three days yet. Set homes for the young. That is very fortunate. As I have one or two matters of importance to look into just a present, your majesty will of course stay in London for the present. Certainly, you will find me at the longum under the name of Zakal Devon Krum. Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress. I'm pretty do so. I shall be all anxiety. Then as to money. You have cart blanche. Absolutely. I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have Zatvotra graph. And for present expenses. The king took a heavy sham wall that the bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table. Zatat 300 pounds in gold and 700 in notes. He said. Home scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and headed it to him. And mad Mazzel's address. He asked. His brianny lodge, the serpentine avenue, St. John's wood. Home took an out of it. One other question said he. Was the photographic cabinet? It was. Then good night, your majesty. And I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good night Watson. He added, as the wheels of the royal broom rolled down the street. If you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock. I should like to chat this little matter over with you. And of a scandal in Bohemia.

Venus is a man's world. Story was first published in Galaxy Science, Fiction July 1951. Venus is a man's world by William Ten. I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me and a girl besides, she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship jam packed with 300 females just aching to get themselves husbands, the one place they're still to be had to the planet Venus and you know I'll be in trouble. Bad trouble with a law which is the worst of all I can get into. Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara space ward, I riggled out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin. Now you be careful for an n. Sis called after me as she opened a book called Family Problems of the Front Dear Woman. Remember you're a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you. I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ships crews are men. Women are too busy with important things like government to run ships. I felt free all over and happy. Now was my chance to really see the Eleanor Roosevelt. It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. I had and behind me all the way up to where the companionway curved in out of sight. There was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white doors. On and on and on, gee, I thought excitedly this is one big ship. Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of stars in the void, set in the wall, but they were only pictures. Nothing that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in the boy, rocketeers, no port holes, no vis-a-plates, nothing. That's how when I came to the crossway I stopped for a second, then turned left. To the right sea there was deck four, then deck three, leading inward past the engine, focussul to the main jets and the graph helix going per per per per per in the comforting way big machine rehats with his happy and arld. But to the left, the crossway led all the way to the outside level, which ran just under the hull. There were port holes in the hull. I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we lifted on the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like the dining salon and the library and lifeboat 68, where we should go in case of emergency. I looked for the important things. As I tried at the long-the-crossway I sort of wish that Sis hadn't decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship now, I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity underfoot all the time, just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. But women always know what's right and a boy can only make faces and do what they say, same as the men have to. Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the wall and see the sliding panels that would come charging out and block the crossways into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits standing in them, like those nights they used to have back in the middle ages. In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of companion way, they had the words etched into the door, break glass with hammered upon wall, remove a spacesuit bend, proceed to dawn it in the following fashion. I read the following fashion until I knew it by heart. Boy, I said to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I sure like to get into one of those, but it would be more fun than those diving suits back in undersea. And all the time I was alone, that was the best part. Then I passed deck 12 and there was a big sign. Notice passengers not permitted past this point, a big sign in red. I peaked around the corner, I knew it, the next deck was the hull. I could see the port holes. Every 12 feet they were, filled with a velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed existed in the universe. There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. Even this distance from the grave he looks, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely, if I just took one quick look. But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently. Then, I saw the big red sign again. Passengers not permitted. Well, didn't I know from my severks class that only women could be earth citizens these days? Sure ever since the male, de-sufferage act. And didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the careful patient way she always talks politics and things like that to me. Technically, for none, I'm the only passenger in our family. You can't be one because not being a citizen, you can't acquire an earth passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this clause. This evidence sparling and all dependent male members of family. This number not to exceed the registered quota of subregulations pertaining and so on. I want you to understand these matters so that you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs. No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men. And of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb things. I'm old enough. I guess to know that it isn't what women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting married. If it were a Sis in 300 other pretty girls like her, wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands. Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do with me. I know it's just would say to that, but at least it wasn't argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law. I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to the left about five times, his biggest I'd ever seen it, except in the movies was the moon. A great blob of grey and white puck marks holding off the black of space. I was hoping to see the earth, but I figured it must be on the other side of the ship more behind us. I pressed my nose against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceship taking off Marsbound. I wish I was on that one. Then I noticed a little farther down the companion way a stretch of blank wall where there should have been port holes. High up on the wall and glowing red letters were the words, lifeboat 47, passengers 32, crew 11, unauthorized personnel keep away. Another one of those signs. I crept up to the port-hold nearest, it could just barely make out the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I knew must be the door, but I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open it with. Not even a button you could press. That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer capes back home in under sea. But knock our voice. I tried the two knock combinations I knew and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice key, might as well see if that's yet I figured. 23, open sesame, for a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million possible combinations. The door clicked inward toward a black hole and a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine. I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Here I got my breath and set up, the door had been shut again, when the light came on I found myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the coal blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen. He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that looked hard and soft at the same time. His boots were made of it too and so was the hood hanging down his back. And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the deep dark burned all the way in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation. The kind of tan that comes from day after broadly day under a really hot sun. His hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long combed out waves with the yellowish tinge that borrowed all the way down to his shoulders. I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books. Every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable soup bowl style. I was staring at his hair almost forgetting about the blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have it all, when I suddenly got scared right through. His eyes. They didn't blink and they seemed to be no expression around them. Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a surface zoo that had stare quietly at me for 20 minutes until it opened too long to study jaws. I changed shatters, he said suddenly only a tadpole I must be getting jumpy enough to splash. Then he shoved the blaster away in a hole through a mate of the same squeally leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted to my feet feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes. I held out my hand the way sister taught me. My name is Frutonand Sparling, I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Hope for your sake. He said to me, that you are at what you seem, tadpole brother to one of them husbandless a Nora. What? A Nora is a female looking to nest. A Nora is a herd of the same, come from flatbow ways. Flatbow, whether Venusian natives are they? Are you a Venusian or part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope? He chuckled and swung me into one of the bunks that lined the lifeboat. Breastions you ask, he said in a soft voice. Venus is a sharp enough place for a dry horn, let alone a tadpole dry horn with a boss minded sister. I'm not a dry leg, I told him probably, we're from undersea. Why horn, I said, not dry leg, and what's undersea? Well, in undersea we call foreigners and newcomers dry legs, just like on Venus, I guess you call them dry horns. And then I told him how undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico when the mineral resources of a land began to give out, and engineers figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms. He nodded, he'd heard about the sea bottom mining cities that were bubbling under protective domes and every one of the earth's oceans, just about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets. He looked impressed when I told him about mom and pop being one of the first couples to get married in undersea. He looked thoughtful when I told him how cis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked disgusted when I told him how mom and undersea representative on the world council had been one of the frameries of the male B suffrage act after the third atomic war had resulted in the maternal revolution. He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time mom and pop were blown up in a surfacing boat. Well, after the funeral there was a little money so sister sided we might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on earth. She figured you know the three out of four. How's that? The three out of four no more than three women out of every four on earth can expect to find husbands not enough men to go around way back in the 20th century it began to be felt cis says what with the wars and all then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die or get no good from the radio activity. Then the best man went to the planet says until by now even if a woman can scrim j a personal husband he's not much to boast about the stranger not it violently not on earthy isn't those busy body a noron make sure of that. What a place suffering grittin ex I had a belly full. He told me about it women were scarce on Venus and he hadn't been able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little islands he had decided to go to earth where there was supposed to be a surplus naturally having been born and brought up on a very primitive planet he didn't know it's a woman's world like the older boys in school used to say the moment he landed on earth he was in trouble he didn't know he had to register at a government operated hotel for transient males he threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something nasty about the lithofus hair and imagine he not only resisted arrest resulting in three hospitalized policemen but he sassed the judge in open court told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female attorneys told her that where I come from a man spoke his piece when he'd a mine too and his woman work by his side what happened I asked breathlessly oh guilty of this and contempt of that blown up brine a sword took my last minute for fines and then explained that she was remitting the rest because I was a farter and uneducated his eyes grew dark for a moment he chuckled again but I wasn't going to serve all those fancy little prison sentences forcible citizenship and doctrine nation they call it shook the dead dry dust of the miss begotton god forsaken mother world from my feet forever the women on it deserve their men my pockets were folded from the fines and the paddle feet were looking for me so close I didn't dare radio for more minute so I stood away for a moment I didn't understand him when I did I was almost ill you mean I choked that you're breaking the law right now and I'm with you while you're doing it you leaned over the edge of the bunk and started me very seriously what breed of cat pole are they turning out these days besides what business do you have this close to the whole after a moment of sober reflection I nodded you're right I've become almost a male outside the law we're in this together he gafaud then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster I found myself drawn to the bright killer tube with exactly the fascination system cis such things of always had for men for an annual label that's not right for us prouting tadpole I'll call you forward my names but but leave brown I like the sound of Ford is but a nickname to yeah short for Alberta but I haven't found a man who can draw blaster fast enough to call me that you see pop came over in the 80s the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario named all us boys after Canadian provinces my was the youngest so I got the name there was saving for a girl you had a lot of brothers mr but he grinned with a mighty set of teeth a whole one nest full of course they were all killed in the blue shicago rising by the mcregr boys all except me and Saskatchewan then sassin me hunted the mcregras down took a heap of time we didn't float jack mcregras ugly face down the tusk and atill both of us were pretty near grown up I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of the blaster above the firing button have you killed a lot of men with that mr but just plain but to you Ford he frowned inside it at the light globe no more than 12 not counting five government paddle feet of course I'm a peaceful planter where I figure it violence never accomplishes much that's important my brother sass now he had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother when the dinner gone rang but told me to scat he said I was a growing head pole and needed my vitamins and he mentioned very offhand that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh fruit it seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat and but was used to a farmer's diet trouble was he was a special kind of farmer or anary fruit would have been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets in meals I even found a way to handle the kelp in giant watercress mr brown light but things like seaweed salt and venousian mud grapes just had to strong a smell twice the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering and I had to wash in myself but I learned so many wonderful things about venous every time I visited that store away I learned three wild wave songs of the flat folk and what it is that the native genusians hate so much I learned how to tell the difference between a lousy government paddle foot from new calamazoo and the slapto slinker who is the planters friend after a lot of begging but Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster explained it so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer but no matter what he would never let me hold it sorry for old ad he withdraws spinning around and around in the controls swivel chair with the nose of the lifeboat but way I look at it the man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like a giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found when you grown enough so's your pop feels you are to have a weapon why then's the time to learn it and you might as well learn fast for then you're playing too young to be even near it I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age I don't even have an older brother is out of my family like your brother laborer door all I have a sis and she she'll marry some fancy dry horn who'd never been further south than the polar coast and she'll stay out of the family if I know her breed of green shata bossy opinionated by the way 40 he said rising and stretching so the fish leather bounced and rippled off his biceps well that's sister she ever and he'd be off again cross examining me about Evelyn I sat in the swivel chair he vacated and tried to answer his questions but there was a lot of stuff I didn't know Evelyn was a healthy girl for instance how healthy exactly I had no way of finding out yeah I saw tell him my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than the average number of children no we'd never done any forming to speak of back in undersea but yes I guess I have all knew about as much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure pump regulation how would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture most of the other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talk to each other during the lecture but not my sister she hung on every word took notes even and asked enough questions to make the perspiring person really work in those orientation periods I am very sorry miss sparring he said with pretty heavy sarcasm but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Marco continent since the human population as well below one per thousand square miles it can readily be understood that the quantity of till soil land or subsurface is so small that wait I remember something the macro continent exports a fruit though not exactly an edible one the while dungeon drug is harvested thereby criminal speculators contrary to belief on earth the traffic has been growing in recent years in fact pardon me sir I broken but does it dungeon come only from leaf erics in island off the Moscow peninsula of the macro continent a euro member percher wanglies third exploration where he proved the island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year the person not it slowly my forgot he admitted sorry ladies but the boys write please make the correction in your notes but sis was the only one who took notes and she didn't take that one she stared at me for a moment biting her lower lip thoughtfully while I got sicker and sicker then she shut her pad with the final gesture of the right hand that mom used to use just before challenging the opposition to come right down on the council floor and debate it out with her for denan sis said let's go back to our cabin the moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me I knew I was in for it I've been reading up on venousian history in the ship's library I told her in a hurry no doubt she said drily she shook her night black hair out but you are going to tell me that you read about gunging in the ship's library the books there have been censored by a government agent of earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible young male minds like yours she would not have allowed this terror-nagent paddelfoot I sneered sis sat down hard in our zoom air chair now that's a term she said carefully that is used only by a venousian riff rath they're not not what riff rath I had to answer knowing I was getting in deeper all the time and not being able to help it I mustn't give Mr. Brown away their trappers and farmers pioneers and explorers who are building venous and it takes a real man to be able on a hot hungry hell like venous does it now she said looking at me is if I were beginning to grow a second pair of ears tell me more you can't have make law biting women ruled men when you start civilization on a new planet you've got to have men who aren't afraid to make their own law if necessary with their own guns that's where law begins the books get written up later you're going to tell for a man what evil criminal male is speaking through your mouth nobody I insisted there my own ideas they are remarkably well organized for a young boy's ideas the boy who I might add has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy I plan to have a government career on that new planet you talk about fernan after I have found a good study husband of course and I don't look forward to a masculineist radical in the family now who has been filling your head with all this nonsense I was sweating sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels someone is lying I pulled my pull pest hangar to my pocket to wipe my face something rattle to the floor what is that picture of me doing in your pocket fernan? a trap seemed to be hinging noiseily into place one of the passengers wanted to see how you look in a bathing suit the passengers on this ship are all female I can't imagine any of them that curious about my appearance fernan it's a man who has been giving you these anti social ideas isn't it a war mungering masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in government and don't have the vaguest idea how to except of course in their ancient bloody ways fernan who has been perverting that sunny and carefree soul of yours nobody nobody fernan there's no point in lying I demand I told you sis I told you and don't call me fernan call me fern fernan now you listen to me fernan after that it was all over both a confession that came in a few moments I couldn't fool sis she just knew me too well I decided miserably besides she was a girl all the same I wouldn't get mr but leave brown into trouble if I could help it I made sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to him and the quick nodding way she said she would made me feel just a little better the door opened on the signal sesame when but saw somebody was with me he jumped and the ten inch blaster barrel grew out of his fingers then he recognized sis from the pictures he stepped one side and with the same sweeping gesture helped her his blaster and pushed his green hood off it was sis's turn to jump when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back and on her miss sporling he said in that rumbly voice please come right in there's a hurry up draft so sis went in then I followed right after her mr brown closed the door I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hand or explanation but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in the control section with sis she didn't give ground though I'll say that for her she only came to his chest but she had her arms crossed sternly first mr brown she began like talking to a clock of a kid in class you realized that you are not only committing the political crime of traveling without a visa and the criminal one of stowing away without paying your fair but the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency he opened his mouth to its maximum with and raised an enormous hand then he left the air out and dropped his arm I take it you either have no defense or care to make none sis added costically but laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word one or if all the unorough talk like that and you want to foul up Venus we haven't done so badly on earth after the mess you man made of politics it needed a revolution of the mothers before needed nothing everybody wanted peace earth is a weirdo world it's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours mr Alberta leave brown hearing his rifle name made him move suddenly in tower over her sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone what do you have to say about storing away and using up life both stores he cocked his head and considered a moment look he said finally I have more than enough unit to pay for round trip tickets but I couldn't get a return visa because of that brunt assorted judge at all the charges she hung on me had to store away pick the unorough's belt because a couple of the boys in the crew were friends of mine and they were willing to help but this lifeboat don't you know that every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs not to mention the food I didn't eat because it's stuck in my throat yes she said bitterly you had this boy steal fresh fruit for you I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him equally guilty no sis he didn't I was beginning to argue all he wanted sure I knew and I knew that if I'm picked up as a store I'll be said back to earth to serve out those fancy little sentences well you're guilty of them aren't you he waved his hands at her impatiently I'm not talking law female I'm talking since listen I'm in trouble because I went to earth to look for a wife you're standing here right now because you're on your way to Venus for a husband so let's sis actually staggered back let's let's what or are are you daring to suggest that that now miss borrowing no who plot I'm saying let's get married and you know it you figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing on you for a wife your healthy and strong got good heredity you know how to operate subservice machinery you've lived underwater and your dispositions know worse than most of the enora I've seen prolific stock too I was so excited I just had to yell Jesus say yes my sister's voice was gleaming was scorn and what makes you think that I'd consider you a desirable husband he spread his hands as you nearly bigger if you wanted a poodle you're pretty enough to pick one of on earth figure if you charge off to Venus you don't want a poodle you want a man I'm one I own three islands in the Galerton or Capelligo that'll be good oozing mud grape land when they're cleared not to mention the rich Brazilian beds offshore I got no bad habits outside of having my own way I'm also passable good looking for a slap toe plentor besides if you marry me you'll be the first made it on this ship and that's a splash most nesting females like to make there was a long stretch of quiet sister stepped back and measured him slowly with her eyes there was a lot to look at he waited patiently while she covered the distance from his peculiar green boots to that head of hair I was so excited I was gulping instead of breathing imagine having but for a brother and law and living on a wet plantation in flat food country but then I remembered sis's level had and I didn't have much hope anymore you know she began there's more to marriage than just so there is he caught in well we can try each other for taste and he pulled her in both of his great hands practically covering her slim straight back neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go but spoke up first now me he said I'd well yes sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side of her mouth then she stepped back slowly and looked at him as if she were figuring out how many feet high he was she kept on moving backward tapping her chin while but and I got more impatient when she touched the lifeboat door she pushed it open and jumped out but ran over and looked down the crossway after a while he shot the door and came back beside me well he said swinging to a bunk that sort of it you're better off but I burst out you shouldn't have a woman like sis for a wife she looks small and helpless but don't forget she was trained to run an underwater city wasn't worried about that he grinned I grew up in the 15 long years of the blue Chicago rising nope he turned over on his back and clicked his teeth at the ceiling think we have nested out nicely I hitched myself up to him and we sat on the bunk gloaming away at each other then we heard the tramp of feet in the crossway but swung down and headed for the control compartment in the nose of a lifeboat he had his glass or out and was cursing very interestingly I started after him but he picked me up by the seat of my jumper and tossed me to order the door the captain came in and tripped over me I got all tangled up in his

Sis had to let go she grabbed my free hand and pulled me away she was trying to look only annoyed but her eyes had bright little bubbles of fury popping in them the cheap extra votes and they called themselves responsible women I was angry too and I let her know once we were in our cabin what about that promise Sis you said you wouldn't turn him in you promised she stopped walking around the room as if she had been expecting to get divinus on foot I know I did for a man but he forced me my name is Ford and I don't understand your name is for a man and stop trying to act forcefully like a girl

fundamentally decent chap despite his barbaric notions on equality between the sexes are worse I was positive I could shame him into a more rational social behavior and make him give him self up then he he she pressed her finger nails into her palms and let out a long layering sigh at the door then he kissed me oh it was a good enough kiss Mr Brown has evidently had a buried and colorful background but the galling idiocy of the man trying that I was just getting over the colossal impunence involved in his proposing marriage as if he had to bear the children and was considering the offer seriously on its merits as one should consider all suggestions when he deliberately dropped the pretence of reason he appealed to me as most of the savage ancients appealed to their women as an emotional machine throw the correct sexual switches says this theory and the female surrenders herself ecstaticly to the doubtful and bloody murk of masculine plans there was a double knock on the door in the captain walked in without waiting for an invitation he was still holding but splaster he pointed it at me get your hands up for an and sparring he said I did I hear by order your detention

for the sake of other men who were trying to break down terrestrial anti-mail prejudice of course there's a way out there is tell me please can I lower my hands a minute I asked no you can't son not according to the arm surveillance provisions of the mother Anita law miss sparring if you'd marry Brown now now don't look at me like that we could let the whole matter drop a shipboard wedding and he goes on your passport as a dependent male member of family which means so far as the law is concerned that he has a regulation passport from the beginning of this voyage and once we touch venusians soil he can contact his bank and pay for passage on the record no crime was ever committed he's free the bar is free and you are married to an unconfirmed Esperato who doesn't know enough to sit back and let a woman run things oh you should be ashamed the captain shrugged and spread his arms wide perhaps I should be but that's what comes of putting men into responsible positions as you say see here miss sparring I didn't want to arrest Brown and if it's at all possible I'd still prefer not to the crew officers and men all go along with me we may be legal residents of earth but our work requires us to be on venus several times a year we don't want to be disliked by any member of the highly irritable brown clan or it's collateral branches but leave Brown himself for all of his savage

telewall flickered and we turned it on sis smiled down everything's all right captain come up in Marius please what did you stick him for he asked what was the price sis's full lips went thin and hard the way mom's used to then she thought better of it and left Mr Brown is going to see that I'm elected sheriff of the Galerton archipelago but I thought she's sublivered a country clerkship the captain muttered as we spun up to the brig the doors were open and girls were chattering in every corner sis came up to the captain to discuss arrangements I slipped away and found but sitting with folded arm in the corner of the brig he granted me I'd have a like this flash I shook my head unhappy but why did you do it I sure love to be your brother and Robert gosh you don't have to marry sis I pointed to some of the bustling females sis was going to have 300 prides baits any one of them would have jumped at the chance to be your wife and once on any woman's passport you'd be free why sis

"A bunch of keys, where they were found and what they might have unlocked - A Christmas book",Various; Tom Hood,223448,5.0,"October 15, 2019","['\n        Publishers used to publish books like this at Christmas to be given as presents and it is quite common for them not to have any Christmas based stories in them. They usually contained a number of stories and maybe poems from different authors that had usually been published before. Soit was probably called a Christmas Book      ', '\n        This is a collection of 19th century relationship dramas, primarily about false love, really bad fathering decisions, or both, (very) loosely organized around the appearance of keys somewhere in the story. They are all well written, by different authors, none of whom I\'ve heard of (and I read a lot of 19th century fiction), which makes me wonder about the true story behind the creation of this collection. \n\nI also wonder why on earth it is subtitled ""A Christmas Book."" The stories are not Christmas-themed in any way, shape, or form. Christmas is not even mentioned. And they don\'t all end happily, so if you\'re looking for a book that\'s going to give you that peace on earth, all-is-well-with-the-world feeling, this isn\'t it. In particular, anyone who\'s ever struggled to care for a severely ill dependent while impoverished may want to skip the one about the key to the nursery cupboard. \n\nHowever, if it isn\'t Christmas, and you go into it open-eyed, this is a perfectly good book, and the readers are mostly fine (except one who needs to keep an eye on the speedometer, as she tended to exceed the speed limit).

One Sepony Time and I venture to think that a very seasonable commencement for a preface. Once upon a time there were half a dozen young writers. Who? Having to toil for their daily bread, all the rest of the year, desired at this period of it to make a Christmas pudding. The good old custom of Christmas annuals seemed to them one, which should not be allowed to die out altogether. And they set about planning a volume after that model. The following system of stories is what they decided upon. One of their number having been elected to the honorable post of editor. It became his duty to write this preface. But for that duty, I am inclined to think that post would have been a sign of care. This Christmas volume, then, has something more than ordinary of a Christmas nature about it. For it is in real truth. The growth of friendly communion, of pleasant chance of an evening. Of fellowship, of taste and feeling. It is a pet child, a hobby of hours in short, and a labor of love. If the public, therefore, like the notion as well as we do, next year, we'll see a successor to a bunch of keys. And I need hardly add that we hope when the festive season returns again.

30 Ghost Stories,Various,281740,14.0,"September 16, 2019",[],0,"rg. Recording by Kurt Ziggler, Lake Placet Florida. 30 Gold Stories by various authors. Story 1, The Follade Hand by Guida Mopassong. One evening about eight months ago, I met with some college comrades at the lodgings of our friend Lewis R. We drank punch and smoke, talked of literature and art, made jokes like any other company of young men. Suddenly the door flew open, and one who had been my friend since boyhood burst in like a hurricane. Guess where I come from, he cried. I bet on the may-veal, responded one, no said another, your two gay, you come from borrowing money from bearing a rich uncle, or from ponding your watch. You're getting sober, cried a third, and as you send it the punch in Lewis's room, you came up here to get drunk again. You're all wrong, he replied, I come from Pee in Normandy, where I have spent eight days, and whens I have brought one of my friends a great criminal, whom I ask permission to present to you. With these words he drew from his pocket a long black hand, from which the skin had been stripped. It had been severed at the wrist. It's dry and shriveled shape, and the narrow yellow nails still clinging to the fingers made it frightful to look upon. The muscles which showed that its first owner had been possessed of great strength were bound in place by a strip of parchment like skin. Just fancy said my friend, the other day they sold the effects of an old sorcerer recently deceased, well known in all the country. Every Saturday night he used to go to which gatherings on a broomstick. He practiced the white magic and the black, gave blue milk to the cows, and made them wear tails like that of the companion of Saint Anthony. The old scandal always had a deep affection for this hand, which he said was that of a celebrated criminal, executed in 1736 for having thrown his lawful wife headfirst into a well, for which I do not blame him, and then hanging in the bell-free the priest to admire him. After this double exploiting went away, and during his subsequent career, which was brief but exciting, he robbed 12 travelers, smoked a score of monks in their monastery, and made a cerralio of a convent. But what are you going to do with this horror we cried? A par blue, I will make it the handle of my doorbell and frightened my creditors. My friend said Henry Smith, a big, fluggomatic Englishman, I believe that this hand is only a kind of indenmeat, preserved by a new process, I advise you to make bullion of it. Real not, Miss yours, said, with the utmost sang Freud, a medical student who was three quarters drunk, but if you follow my advice peer, you'll give this piece of human debris Christian burial, for a fair list its owner should come to demand it. Then too, this hand has acquired some bad habits, for you know the proverb, who has killed Will Kill. And who has drank Will drink, replied the host as he poured out a big glass of punch for the student, who emptied it at a drought and slid dead drunk under the table. His sudden drop-in out of the company was greeted with the burst of laughter, and Pierre raising his glass and saluting the hand cried, I drink to the next visit of my master. Then the conversation turned upon other subjects, and shortly afterward each returned to his lodgings. About two o'clock the next day I was passing Pierre's door, I entered and found him reading and smoking. Well, how goes it, said I, very well he responded, and your hand? My hand, did you not see it on the bell pole? I put it there when I returned home last night. But, I propose of this, what do you think? Some idiot doubtless to play a stupid joke on me, came ringing at my door towards midnight. I demanded who was there, but as no one replied, I went back to bed again and to sleep. At this moment the door opened and the landlord, a fat and extremely important and person, entered without saluting us. Sir, said he, I pray you take away immediately that carrying which you have hung to your bell pole. Unless you do this I shall become pale to ask you to leave. Sir, responded Pierre with much gravity, you and Sala hand which does not merit it. You know that it belonged to a man of high breeding? The landlord turned on his heel and made his exit without speaking. Pierre followed him, detached the hand and affixed it to the bell-coord hanging in his o'clove. That is better, said he. This hand, like the brother, almost die, of the trappists, will give my thoughts a serious turn every night before I sleep. At the end of an hour I left him and returned to my own apartment. I slept badly the following night and was nervous and agitated and several times awoke with a start. Once I imagined even that a man had broken into my room and I sprang up and searched the closets and under the bed. Towards six o'clock in the morning I was commencing to doze at last when allowed knocking at my door made me jump from my couch. It was my friend Pierre's servant, aftress, pale and trembling. Acer, cried he, sobbing, my poor master, someone has murdered him. I dressed myself hastily in ram to Pierre's lodgings. The house was full of people disputing together and everything was in a commotion. Everyone was talking at the same time, recounting and commanding on their currents in all sorts of ways. With great difficulty I reached the bedroom, made myself known to those guarding the door and was permitted to enter. Four agents of police were standing in the middle of the apartment, pencils in hand, examining every detail, conferring in low voices and writing from time to time in their notebooks. Two doctors were in consultation by the bed on which lay the unconscious form of Pierre. It was not dead, but his face was fixed in an expression of the most awful terror. His eyes were open their widest, and the dilated pupils seemed to regard fixively, with unspeakable horror, something unknown and frightful. His hands were clenched. I raised the quilt which covered his body from the chin downward, and saw on his neck, deeply sunk in the flesh, the marks of fingers. Some drops of blood spotted his shirt. At that moment one thing struck me. I chanced to notice that the shriveled hand was no longer attached to the bell cord. The doctors had doubtless removed it to avoid the comments of those entering the chamber where the wounded man lay, because the appearance of this hand was indeed frightful. I did not inquire what had become of it. I now clip from a newspaper of the next day, the story of the crime with all the details that the police were able to procure. A frightful attempt was made yesterday on the life of young, amperes, be student, who belongs to one of the best families in Normandy. He returned home about 10 o'clock in the evening, and excused his valet, boven, from further attendance upon him, saying that he felt fatigue didn't was going to bed. Towards midnight, bovene was suddenly awakened by the furious ringing of his master's bell. He was afraid and lighted a lamp and waited. The bell was silent about a minute, then rang again with such remnants that the domestic, mad with fright, flew from his room to awaken the concierge, who ran to summon the police, and at the end of about 15 minutes, to policeman forced open the door. A horrible sight met their eyes. Furniture was overturned, giving evidence of a fearful struggle between the victim and his assailant. In the middle of the room, upon his back, his body rigid, with livid face and frightfully dilated eyes, lay motionless, young Pierre B. Baring upon his neck, the deep imprints of five fingers. Dr. Bordion was called immediately, and his report says that the aggressor must have been possessed of prodigious strength, and have had an extraordinarily thin and sinewy hand, because the fingers left in the flesh of the victims five holes like those from a pistol ball, and had penetrated until they almost met. There is no clue to the motive of the crime or to its perpetrator. The police are making a thorough investigation. The following appeared in the same newspaper next day. Mishir Pierre B, the victim of the frightful assault of which we published in the count yesterday, has regained consciousness after two hours of the most acidious care by Dr. Bordion. His life is not in danger, but is it strongly feared that his lost his reason. No trace has been found of his assailant. My poor friend was indeed insane. For seven months I visited him daily at the hospital where we had placed him, but he did not recover the light of reason. In his delirium strange words escaped him, and like all madman, he had one fixed idea. He believed himself continually pursued by a specter. One day they came for me and haste, saying he was worse, and when I arrived I found him dying. For two hours he remained very calm, then suddenly rising from his bed in spite of our efforts, he cried, waving his arms as if a prey to the most awful terror, take it away, take it away, is strangled me, help, help. Twice he made the circuit of the room uttering horrible screams, then fell faced downward dead. As he was in orphaned I was charged to take the body to the little village of pee in Normandy, whereas parents were buried. It was the place from which he had arrived the evening he found us drinking punch and Louis Sarr's room, when he had presented us the flayed hand. His body was enclosed in a lead coffin, and four days afterwards I walked sadly beside the old Kire, who had given him his first lessons to the little cemetery where they dug his grave. It was a beautiful day, and sunshine from a cloudless sky flooded the earth, bird sang from the blackberry bushes where many a time when we were children we had stolen to eat the fruit. Again I saw a pier and myself creeping along behind the hedge and slipping through the gap that we knew so well, down at the end of the little plot where they buried the poor. Again we would return to the house with cheeks and lips black with the juice of the berries we had eaten. I looked at the bushes they were covered with fruit. Mechanically I picked some and bore to my mouth. The Kire had opened up his bravery and was muddering his prayers in a low voice. I heard at the end of the walk the spades of the grave diggers who were opening the tomb. Suddenly they called out. The Kire closed his book and we went to see what they wished of us. They had found a coffin, indigene a stroke of the pickaxe had started the cover, and we perceived within a skeleton of unusual stature, laying on its back, it's hollow-wise, seemingly a two-menace and a faeus. I was troubled, I know not why, and almost afraid. Hold, cried one of the men. Look there. One of the rascals' hands had been severed at the wrist. Ah, here it is, and he picked up from beside the body a huge withered hand and held it out to us. See? cried the other laughing. See how he glars at you, as if he would spring at your throat to make you give back his hand. Go, said the Kire, leave the dead in peace and close the coffin. We will make poor pears grave elsewhere. The next day all was finished and I returned to Paris after having left fifty francs with the old Kire for masses to be said for the repose of the soul of him whose steplic are we had troubled.

3 SF Stories by Jack Williamson,Jack Williamson,318242,6.0,"August 8, 2019",[],0,"itlibriVox.org. Recording by Phil Shinovare, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The Cosmic Express. This story was first published in amazing stories November 1930. Mr. Eric Stokes Harding. Tom Moldado the rumpled bed clothing. A striking slender figure in purple striped pajamas. He smiled fondly across to the other of the twin beds where Nada, his pretty bride, lay quiet beneath light silk covers. With a groan, he stood up and began a series of fantastic bending exercises, but after a few half-hearted movements, he gave it up and walked through an open door into a small bright room. It's walls covered with bookcases, and also with scientific appliances that would have been strained to the man of four of five centuries before when the age of aviation was beginning. Yawning, Mr. Eric Stokes Harding stood before the great open windows staring out. Below him was a wide park-like space, green with emerald lawns and bright with flowering plants. 200 yards across it rose and emits pyramidal building and artistic structure, gleaming with white marble and bright metal, striped with a virtue of terrorist roof gardens. It's slender peak rising to help support the gray, still rib glass roof above. Beyond the park stretched away in illimitable vistas, broken with the graceful columned buildings that held up the great glass roof. Above the glass, over this New York of 2432AD, a freezing blizzard was sweeping, but small concern was that to the lightly-clad man at the window, who was inhaling deeply the fragrant air from the plants below. Air kept winter and summer exactly at what did he agree sent to grade? With another Yawning, Mr. Eric Stokes Harding turned back to the room, which was bright with a rich golden light that poured in from the suspended globes of the cold, atolite that eliminated the snow-covered city. With a distasteful grimace, he seated himself before a broad paper littered desk, sat a few minutes leaning back with his hands clasped behind his head. At last he straightened reluctantly, slid a small, typewriter out of its drawer and began pecking at it impatiently. For Mr. Eric Stokes Harding was an author. There was a whole shelf of his books on the wall in bright jackets, red and blue and green, that brought a thrill of pleasure to the young novelist's heart when he looked up from his claddering machine. He wrote thrilling action romances as his enthusiastic publishers and television directors said, of ages past when men were men, red-blooded heroes responding vigorously to the stirring passions of primordial life. He was impartial as to the source of his thrills, provided they were distant and off from modern civilization. His hero was likely to be an ape man roaring through the jungle with a bloody rock in one hand, and a beautiful girl on the other. Or cowboy, her writing, hard shooting, the vanishing hero of the ancient ranches, or a man marooned with a lovely woman at desert South Sea Island. His heroes were invariably strong, fearless, resourceful fellows who could handle a club on equal terms with a cave man, or call science to aid them in defending a beautiful mate from the terrors of desolate wilderness. And a hundred million red Eric's novels and watched the dramatization of them on the television screens, they thrilled at the simple romantic lives as heroes led, paid him handsome royalties, and subconsciously shared his opinion that civilization had taken all the best from the life of man. Eric had settled down to the artistic satisfaction of describing the sensuous lights of his hero in the roasted marrow bones of a dead mammoth, when the pretty woman in the other room stirred, and presently came tripping into the study, gay and vivacious and, as her husband of a few months, most justly thought, all together beautiful in a bright silk dressing gown. Racklessly he slammed the machine back into its place and resolved to forget that its next red-blooded action thriller was due in the publisher's office at the end of the month. He sprang up to kiss his wife, held her embrace for a long, happy moment, and then they went hand in hand to the side of the room in punched a series of buttons on a panel, a separate way of ordering breakfast sent up the automatic shaft from the kitchens below. Nara Stokes Harding was also an author. She wrote poems back to nature stuff, a simple lyrics of the sea of sunsets of bird songs, of bright flowers and warm winds, of thrilling communion with nature and growing things. Man read her poems and called her a genius, even though the whole world had grown up into a city, the birds were extinct, there were no wildflowers, and no one had time to bother about sunsets. Eric Darling, she said, isn't it terrible to be cooped up here in this little flat away from the things we both love? Yes, dear. Civilization has ruined the world. If we could only have lived a thousand years ago when life was simple and natural, when men hunted and killed their meat instead of drinking synthetic stuff, when men still had the joys of conflict instead of living under glass like hot house flowers. If we could only go somewhere, there isn't anywhere to go. I write about the West, Africa, South Sea Islands, but they were all filled up 200 years ago. Pleasure resorts, sanatorium, cities, factories. If only we lived on Venus, I was listening to a lecture on the television last night. The speaker said that the planet Venus is younger than the Earth, that it has not cooled so much. It has a thick cloudy atmosphere and low rainy forests. There is simple elemental life there, like Earth had before civilization ruined it. Yes, Ken's Lee with his new infrared ray telescope, that penetrates the cloud layers of the planet, prove that Venus rotates in about the same period as Earth, and it must be much like Earth a million years ago. Eric, I wonder if we could go there. It would be so thrilling to begin life like the characters in your stories to get away from this hateful civilization and live natural lives. Maybe a rocket, the young author's eyes were glowing. He skipped across the floor, sees not a kisser ecstatically, splendid think of hunting in the virgin forest, of bringing the game home to you, but I'm afraid there is no way. Wait, the cosmic express. The cosmic express? A new invention just perfected a few weeks ago I understand, by Ludwig von der Walls, the German physicist. I quit bothering about science. It has ruined nature, filled the world with silly artificial people doing silly, artificial things. But this is quite remarkable dear, a new way to travel by ether, by ether? Yes, you know, of course, that energy and matter are interchangeable terms. Those are simply etheric vibration of different sorts. Of course, that's elementary, she smile proudly. I can give you examples even of the change. The disintegration of the radium atom, making helium and lead into energy, and militant's old proof that his cosmic ray is generated when particles of electricity are united to form an atom. Fine, I thought you said you weren't a scientist. He'd load with pride. But the method in the new cosmic express is simply to convert the matter to be carried into power, send it out as a radiant beam, and focus to beam, to convert it back into atoms at the destination. But the amount of energy must be terrific. It is, you know, short waves carry more energy than long ones. The express ray is an electromagnetic vibration of frequency far higher than that of even the cosmic ray, and correspondingly more powerful and more penetrating. The girl frowned running slim fingers through golden brown hair. But I don't see how they get any recognizable object, not even how they get the radiation turned back into matter. The beam is focused, just like the light that passes through a camera lens. The photographic lens using light rays picks up a picture and reproduces it again on the plate. Just the same as the express ray, picks up an object and sets it down on the other side of the world. An analogy from television might help. You know that by means of the scanning disk, the picture is transformed into mere rapid fluctuations in the brightness of a beam of light. And a parallel manner, the focal plane of the express ray moves slowly through the object, progressively dissolving layers of the thickness of a single atom, which are accurately reproduced at the other focus of the instrument, which might be in Venus. But the analogy of the lens is the better of the two. For no receiving instrument is required as the intelligent television. The object is built up of an infinite series of plane layers at the focus of the ray, no matter where that might be. Such a thing would be impossible with radio apparatus, because even with the best beam transmission, all but a tiny fraction of the power is lost, and power is required to rebuild the atoms. Do you understand here? Not altogether, but I should worry, here comes breakfast. Let me butter your toast. A bill had run at the shaft. She ran to it and returned with a great silver tray, laden with 20 dishes, which she set on a little side table. They sat down opposite each other, and ate. Getting as much satisfaction from contemplation of each other's faces as from the excellent food. When they had finished, she carried the tray to the shaft, slit it in a slot, and touched a button, thus disposing of the culinary care of the morning. She ran back to Eric, who was once more staring distastefully at his typewriter. Oh, darling, I'm thrilled to death about the cosmic express. If we could go to Venus, do a new life on a new world and get away from all this hateful conventional society. We can go to their office, it's only five minutes. The chap that operates the machine for the company is a pile of mine. He's not supposed to take passengers except between the offices. They have scattered around the world, but I know his weak point. Eric laughed fumbled with a hidden spring under his desk. A small polished object gleaming silvery slid down into his hand. Old friendship plus this would make him light spinach. Five minutes later, Mr. Eric's stokes hearting, and his pretty wife, were in street clothes, light silk tunics of loose flowing lines, little clothing being required in the artificially warm city. The internet elevator and dropped 30 stories to the ground floor of the great building. There they entered a cylindrical car with rows of seats down the sides. Not greatly different from an ancient subway car except that it was airtight, and was hurled by magnetic attraction and repulsion through a tube exhausted of air, at a speed that would have made an old subway rider gas with amazement. In five more minutes, their car had whipped up to the base of another building in the business section, where there was no room for parks between the mighty structures that held the unbroken glass roofs to hundred stories above the concrete pavement. An elevator brought them up 150 stories. Eric led not a down a long carpeted corridor to a wide last door, which were the words, Cosmic Express stenciled in gold capitals across it. As they approached, a lean man carrying a black bag, darted out of an elevator shaft opposite the door, ran across the corridor and entered, they pushed in after him. They were in a little room, cut in two by a high brass grill. In front of it was a long bench along wall that reminded one of the waiting room in an old railroad depot. In the grill was a little window with a lazy brown-eyed youth leaning on the shelf behind it. Beyond him was a great glittering piece of mechanism, half hidden by the brass. A little door gave access to the machine from the space before the grill. The thin man in black whom Eric now recognized as a prominent French heart specialist was dancing before the window, waving his bag frantically raving at the scissorly be boy. Quick, I have to tell you the truth. I have the most urgent necessity to go quickly. A patient I have in Paris is the most critical condition. Hold your horses, just a minute mister. We got a client in the machine now, rushing diplomat from Moscow to Rio de Janeiro. $270.80 please, your turn next. Remember, this is just an experimental service. Regular installations all over the world in the year. Ready now, come on in. The youth took the money pressed a button. The door sprang open in the grill and the frantic physician leaped through it. Lied down on the crystal face up the young man ordered hands at your sides. Don't breathe. Ready? He manipulated his dials and switches and pressed another button. While, hello, Eric. Oh man, he cried. That's the lady you were telling me about. Congratulations. A bell jangled before him on the panel. Just a minute, I've got a call. He punched the board again. Little bulbs lit and glowed for a second. The youth turned to were the half-hidden machine spoke courteously. All right, madam, walk out. Hope you found the transient pleasant. But my violet, my precious violet, a shrill female voice came from the machine. Sir, what have you done with my darling violet? I'm sure I don't know, madam. You lost it off your hat. None of your impart minutes, sir. I want my dog. Ah, the dog. I must have jumped off the crystal. You can have him sit on for 300 in young men. If any harm comes to my violet, I'll, I'll appeal to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals. There we go, madam. We appreciate your patronage. The door flew open again. A very fat woman puffing angrily face highly colored, clothing shimmering with artificial gems, waddled pumplessly out of the door through which the frantic French doctor had so recently vanished. She rolled heavily across the room and out into the corridor. Shrill words floated back. I'm going to see my lawyer. My precious violet. The salo youth went. And now what can I do for you, Eric? We want to go to Venus if that ray of yours can put us there. To Venus? Impossible. My orders are to use the express merely between the 16 designated stations at New York San Francisco Tokyo London Paris. See here, Charlie, with a cautious glance toward the door. Eric held up the silver flask for all time sake and for this. The boy seemed dazed at sight of the bright flask. Then with a single swift motion, he snatched it out of Eric's hand and bent to conceal it below his instrument panel. Sure, old boy. I'll send you to heaven for that. If you give me the micrometer readings to set the ray with, but I tell you, this is dangerous. I've got a sort of television attachment. For focus in the ray, I can turn that on Venus. I've been amusing myself watching the life they're already. Terrible place. Savage. I can pick a place on high land to set you down, but I can't be responsible for what happens afterward. Simple, primitive life is what we're looking for. And now what do I owe you? Oh, that's all right. Between friends provided that stuff's genuine, walking and lie down on the crystal block and that your sides don't move. A little door has swung open again, and Eric led not through. They stepped into a little cell, completely surrounded with mirrors and vast prisms and lenses and electron tubes. In the center was a slab of transparent crystal, eight feet square and two inches thick with an intricate mass of machine re-bllowed. Eric helped not to a place on the crystal lay down at her side. I think the express ray is focused just at the surface of the crystal for below, he said, it dissolves our substance to be transmitted by the beam. He would look as if we were melting into the crystal. Ready? Call the youth. I think I've got it for you. Sort of a high island in the jungle. Nothing bad in sight now, but I say, how are you coming back? I haven't got time to watch you. Go ahead, we aren't coming back. Gee, what is it, Lopeman? I thought you were married already or is it business difficulties? The bears didn't make an awful raid last night, but you better let me set you down in Hong Kong. A bell jangled, so long, the youth called, not an Eric felt themselves enveloped in fire. Sheets of white flames seemed to lap up about them from the crystal block. Suddenly there was a sharp tingling sensation where they touched the polished surface. Then, blackness, blankness. The next thing they knew the fires were gone from about them. They were lying in something extremely soft and fluid, and warm rain was beating in their faces. Eric set up, found himself in a mud puddle. Besides him was not opening her eyes and struggling up, her bright garments stained with black mud. All about rose a thick jungle, dark and gloomy and very wet. Palm like the gigantic trees were flinging clouds of feathery green fully its high against a somber sky of unbroken gloom. They stood up triumphant. At last, not a cried, we're free, free of an hateful old civilization. We're back to nature. Yes, we're on our feet now, not parasites on the machines. It's wonderful to have a fine strong man like you to trust in Eric. You're just like one of the heroes in your books. You're the perfect companion, not a. But now we must be practical. We must build a fire, find weapons, set up a shelter of some kind. I guess it will be night pretty soon, and Charlie said something about savage animals he has seen in the television. We'll find a nice dry cave and have a fire in front of the door and skins of animals to sleep on, and pottery vessels to cook in, and you will find seeds and grow rain. But first, we must find a Flint bed. We need plants for tools and to strike sparks to make a fire with. We will probably come across a chunk of virgin copper to, it's found native. Presently, they settle through the jungle. The mud seemed to be very abundant and of a most sticky consistency. They sank into it ankle deep in every step, and vast masses of it clung to their feet. A mile they struggled on without finding where a prominent nature had left them a single fragment of quartz to say nothing of a mass of pure copper. A dawn shamed, Eric grumbled, come 40 million miles, and meet such a reception as this, not a stopped. Eric, she said, I'm tired, and I don't believe there's any rock here anyway. You'll have to use wooden tools sharpened in the fire. Perhaps you're right. This soil seems to be of aloeuvian origin. Wouldn't be surprised if the native rock is some hundred to feet underground, your idea is better. You can make a fire by rubbing sticks together, can't you? It can be done, I'm sure. I've never tried it myself, but we need some dry sticks first. They resumed the weary march with a good fraction of a new planet adhering to their feet. Rain was still falling from the dark heavens and a steady warm down poor. Dry wood seemed scarce as the proverbial hen's teeth. You didn't bring any matches, dear? Matches, of course not. We're going back to nature. I hope we get a fire pretty soon. If dry wood were gold dust we couldn't buy a hot dog. Eric, that reminds me that I'm hungry. He confessed to a few pangs of his own. They turned their attention to looking for beneditries and coconut palms, but they did not seem to abound in the venerian jungle. Even small animals that might have been slain with a broken branch had contrary ideas about the matter. Adlasts from sheer wearyness they stopped and gathered branches to make a sloping shelter by a vast fallen tree trunk. This will keep us out of the rain, maybe, Eric set hopefully, and tomorrow when it has quit raining I'm sure we'll do better. They crept in as gloomy night fell without. They lay in each other's arms the body warmth oddly comforting, not a cried a little. Walk up, Eric and Vicer, we're back to nature, where we've always wanted to be. With a darkness the temperature fell somewhat, and they high wind rose whipping cold rain into the little shelter, and threatened nature demolish it. Swarms of mosquito-like insects seemingly not inconvenienced in the least by the inclement elements swarmed about them in clouds. Then came a sound from the dismal stormy night, a horse-bullowing roar, rockus terrifying. Not a clung to Eric. Oh, what is it, dear? She chattered. Must be a reptile, dinosaur, or something of that sort. This world seems to be about in the same state as the earth when they flourished there, but maybe it won't find us. The roar was repeated, nearer. The earth trembled beneath a mighty tread. Eric, a thin voice trembled. Drone, you think it might have been better. You know, the old life was not so bad after all. I was just thinking of our rooms, nice and warm and bright, with hot fuz coming up the shaft whenever we push the button, and the gay crowds in the park and my old typewriter. Eric? She calls softly. Yes, dear. Don't you wish we had known better? I do. If he went step the Wii, the girl did not notice. The roaring outside was closer, and suddenly it was answered by another rockus spell-o at considerable distance that echoed strangely through the forest. The fearful sounds were repeated alternately, and always the more distance seemed nearer until the two sounds were together. And then an infernal dyn broke out in the darkness, bellows, screams, deafening shrieks, mighty splashes, as if struggling titans had upset oceans. Thunderous crashes, as if they were demolishing forests. Eric and not a clung to each other, endowed, whether to stay or to fly through the storm. Gradually the sound of the conflict came nearer until the earth shook beneath them, and they were afraid to move. Suddenly, the great fallen tree against which they had erected the flimsy shelter was rolled back, evidently by a chance blow from the invisible monsters. The pitiful roof collapsed on the bit-dragled humans, not a burst in jettires. Oh, if only, if only. Suddenly, flame locked up about them. The same white flame they had seen as they lay on the crystal block. Dissiness, in sensibility overcame them. A few minutes later, they were lying on the transparent table in the cosmic express office, with all those great mirrors and prisms and lenses about them. A bustling red face-to-fifial appeared through the door in the grill, fairly bubbling apologies. So, sorry, an accident inconceivable. I can't see how we got it. We got you back as soon as we could find a focus. I sincerely hope you haven't been injured. Why, what, what, what, why I happened in, found our operator drunk? I've no idea where he got the stuff. He remembered something about Venus. I consulted the auto-register and found two more passengers registered here that had been reported at our other stations. I looked up the duplicate beam coordinates and found that it had been set on Venus. I got men on the television at once, and we happened to find you. I can't imagine how it happened. I had the fellow locked up in the dry lures or on the job. I hope you won't hold us for excessive damages. No, I asked nothing except that you don't press charges against the boy. I don't want him to suffer for it in any way. My wife and I will be perfectly satisfied to get back to our apartment. I don't wonder. You look as though you've been through. I don't know what, but I'll have you there in five minutes. My private car.

Chapter 1 Down the Rabbit Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but had no pictures or conversations in it. And what is the use of a book thought Alice without pictures or conversations? So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid. Whether the pleasure of making a Daisy chain would be worth the double of getting up and picking the daisies. When suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that. Nor did Alice think it's so very much out of the way to hear a rabbit say to itself, oh dear, oh dear, I shall be late. When she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she onto a wondered at this. But at the time it all seemed quite natural. But when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet. For it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it. And burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it. Unfortunately was just in time to see it popped down a large rabbit hole under the hedge. In another moment, down with Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down. So suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep or she felt very slowly. For she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her into wonder what was going to happen next. First she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to. But it was too dark to see anything. Then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves. Here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pigs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment it was empty. She did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Well thought Alice to herself. After such a fall as this I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave though all think me at home? Why I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house, which was very likely true. Down, down, down. When the fall never come to an end, I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time she said aloud. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. Let me see. That would be 4,000 miles down I think. For you see, Alice had learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school room. And though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over. Yes, that's about the right distance. But then I wonder what latitude or longitude I've got to. Alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either. But thought they were nice grand words to say. Presently she began again. I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth. How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walked with their heads downward. The end, tip of these I think? She was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn't sound at all the right word. But I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia? And she tried to curts the issue spoke, fancy curts seeing as you're falling through the air. Do you think you could manage it? And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking? No, it'll never do to ask. Perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere. Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. Dino, this would be very much tonight I should think. Dino was the cat. I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at T-time. Dino, my dear. I wish you were down here with me. There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder. And here Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way. Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats? And sometimes do bats eat cats? Where you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dino, and saying to her very earnestly. Now Dino, tell me the truth, did you ever eat a bat? When suddenly, thump thump, down she came on a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up to her feet in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark overhead. Before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurting down it. There was not a moment to be lost, away went Alice like the wind, it was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner. Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting. She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked. And when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly, she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall. But, alas, either the locks were too large or the key was too small, but at any rate, it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about 15 inches high. She tried a little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted. Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat hole. She knelt down and looked along the passage into the lovely scarred new ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wandered around among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway, and even if my head would go through thought poor Alice, it would be very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope. I think I could, if I only knew how to begin. For you see, so many out of the way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things, indeed, were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it, which certainly was not here before said Alice. And round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, but the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say drink me, but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. No, I'll look first, she said, and see whether it's Mark Poison or not. She had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things. All because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them, such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long, and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds. And she had never forgotten that if he drank much from a bottle of Mark Poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later. However, this bottle was not Mark Poison, so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, it had in fact a sort of mixed flavor of cherry tart, custard pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot butter toast. She very soon finished it off. But a curious feeling said Alice, I must be shutting up like a telescope. And so it wasn't deep, she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further. She felt a little nervous about this. For at my end, you know, said Alice to herself, in my going out altogether like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then. And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, but she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once. But a last report Alice, when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten a little golden key. And when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it. She could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table. But it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little things sat down and cried. Come, there's no use crying like that, said Alice to herself rather sharply. I advise you to leave off this minute. She generally gave herself very good advice, though she very seldom followed it. And sometimes she scolded herself so spirally as to bring tears into her eyes. And once she remembered trying to box her own ears, her having cheated herself in a game of croquet, she was playing against herself. For this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. But it's no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be two people. Why there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table. She opened it and found in it a very small cake, a witch the words eat me, repeatedly marked in currents. Well, I'll eat it, said Alice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key. And if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door. So either way, I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens. She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, which way, which way? Holding your hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing. And she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake. But Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she said to work in very soon finished off the cake.

The caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence. At last, the caterpillar took the hook out of its mouth and addressed her in a language sleepy voice. Who are you? Said the caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied rather shall we? I hardly know sir, just a present. At least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then. What do you mean by that? Said the caterpillar's sternly. Explain yourself. I can't explain myself. I'm afraid sir, because I'm not myself, you see? I don't see. Said the caterpillar. I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly. Alice replied very politely. For I can't understand it myself to begin with, and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing. It isn't. Said the caterpillar. Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet. Said Alice. But when you have to turn into a chrysalis, and you will someday you know. And then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it's a little queer, long-sue. Not a bit. Said the caterpillar. Well, perhaps your feelings might be different. All I know is it would feel very queer to me. You said the caterpillar, contenturously. Who are you? Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks. And she drew herself up and said very gravely. I think you ought to tell me who you are first. Why? Said the caterpillar. Here was another puzzle in question, and as Alice could not think of any good reason. And as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. Come back. The caterpillar called after her. I have something important to say. This sounded promising, certainly. Alice turned and came back. Keep your temper. Said the caterpillar. Is that all? Said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. No. Said the caterpillar. Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do. And perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking. But at last it unfolded its arms. Took the hook out of its mouth again and said, So, you think you're a change to do you? I'm afraid I am. Said Alice. I can't remember things as I used to. And I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together. Can't remember what things said the caterpillar. Well, I've tried to say how dust the little busy bee, but it all came different. Alice replied in a very million-coli voice. Repeat, you are old father William. Said the caterpillar. Alice folded her hands and began. You are old, father William, the young man said, And your hair has become very white. And yet you, and, suddenly, stand on your head, Do you think at your age it is right? In my youth, if I the William replied to his son, I feared it might injure the brain. But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again. You are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat. Yet you turn a back summer salt in at the door. Pray, what is the reason for that? In my youth, said the sage, as he shook his gray locks, I kept all my limbs very supple. By the use of this ointment, one shilling the box, Allow me to sell you a couple. You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suit, yet you finish the goose with the bones And the beak, pray, how did you manage to do it? In my youth, said the father, I took to the law And argued each case with my wife, And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw Has lasted the rest of my life. You are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever, yet you balance And eel on the end of your nose, would made you so awfully clever. I have answered three questions, and that is enough. Said his father, don't give yourself aears. Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? Be off or I'll kick you downstairs. That is not said right. Said the caterpillar. Not quite right, I'm afraid. Said Alice, timidly. Some of the words have got altered. It is wrong from beginning to end. Said the caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes. The caterpillar was the first to speak. What size do you want to be? It is. Oh, I'm not particular as to size. Alice hastily replied, only one doesn't like changing. So often you know, I don't know. Said the caterpillar. Alice said nothing. She had never been so much contradicted in her life before, And she felt that she was losing her temper. Or you can tent now. Said the caterpillar. Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir. If you wouldn't mind, said Alice. Three inches is such a wretched height to be. It is a very good height indeed. Said the caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke. It was exactly three inches high. But I'm not used to it, pleaded poor Alice in a pideous tone, And she thought of herself. I wish these creatures wouldn't be so easily offended. You'll get used to it in time. Said the caterpillar and put the hookah into its mouth, And began smoking again. This time, Alice wetted patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two, the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, And yawed once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass. Nearly remarking as it went. One side will make you grow taller, And the other side will make you grow shorter. One side of what? The other side of what? Thought Alice to herself. Of the mushroom, said the caterpillar, Just as if she had asked it out loud. And in another moment, it was out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, Trying to make out which were the two sides of it. And as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms around it as far as they would go, And broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. And now, which is which, she said to herself, And nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin, It had struck her foot. She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, But she felt that there was no time to be lost, As she was shrinking rapidly. So she said to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, That there was hardly room to open her mouth. But she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the left hand bit. Come, my heads free at last, set Alice in a tone of delight, Which changed into alarm in another moment When she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found. All she could see when she looked down was an immense length of nick, Which seemed to rise like a stock out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below. What can all that green stuff be, set Alice, And we are half my shoulders got to, And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you? She was moving them about as she spoke, But no result seemed to follow, Except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, She tried to get her head down to them, And was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, Like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, And was going to dive in among the leaves, Which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees, Under which she had been wandering. When a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry, A large pigeon had flown into her face, And was beating her violently with its wings. Serpent screamed the pigeon. I am not a serpent, said Alice, And did not leave. Let's be alone. Serpent, I say again, repeated the pigeon, But in a more subdued tone, And added with a kind of a sub. I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them. I haven't the least idea what you're talking about, said Alice. I've tried the roots of trees, And I've tried banks, And I've tried hedges, the pigeon went on, Without attending to her, But those serpents, there's no pleasing them. Alice was more and more puzzled, But she thought there was no use in saying anything more Until the pigeon had finished. As if it wasn't trouble enough, Hatching these eggs, said the pigeon, But I must be on the lookout for serpents, night and day. Why I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks. I'm very sorry you've been annoyed, said Alice, It was beginning to see its meaning. And just as I've taken the highest tree in the wood, Continue to pigeon raising its voice to a tree. And just as I was thinking, I should be free of them at last, They must need to come wriggling down from the sky. Ugh, serpent. But I'm not a serpent, I tell you, said Alice. I'ma, I'ma. Well, what are you, said the pigeon? I see you're trying to invent something. Um, I'ma little girl said Alice, Rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes She had gone through that day. I'll likely story indeed, said the pigeon in a tone of deep past content. I've seen a good many little girls in my time, But never one with such a neck as that. No, no, you're a serpent, And there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you've never tasted an egg. I have tasted egg certainly, Said Alice, who was a very truthful child. But with the girls, e.x. quite as much as serpents do, You know? I don't believe it, said the pigeon. But if they do, why then there are kind of serpents, That's all I can say. This was such a new idea to Alice, That she was quite silent for a minute or two, Which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding. You're looking for eggs. I know that well enough, and what does it matter to me, Whether you're a little girl or a serpent. It matters a good deal to me, said Alice, Hacily, but I'm not looking for eggs as it happens. And if I was, I shouldn't want yours. I don't like them, braw. Well, be up then, said the pigeon in a sulky tone, As it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees, As well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled Among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while, she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, And she set to work very carefully, Nibbling first at one, and then at the other, And growing sometimes taller, and sometimes shorter, And she'll she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since she had been anything near the right size That it felt quite strange at first, But she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual. Come, there's half my plan done now, How puzzling all these changes are. I'm never sure what I'm going to be from one minute to another. However, I've got back to my right size. The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden, How is that to be done, I wonder. As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place With a little house in it about four feet high. Whoever lives there thought Alice, It'll never do to come upon them this size, But I should frighten them out of their whiffs. So she began nibbling at the right hand again, And did not venture to go near the house Till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.

Many great and wonderful deeds are recorded of your state in our histories, but one of them exceeds all the rest in greatness and valor. For these histories, tell of a mighty power which unprovoked maiden expedition against the whole of Europe and Asia, and to which your city put in end. This power came forth out of the Atlantic Ocean. For in those days, the Atlantic was navigable, and there was an island situated in front of the Straits, which are by you called the Pillars of Hercules. The island was larger than Libya and Asia put together, and was the way to other islands. And from these, you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent, which surrounded the true ocean. For this sea, which is within the Straits of Hercules, is only a harbor, having a narrow entrance. But that other is a real sea, and the surrounding land may be most truly called the Balonlis continent. Now, in this island of Atlantis, there was a great and wonderful empire, which had ruled over the whole island and several others, and over parts of the continent. And furthermore, the men of Atlantis had subjected the parts of Libya within the columns of Hercules as far as Egypt and of Europe as far as Thirchini. This vast power gathered into one in Devert to Sadhu, at a blow our country and yours, and the whole of the region within the Straits. And then so in your country, shown forth in the excellence of Her virtue and strength among all mankind. She was preeminent, encouraged, and military skill, and was the leader of the Haleens. And when the rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone, after having undergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated and triumphed over the invaders. And preserved from slavery, all those who were not yet subjugated, and generously liberated all the rest of us who dwell within the pillars. But afterwards, there occurred violent earthquakes and floods, and in a single day and night of misfortune, all your war-like men in a body sank into the earth. And the island of Atlantis, in like manner, disappeared in the depths of the sea, for which reason the sea and those parts is impossible and impenetrable, because there is a show of mud in the way, and this was caused by the subsidence of the island.

Translators' process. A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to understand his work. Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hardworking and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious character. Though always sickly and delicate, Dostoevsky came out third in the final examination of the Petersburg School of Engineering. There he had already begun his first work, poor folk. This story was published by the poet Nacresov in his review and was received with acclimations. The shy, unknown youth found himself instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he was arrested. Though neither by temperament nor conviction or revolutionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men who met together to read for yay and prudon. He was accused of, quote, taking part in conversations against the censorship of reading a letter from Balinski to Go Go, and of knowing of the intention to set up a printing press, unquote. Under Nacresov, the first that stern and just man, as Marie Sparing calls him, this was enough and he was condemned to death. After eight months imprisonment, he was with 21 others, taken out the Semyonovsky square to be shot. Writing to his brother, Mial, Dostoevsky says, they snapped words over our heads, and then made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to death. Thereupon, we were bound in threes to stakes to suffer execution. Being the third and the row, I had concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones, and I contrived a kiss, plus jive, and Dorav, who were next to me, into Bidham farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo. We were unbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his majesty had spared our lives. The sentence was commuted to hard labor. One of the prisoners, Gregoriev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and never regained his sanity. The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on Dostoevsky's mind, though his religious temper led him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation, and to regard it as a blessing in his own case, he constantly recurres to the subject in his writings. He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where he began the dead house, and some years of service, in a disciplinary battalion. He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest, and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times a year, and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal, Ramya, which was forbidden by the censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864, he lost his first wife and his brother Mihal. He was in terrible poverty. Yet he took upon himself the payment to his brother's debts. He started another journal, the epic, which within a few months was also prohibited. He was waited down by debt. His brother's family was dependent on him. He was forced to write at harpreking speed, and is said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife. In June 1880, he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the monument to Pushkin and Moscow, and he was received with extraordinary demonstrations of love and honor. A few months later, Dostoyovsky died. He was followed to the grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who, quote, gave the halfless man the funeral of a king, unquote. He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia. In the words of a Russian critic who seeks to explain the feeling inspired by Dostoyovsky, he was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered and seen so much more deeply than we have, his insight and presses us as wisdom. That wisdom of the heart which we seek that we may learn from it how to live, all his other gifts came to him from nature. This he won for himself and through it he became great and of translators' purpose.","Dramatic Readings, Literary Fiction",English,21:19:44,LibriVox Volunteers,"['Russian', 'Schwidrekalov', 'English', 'Polish', 'Tavarish', 'Altyvacan']","['Keterina Ivanovna Mamiladova', 'Gentleman', 'Petrovich Luzin', 'Antonio Sotopatiniu', 'Lianjou', 'Cheryl Hounds', 'Marie Sparing', 'Liseveta', 'Dramatis Persona', 'Sash Elliott', 'Perfiri Petrovich', 'Krigorevic Zamietov', 'Chris Pyle', 'John Burlinson', 'Tye Emptual', 'Pukeria Alexandrovna', 'David Perti', 'Michelle Eaton', 'Joseph Cavler', 'Beth Thomas', 'Christine G.

Nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some value, should interfere in the matter. I really have other things to engage me. So spoke short homes and turned back to the great scrapbook in which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material. But the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex. She held her ground firmly. He was a family. You are right and affair for a lodge of mine last year, she said, Mr Ferdel Hobbs. Ah, yes, a simple matter. But he would never cease talking of it, your kindness sir, and the way in which you've brought light into the darkness. I remembered his words when I was in doubt and darkness myself. I know you could if you only would. Homes was accessible upon the side of flattery and also to do him justice upon the side of kindness. The two forces made him lay down his gunbrush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair. Well, well, Mrs Warren, let us hear about it, man. You don't object to tobacco. I take it. Thank you, Watson. The matches. You are uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodge remains in his rooms and you cannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs Warren. If I were your lodgeer, you often would not see me for weeks on end. No doubt, sir, but this is different. It frightens me, Mr Holmes. I can't sleep for fright. To hear his quick step moving here and moving there, from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him. It's more than I can stand. My husband is as nervous over it as I am, but he is out at work all day, while I get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What is he done? Except for the girl I am all alone in the house with him, and it's more than my nerves can stand. Holmes leaned forward and laid his long thin fingers upon the woman's shoulder. He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished. The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated features smooth into their usual colonplace. She sat down in the chair which he had indicated. If I take it up, I must understand every detail, said he, take time to consider. The smallest point may be the most essential. You say that the man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight's port and lodging. He asked my terms, sir, I said fifty shillings a week. There is a small sitting room and bedroom, and all complete at the top of the house. Well, he said, I'll pay you five thousand a week if I can have it on my own terms. I'm a poor woman, sir, and a mist of war and earns little, and the money meant much to me. He took out a ten-pound note, and he held it out to me then and there. You can have the same every fortnight for a long time to come if you keep the terms he said, if not, I'll have no more to do with you. What were the terms? Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key of the house. That was all right. Lodges often have them. Also, that he was to be left in tiny to himself and never upon any excuse to be disturbed. Nothing wonderful in that, surely. Not in reasons, sir, but this is out of all reason. He has been there for ten days, and neither Mr. Warren nor I, nor the girl, has once said I, so upon him. We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down, up and down, night, warning, and noon, but except for that first night, he had never once gone out of the house. Oh, he went out the first night, did he? Yes, sir, and returned very late, after we were all in bed. He told me after he had taken the room that he would do so, and asked me not to bar the door. I heard him come up the stairs after midnight. But his meals, it was his particular direction that we should always, when he rang, leave his meal upon a chair outside his door. Then he rings a game when he has finished, and we take it down from the same chair. If he wants anything else, he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it. Prince it? Yes, sir. Prince it's impenetal. Just the word, nothing more. Here's the one I brought to show you. Soap. Here's another, match. This is one he left the first morning. Daily Gazette. I leave that paper with his breakfast every morning. Dear me, Watson said home, staring with great curiosity at the slips of fools cap, which the land they had handed to him. This is certainly a little unusual. Seclosion I can understand, but why print? Printing is a clumsy process. Why not write? What would it suggest, Watson? That he desired to conceal his handwriting. But why? What can it matter to him that his land lady should have a word of his writing? Still, it may be, as you say, then again, why such luckonic messages? I cannot imagine. It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation. The words I written were the broad pointed, violet tinted pencil, of a not unusual pattern. You'll observe that the paper is torn away at the side here after the printing was done so that the S of soap is partly gone. Suggestive Watson is it not? Of caution, it's exactly. There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something which might give a clue to the person's identity. Now, Mrs. Warren, you say that the man was of middle size dark and bearded. What age would he be? Youngest, sir, not over 30. Well, can you give me no further indications? He spoke good English, sir, and yet I thought he was a foreigner by his accent. And he was well dressed. Very smartly dresser, quite the gentleman, dark clothes, nothing you would note. He gave no name, no sir, and he had no letters or callers. None. But surely you or the girl enter his room of a warning. No sir, he looks after himself entirely. Dear me, that is certainly remarkable. What about his luggage? He had one big brown bag with him, nothing else. Well, we don't seem to have much material to help us. Do you say nothing has come out of that room? Absolutely nothing. The land that he drew an envelope from her bag, from it she shook out two burnt matches and a cigarette end upon the table. They were on his tray this morning. I brought them because I had heard that you can read great things out of small ones. Home shrugged his shoulders. There is nothing here, said he, the matches have, of course, been used, to light cigarettes. That is obvious from the shortness of the burnt end. After matches consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar. But dear me, this cigarette established certainly remarkable. The gentleman was bearded and moustacheed, you say. Yes sir, I don't understand that. I should say that only a clean, shaving man could have smoked this. Why, what's an even your modest moustache would have been sinched? A holder, I suggested. No, no, the end is matted. I suppose there could not be two people in your room, Mrs. Warren. No sir, he eats so little that I often wonder if it can keep life in one. Well, I think we must wait for a little more material. After all, you have nothing to complain of. You have received your rent and he is not a troublesome launcher, though he is certainly an unusual one. He pays you well, and if he chooses to like and sealed, it is no direct business of yours. We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it. I take an up the matter and I won't lose sight of it. Reports of me visiting fresh occurs and reliable my assistance if it should be needed. There are certainly some points of interest in his case Watson, he remarked when the land lady had left us. It may of course be trivial, individual eccentricity, or it may be very much deeper than appears on the surface. The first thing that strikes one is the obvious possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different from the one who engaged them. Why should you think so? Well, apart from his cigarette end was it not suggested that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms. He came back, or someone came back, when all witnesses were out of the way, we have no proof that the first new came back was the first new went out. Then again, the man who took the rooms folk English well. This other, however, Prince Match, when it should have been matches, I can imagine that the word was taken out of additionary, which could give the noun but not the plural, the laconic style may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of English. Yes Watson, there are good reasons to suspect that there has been the substitution of lodges. But for what possible end? Ah, there lies our problem. There is one rather obvious line of investigation. He took down the great book in which day by day he filed the agony columns of the various London journals. Dear me, said he turning over the pages, what a chorus of groan's cries and bleetings, what a rag bag of singular happenings, but surely the most valuable hunting ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual. This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired. How is any news or any message to reach him from without? Obviously by advertisement through a newspaper, there seems no other way and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here are the daily gazette extracts of the last fortnight. Lady with a black burger at Prince's skating club. That we may pass. Surely Jimmy will not break his mother's heart that appears to be irrelevant. If the lady who fainted on Brickston Bass, she does not interest me. Every day my heart longs bleet Watson unmitigated bleet. Ah, this is a little more possible. Listen to this. Be patient. We'll find some sure means of communications. Meanwhile, this column. G. That is two days after Mrs. Warren's lodger arrived. It sounds plausible does it not? The mysterious one could understand English even if he could not print it. Let us see if we can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we are, three days later.

It's all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren's lodger. If we wait a little Watson, I don't doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible. So it proved, for in the morning I found my friend standing on the half rug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete satisfaction upon his face. How's this, Watson? He cried, picking up the paper from the table. Hi, Red House with white stone facing's, third floor, second window left. After dusk, G. That is definite enough. I think after breakfast, we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren's neighborhood. Ah, Mrs. Warren. What news do you bring us this morning? Our client has suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy which told of some new unmomentous development. It's a police matter, Mr. Holmes, he cried. I'll have no more of it. He shall pack out of there with his baggage. I would have gone straight up and told him so. Only I thought it was about fair to you to take your opinion first. But I met the end of my patience, and when it comes to knocking my old man about. Knocking Mr. Warren about? Using him roughly, anyway. But who used him roughly? Ah, that's what we want to know. It was this morning, sir. Mr. Warren is a timekeeper at Morton and Waylights in Tottenham Court Road. He has to be out of the house before seven. Well, this morning he had not gone ten places down the road, when two men came up behind him, through a coat over his head and bottled him into a cab that was beside the curb. They drove him an hour and then opened the door and shot him out. He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab. When he picked himself up he found he was on Hampstead Heath, so he took of our home, and there he lies now on his sofa while I came straight round to tell you what had happened. Most interesting, said Holmes. Did he observe the appearance of these men? Did he hear them talk? No, he is clean, dazed. He just knows that he was lifted up as if I magic and dropped as if I magic. Two at least were in it and maybe three. And you connect this attack with your lodger? Well, we've lived there 15 years and no such happening ever came before. I've had enough of him. Money's not everything. I'll have him out of my house before the day is done. Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren. Do nothing rush. I begin to think that this affair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight. It is clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger. It is equally clear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door, mistook your husband for him in the foggy morning light. On discovering their mistake they released him, what they would have done had it not been a mistake we can only conjecture. Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes? I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren. I don't see how that has to be managed unless you break in the door. I always hear him unlock it as I go down the stair after I leave the tray. He has to take the tray in. Surely we can see those so I'll see him do it. The land they default from him. Well, sir, there's the box from opposite. I could arrange a looking glass maybe, and if you were behind the door. Excellent, said Holmes. When does he lunch? About once, sir. Then, Dr. Watson and I will come round in time. For the present, Mrs. Warren, goodbye. At half past twelve, we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs. Warren's house. A high thin yellow brick edifice in great all-and-street, a narrow thoroughfare at the northeastern side of the British Museum. Standing as it does near the corner of the street, it commands a view down how street with its more pretentious houses. Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these, a rare residential flats, which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye. See, Watson said he, high-red house with stone facings. There is a signal station all right. We know the place and we know the code, so surely our task should be simple. There's a to let card in that window. It is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has access. Well, Mrs. Warren, what now? I have it already for you. If you were both come up to leave your boots below on the landing, I would put you there now. It was an excellent hiding place, which she had arranged. The mirror was so placed that seated in the dark we could very plainly see the door opposite. We had hardly settled down in it and Mrs. Warren left us when a distant tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had run. Presently the land lady appeared with the tray, laid it down upon a chair beside the closed door and then treading heavily departed. Crouching together in the angle of the door we kept our eyes fixed upon the mirror. Suddenly, as the land lady's footsteps died away, there was the creak of a turning key. The handle revolved and two thin hands darted out and lifted the tray from the chair. An instant later it was hurriedly replaced and I caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful, horrified face, glaring at the narrow opening of the boxroom. The end of door crashed to the key turn once more on all the silence. Homes twitched my sleeve and together we stowed down the stair. I will call again in the evening said he to the expectant land lady. I think Watson we can discuss this business better in our own quarters. My surmise as you saw proved to be correct said he speaking from the depths of his easy chair. There has been a substitution of lodges. What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman and no ordinary woman Watson. She saw us. Well, she saw something to alarm her that is certain. The general sequence of events is pretty clear, is it not? A couple seek refuge in London from a very terrible and instant danger. The measure of that danger is the rigour of their precautions. The man who has some work which he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while he does it. It is not an easy problem but he sold it in an original fashion and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the land lady who supplies her with food. The printed messages as he's now evident were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. The man cannot come near the woman or he will guide their enemies to her. Since he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to the agony column of a paper. So far all is clear. But what is that the root of it? Ah yes Watson. So very practical as usual. What is that the root of it all? Mrs Warren's whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes a more sinister aspect as we proceed. This much we can say that it is no ordinary love-escape. You saw the woman's face at the sign of danger. We have heard too of the attack upon the landlord which was undoubtedly meant for the larger. These alarms and the desperate need to secrecy argue that the matter is one of life or death. The attack upon Mr Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female order for the male. It is very curious and complex Watson. Why should you go further in it? What have you to gain from it? What indeed? It is art for arts, sake Watson. I suppose when you adopted you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee. For my education, Holmes. Education never ends Watson. It is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last. This is an instructive case. There is neither money nor credit in it and yet one would wish to tidy it up. When dust comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our investigation. When we return to Mrs Warren's rooms the gloom of a London winter evening had thickened into one grey curtain. A dead monotone of colour broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred hallows of the gas lamps. As we appeared from the dark and sitting room of the lodging house one more dim light glimmed high up through the obscurity. Someone is moving in that room. Said Holmes in a whisper, his gauntlet eager face thrust forward to the window pane. Yes I can see his shadow. There he is again. He has a candle in his hand. Now he is peering across. He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout. Now he begins to flash. Take the message also Watson that we may check each other. A single flash that is A surely. Now then how many did you make it? 20. So did I. That should mean T. 80. That's intelligible enough. Another T. Surely this is the beginning of a second word. Now then T. E. N. T. A. Dead stop. That can't be all Watson. A. T. T. E. N. T. A. Gives no sense. Nor is it any better as three words. A. T. T. E. N. T. A. Unless T. A are a person's initials. There it goes again. What's that? A. T. T. E. Why? It is the same message over again. Curious Watson. Very curious. Now he is off once more. A. T. Why he is repeating it for the third time? A. T. T. E. N. T. A. Three times. How often will he repeat it? No, that seems to be the finish. He is withdrawn from the window. What do you make of it Watson? A cipher message home. My companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension. And not a very obscure cipher Watson said he, why of course it is Italian. The A means that it is addressed to a woman. Beware, beware, beware. How's that Watson? I believe you have hit it. Not a doubt of it. It is a very urgent message, thrice repeated to make it more so. But beware of what? Wait a bit. He is coming to the window once more. Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the small flame across the window as the signals were renewed. They came all rapidly then before. So, refid that it was hard to follow them. P. E. R. I. C. O. L. O. Pericola. What slack, Watson? Danger, isn't it? Yes, by Jov. It is a dangerous signal. There he goes again. P. E. R. I. Hello. What on earth? The light has suddenly gone out. The glimmering square of the window had disappeared and the third floor formed a dark band around the lofty building with its tears of shining casements. That last warning cry had been suddenly cut short. How? And by whom? The same thought occurred on the instant to us both. Holds sprang up from where he was crouched by the window. This is serious Watson he cried. There is some devilly going forward. Why should such a message stop in such a way? I should've thought it was a good way. I should've thought it was a good way. And yet, it is too pressing for us to leave. Shall I go for the police? We must define the situation as a more clearly. It may bear some more innocent interpretation. Come, Watson. Let us go across ourselves and see what we can make of it. Part two. As we walk rapidly down the house street, I glance back at the building which we had left. There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could see the shadow of the head, a woman's head, gazing tensly rigidly out into the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message. At the doorway of the house street flats a man, muffled in the crevat and great coat, was leaning against the railing. He started as the whole light fell upon our faces. Holmes, he cried. Why, Gregson said my companion as he shook hands with the Scotland yard detective. Journey's end with lovers' meetings. What brings you here? The same reasons that bring you, I expect, said Gregson, how you got onto it I can't imagine. Different threads but leading up to the same angle. I've been taking the signals. Signals? Yes from that window. They broke off in the middle. He came over to see the reason. But since it is safe in your hands, I see no object in continuing this business. Wait a bit, Crancregs and Eagley. I'll do you this justice, Mr. Holmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn't feel stronger for having you on my side. There's only the one exit to these flats, so we have him safe. Who is he? Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes. You must give us best this time. He struck his sticks sharply upon the ground on which a cadmine is wiffing his hands, saunted over from a four wheeler, which stood on the far side of the street. May I introduce you to Mr. Sherlock Holmes, he said to the cadmine. This is Mr. Leviton, of Pinkerton's American agency. The hero of the Long Island cave mystery, said Holmes. Sir, I am pleased to meet you. The American acquired business like young man, with a clean-shaven hatchet face, flushed up at the words of commendation. I am on the trail of my life now, Mr. Holmes, that he, if I can get Georgiano. What? Georgiano of the Red Circle? Oh, he has a European fame, as he? Well, we've learned all about him in America, we know he is at the bottom of 50 murders, and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on. I tracked him over from New York, and I've been close to him for a week in London, waiting some excuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Gregson and I ran him to ground in that big tenement house, and there's only one door, so he can't slip us. There's free folk come out since he went in, but I swear he wasn't one of them. Mr. Holmes talks of signals, Sir Gregson. I expect as usual he knows a good deal that we don't. In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation, as it had appeared to us, the American struck his hands together with vexation. He's onto us, he cried. Why do you think, Sir? Well, it figures out that way, does it not? Here he is sending out messages to an accomplice, there are several of his gang in London. Then suddenly, just as far your own account, he was telling them that there was danger, he broke short off. What could it mean, except that, from the window, his suddenly either caught sight of us in the street, or in some way, come to understand how close the danger was, and that he must act right away if he was to avoid it. What do you suggest, Mr. Holmes? That we go off at once and see for ourselves, but we have no warrant for his arrest. He is in unoccupied premises, under suspicious circumstances, said Gregson, that is good enough for the moment. When we have him by the heels, we can see if New York can't help us to keep him. I'll take the responsibility of arresting him now. Our official detectives may have londered in the matter of intelligence, but never in that of courage. Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desperate murderer with the same absolute quiet and business-like bearing, with which he would have ascended the official staircase of Scotland Yard. The finger-to-man had tried to push past him, but Gregson had firmly elbowed him back. London dangers were the privilege of the London force. The door of the left-hand flat, a form of third landing was standing a jar. Gregson pushed it open. Within all was absolute silence and darkness. I struck a match and lit the detectives' lantern. As I did so, and as the fricestered into a frame, we all gave a gas for surprise. On the deal boards of the carpetless floor, there was outline the fresh track of blood. The red stepped pointed towards us and led away from an inner room, the door of which was closed. Gregson flung it open and held his light full blazing front of him, while we all paired eagerly over his shoulders. In the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled, the figure of an enormous man, his clean-shavens walty face, grotesquely horrible in its contortion, and his head in circle-bound ghastly crimson halo of blood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork. His knees were drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the center of his broad brown-up turn-throat there projected the white half of a nice, driven blade deep into his body. Giant as he was, the man must have gone down, like a pole-act ox before that terrific blow. Beside his right hand, a most formidable horn handled, two-edged dagger lay upon the floor, and near it a black-kid glove. By George, its black-Georgiano himself, cried the American detective, someone has got ahead of us this time. Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes said, Gregson, why, whatever are you doing? Holmes, as step-to-cross, had lit the candle, and was passing it back wooden forward across the window-pains, then he peered into the darkness, blew the candle out and threw it on the floor. I rather think that will be helpful, said he. He came over and stood in deep thought, while the two professionals were examining the body. He said, that three people came out from the flight while you were waiting downstairs, said he had lost. Did you observe them closely? Yes. Was there a fellow about 30 black-bearded dark of middle-size? Yes, he was the last to pass me. That is your man, I fancy. I can give you his description, and we have a very excellent outline of his footmark. That should be enough for you. Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of London. Perhaps not, that is why I thought it best to summon this lady to your aid. We all turned round at the words. The air-framed in the doorway was a tall and beautiful woman, the mysterious lodger of Bloomsbury. Slowly she advanced, her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension, her eyes fixed and staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark figure on the floor. You have killed him, she muttered. Oh, dear mirror, you have killed him. Then I heard a sudden shot intake of her breath, and she sprang into the air with a cry of joy. Round and round the rim she danced, her hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a thousand pretty Italian exclamation pouring from her lips. It was terrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such a sight. Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning stare. If that's you, you are police are you not, you have killed which actually is your shearno. We are police, madam. She looked round into the shadows of the room. But where then is Janaro? She asked, he is my husband, Janaro Luka, I am Amelia Luka, and we are first from New York. Where is Janaro? He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with all my speed. It was I who called said Holmes. You? How could you call? Your cipher was not difficult, madam. Your presence here was desirable. I knew that I had only to flash Viennye and you would surely come. If you'd have a little Italian look with awe at my companion. I do not understand how you know these things she said. Resefi is your shearno. How did he, she pause? And suddenly her face lit up with pride and delight. Now I see it, my Janaro. My splendid beautiful Janaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm. He did it. With his own strong hand, he killed the monster. Oh, Janaro, how wonderful you are. What woman could ever be worthy of such a man? Well Mrs. Luka said the present Gregson, laying his hand upon the lady's sleeve with as little sentiment as if you were a notting hill hooligan. I not very clear yet who you are or what you are, but you said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the yard. One moment Gregson said Holmes, I rather fancy that this lady may be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it. You understand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the death of the man who lies before us. What you say may be used in evidence, but if you think that he has acted from motors which are not criminal and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot serve in better than by telling us the whole story. Now that George Janaro is dead, we fear nothing said the lady. He was a devil and a monster and there could be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him. In that case, said Holmes, my suggestion is that we lock this door, these things as we found them, go with this lady to her room and form our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us. Half an hour later we were seated all four in the small sitting room of Cignora Luca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those sinister events, the ending of which we had chance to witness. She spoke in rapid and fluent, but very unconventional English which for the sake of cleanness I will make grammatical. I was born in Posteri Lifer near Naples, said she, and was the daughter of Augusto Vereli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of that part. Génaro was in my father's employment and I came to love him as any woman must. He had neither money nor physician, nothing but his beauty and strength and energy, so my father for vath the match. We fled together were married in body and sold my jewels to gain the money which would take us to America. This was four years ago and we have been in New York ever since. Fortyoun was very good to us at first. Génaro was able to do a service to an Italian gentleman. He saved him from some ruffians in the place called the Vauri and so made a powerful friend. His name was Tito, Casterlotte, and he was the senior partner of the great firm of Casterlotte and Zambur, who are the chief fruit importers of New York. Cignora Zambur is an invalid and our new friend Casterlotte has all power within the firm which he employed more than 300 men. He took my husband into his employment, made him head of a department and showed his good will towards him in every way. Cignora Casterlotte was a vatula and I believe that he felt as if Génaro was his son and those my husband and I loved him as if he were our father. We had taken and furnished a little house in Brooklyn and our whole future seemed assured when that flat cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our sky. One night when Génaro returned from his work he brought a fellow countryman back with him. His name was Georgiano and he had come also from Posterlipeo. He was a huge man as you can testify for he have looked upon his corpse. Not only was his body that of a giant but everything about him was grotesque, gigantic and terrifying. His voice was like thunder in our little house. There was scarce room for the world of his great arms as he talked. His thoughts, his emotions, his passions all were exaggerated and monstrous. He talked or rather roared with such energy that others could but sit and listen, cowred with the mighty stream of words. His eyes blazed at you and held you at his mercy. He was a terrible and wonderful man. I thank God that he is dead. He came again and again, yet I was aware that Génaro was no more happy than I was in his presence. My poor husband would sit pale and listless, listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social questions which made up our visitors' conversation. Génaro said nothing but I, who knew him so well, could read in his face some emotion which I had never seen there before. At first I thought that it was disliked and then gradually I understood that it was more than disliked. It was fear, a deep secret shrinking fear. That night the night that I read his terror, I put my arms around him and I implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from me and tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so. He told me and my own heart grew cold as I, as I listened. My poor Génaro, in his wild and fiery days, when all the world seemed against him and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life, had joined a near-police and society derred circle which was allied to the old carbonary. The Oceans secrets of this Brotherhood were frightful but once within its rule no escape was possible. When we had fled to America, Génaro thought that he had casted all off forever. What was his horror one evening to meet in the streets, the very man who had initiated him in Naples, the giant Georgianna, a man who had earned a name of death in the south of Italy, for he was read to the elbow in murder. He had come to New York to a voyager talian police and he had already planted a branch of this dreadful society in his new home. All this Génaro told me and showed me a summons which he had received that very day. A red circle drawn upon the head of it, telling him that a lodge would be held upon a certain date and that his presence as it was required and ordered. That was bad enough but worse was to come. I had noticed for some time that when Georgianna came to us, as he constantly did in the evening, he spoke much to me and even when his words were to my husband, those terrible glaring, while beast eyes of his were always turned upon me. One night his secret came out, had awakened what he called love within him the love of a brute, a savage. Génaro had not yet returned when he came. He first his way in, seized me in his mighty arms, hugged me in his bears in brace, covered me with kisses, and implored me to come away with him. I was struggling and screaming when Génaro entered and attacked him. He struck Génaro senseless and fled from the house, which he was never water entered. It was a deadly enemy that we made that night. A few days later came the meeting, Génaro returned from it, with a face which told me that something dreadful had occurred. It was worse than we could have imagined possible. The fans of the society were raised by blackmailing Richard Talians and threatening them with violence that they refused the money. It seemed that Castellotte, our dear friend and benefactor had been approached. He had refused to yield to threats, and he had handed the notices to the police. It was resolved now that such an example should be made of them as would prevent any other victim from revealing. At the meeting it was arranged that he and his house should be blown up with dynamite. There was a drawing of lots as to who should carry out the deed. Génaro saw Aranam as cool face smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. No doubt it had been pre-arranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with the red circle upon it, the mandate for murder which lay upon his palm. He was to kill his best friend, or he was to expose himself and meet the vengeance of his comrades. It was part of their fiendest system to punish those whom they feared or hated by injury not only their own persons, but those whom they loved. And it was the knowledge of this which hung as a terror over my poor Génaro's head and drove him nearly crazy with apprehension. All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each strengthening each for the troubles that lay before us. The very next evening had been fixed for the attempt. By midday my husband and I were on our way to London, but not before he had given our benefact of full warning of this danger and also less such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future. The rest gentlemen you know for yourselves, we were sure that our enemies would be behind us like our own shadows. Georgiana had his private reasons for vengeance, but in any case, we knew how ruthless cunning and untiring he could be. Both Italy and America are full of stories of his dreadful powers. If ever they were exerted, it would be now. My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me. For his own part he wished to be free that he might communicate both with the American and with the Italian police. I do not myself know where he lived or how, or that I learned was through the columns of a newspaper. But once as I look through my window, I saw two Italians watching the house and I understood that in some way Georgiana had found our retreat. Finally, Janaro told me through the paper that he was signal to me from a certain window, but when the signals came they were nothing but warnings which was suddenly interrupted. It is very clear to me now that he knew Georgiana to be close upon him, and that, thank God, he was ready for him when he came. And now gentlemen I would ask you whether we have anything to fear from the law or whether any Georgiana for nurse would condemn my genado for what he has done. Well Mr. Greggson said to the American, looking across at the official, I don't know what your British point of view may be, but I guess that in New York this lady's husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks. She will have to come with me and see the chief Greggson answered, if what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her husband has much to fear, but what I can't make head or tail of Mr. Holmes is how on earth you got yourself mixed up in the matter. Education, Greggson education, still seeking knowledge at the old university. Well Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic anger attest to add to your collection. By the way, it is not eight o'clock, and a Wagner-Night at Covent Garden. If we hurry, we might be in time for the second act.

Preface, this translation of the characters of the Ophrastus is intended not for the narrow circle of classical philologist, but for the larger body of cultivated persons who haven't interest in the past. Within the last century, only three English translations of the characters have appeared, one by how London 1824, another by Isaac Taylor, London 1836, the third by Professor Jeb London 1870, all of these have long been out of print, a fact that seemed to justify the preparation of the present work.

A few course passages have been omitted, and occasionally a phrase necessary to the understanding of the context has been inserted apart from this, the translators have aimed to render the original with as much precision and fidelity as is consistent with English idiom. Charles E. Bennett, William A. Hammond, if he can New York August 1902. Introduction. What stories are new as factory, subtle observer of men? All types of all characters march through all fables, crimblers and boasters, victims and bullies, dupes and naves, long earnedies, giving themselves Leonine ears, tortu, wearing virtuous clothing, lovers and their trials, their blindness, their folly and constancy. With the very first page of the human story, do not love and lies to begin. So the tales were told ages before e-sup and asses under lion's mane's roared in Hebrew and slifoxes flattered in Etruscan and wolves in a sheep clothing nashed their teeth and Sanskrit, no doubt. The sun shines today as he did when he first began shining and the birds in the tree overhead while I am writing, seeing very much the same note they have sung ever since. There were fintures. There may be nothing new under and including the sun, but it looks fresh every morning and we'd rise with a tuto-o-o-ho-skim laugh-struggle-love-suffer until the night comes and quiet, and then will wake tomorrow and the eyes that look upon it, and so to capo. All this is very true, the changes which may be observed in human nature are small, and the old types of the frasters are all about us nowadays and really look and act much the same as they did to the eyes of the ancient parapodetic. Offices and institutions have somewhat changed, and many character types do to new vocations have come into being since then, E. G., the new swoy, the bishop, the reporter, the hotel clerk, and the jockey. But these are only accidents of civilization and the peculiarities of office or the type or professional character do not touch the vital essence of human nature, although they may modify its expression. When one speaks of a coward, one means an intrinsic quality in human kind, which is essentially the same, whether found in a hop-light or in a modern infantryman, but which may express itself differently in the two cases. The types described by Theo Frostas are types of such intrinsic qualities, and his pictures of ancient vices and weaknesses show man, much as we see them now. They are not merely types of professions or calling. Apart from slight variations of local coloring and institutions, the descriptions of the old Greek philosopher might apply almost as well to the president habitants of London or Boston as to the Athenians of 300 BC. Then, as now the flatterer applied his wily trade, indulging in smooth complement of his heroes' person, or actions. As he walks within acquaintance, he says behold, how the eyes of old men are turned upon you. There is not a man in the city who enjoys so much notice as yourself. Yesterday, your praises were the talk of the porch, while about 30 men were sitting there together, and the conversation fell upon the topic, who is on Ovala citizen, they all began and ended with your name. If his friend, as say a just, the flatterer, laughs and stuffs his sleeve into his mouth, as though he could not contain himself. But the flatterer of old could be subtle, too. He buys apples and pairs, carries them to his heroes' house, and gives them to the children, and in the presence of their father, he kisses them, exclaiming chips of the old block. And, while his talk is directed to others in the company, his eye is ever fixed upon his hero. Then, as now, there existed the officious man always overready to undertake the impossible, or to interfere in the affairs of others. At a banquet he forces the servants who mix more wine than the guest can drink. If he sees two men in a quarrel, he rushes in between, even though he knows neither one. If the doctor leaves instructions that no wine be given the patient, he administers just a little, on the plea that he wants to set the sufferer right. There existed, of course, then, as now, the tactless person who selects a man's abyssey a stower for a lengthy conference, and who sings a love-ditties under his sweetheart's window as she lies ill of a fever. At a wedding he declaims against woman-kind, and when a friend has just finished a journey, he invites him to go for a walk. If he happens to be standing by when a slave is flog, he tells the story of how he once flog the slave of his, who then went and hanged himself. There was the mean man, too, who, if his servant broke a pot or play, deducted its value from the poor fellow's rations. He permits no one to take a fig from his garden or cross his field, or even to pick up windfalls under his fruit trees. He forbids his wife to then salt or lamp wicks or a pinch of cumin, marjoram or meal, observing that these trifles make a Lord some in a year. There was also the thankless man whose pessimism is so gloomy as to cloud all view of his blessings. When a friend has sent him something from his table, he says to the servant who brings it, a grudge, me a dish of soup and a couple of wine, I suppose, and so couldn't invite me to dinner. He secures a slave at a bargain, after long-dickering with the owner, he says, I imagine I have a got much at this price, and to the person who brings him glad tidings that a son is born to him, he retorts, if you only add and have your fortunes gone, you'll hit it. Then we have the man who is ostentatious in a trivial things, when he has sacrificed an oxy, winds up the head and horns with filets, and nails them up opposite the entrance of his house. When he parades with the capo-ree, he gives all his accoutrement to his squire to carry home, and throwing back his mantle stalks proudly about the marketplace in his spurs. When his master of the Brittany, he craves the privilege of announcing to the people the result of the sacrifice, and as soon as he has delivered to the people, the momentist intelligence that the sacrifice has resulted well, he hides him home and recounts his crime to his wife in an ecstasy of joy. The foregoing are but illustrations of the happy skill with which the Ofraster has delineated a number of character types which are as universal as human nature, and no no limits of aid or of country. Here and there we meet a type in the Greek for which we have no exact counterpart in our customary modern modes of thought. Such a type may be seen in Theofrastus the disagreeable man, a person who seems a sort of a general nuisance with a touch of the bore and the bragged. As a rule however, the types are singularly like those we know today, and it is not difficult at once to provide them with appropriate modern labels. The treatment, though almost invariably brief, is invariably vigorous and trincent with a few bold strokes the character is drawn. There is absolutely no pretence of style as we ordinarily understand it, yet each type is in its way a gem. Through them all runs that fidelity to truth which was the unfailing inspiration of all Greek art. It is this which makes the characters a unique creation and vindicate their position as a part of the world's literature. It is largely for this reason that these slight sketches are here, produced and English exhibiting as they do when we compare them with what we see around us, the essential identity of human nature, in ages widely separated from each other in time and manners. There is furthermore an accidental interest in the work of Theofrastus due to the fact that it is the first recorded attempt at systematic character writing. Characters do be sure are portrayed in Homer and in the Trigidians, but they are incidental to the narrative or to the dramatic plot, whereas Inthiel Frasstus, the business is with the delineation of a character as such. He tells us what a man does simply as an illustration of what he is, and this method of writing had a very intimate bearing on the evolution of the new comedy under the leadership of Menendur. There is a tradition in fact that Theofrastus was the teacher of Menendur, who in turn furnished models for Terence in his delineation of conventional dramatic types. The influence of Theofrastus was further directly and potently exerted on the so-called character writers of the 17th century in England and France. The simple methods of these character writers and their un-involved sketches were succeeded by the more elaborate art of the novelists in whose works individuals rather than types are described by exhibiting their development in long periods of time and under great diversity of circumstances. We have little information as to the personal history of Theofrastus beyond what we learned from the extent fragments of his writings and from the meager biography of Diogenes of Leirty. He was born at Eris' a village on the island of Lesbos in 371 BC and his father was one Melantus, a father by trade. He first went to school to Al-Sippus in his native island, but afterwards traveled to Athens, the intellectual metropolis, and became a pupil of Plato at the Academy with whom he appears to have studied until the Master's death. Theofrastus was then in the 25th year. At that time he attached himself to Eris' model, who was some 12 years his senior and who had also been a member of the Academy until Plato died screvence. During the 12 years which he lapsed from the death of Plato until Eris' model established the new school of the Lyceum in a 335 BC, Theofrastus was probably with his new leader at least part of the time in Sagera or at the Macedonian court where the youthful Alexander was under the tutorial discipline of Eris' model. Theofrastus was an intimate friend of Calestine's the unfortunate fellow student and companion of Alexander and it is probable that the two studied together at Bella. The story is told that Eris' model, in speaking of these two pupils, said Calestine needs a spur, but they are frosty as a bridal. Many years later when Eris' model was dead and the Cassander, the character seven, had gained control of Alexander's throne. Theofrastus was invited to an office at the court where he had spent his student days and told him a sought-tare Cassander's political ally sent him an invitation to the court of Egypt, but he declined these calls into the social and political world and maintained steadfastly his devotion to philosophy. It was a fashion for the rectors or presidents of the great schools of Athens, such as the Sinozages, the Academy and the Lyceum, before their death, to name their successors in office. And so when Eris' model was asked who should succeed in the presidency of the Lyceum, tradition tells of the delicate way in which he left record of his wish. His two most distinguished pupils were Thiafraster's of Lesbus and Udimas of Rhodes. Eris' model replied to the question as to his successor by asking for two sorts of wine Lesbian and Rodian. After tasting of them, he said they are both excellent, but the Lesbian is the sweeter. thereby it was known that he had decided in favor of Thiafraster's who on the death of Eris' model, 32 BC, succeeded to the presidency of the Lyceum over which he continued to preside for 35 years. His administration was one of almost unparalleled success. Diogenes Leercius reports that 2000 students thronged to him, although not born at Athens, he was one of the most popular and beloved members of that somewhat exclusive community. This is illustrated by the story of Aganides, who preferred against him, a charge of atheism, a charge similar to that which brought Socrates to martyrdom and drove Eris' model into exile and caused his early death. But instead of injuring Thiafraster's Aganides, narrowly escaped paying a fine for his folly. Amongst his contemporaries Thiafraster's was a great personal force by reason of his amyble character, his charities and lavish benefactions, the amenity of his manners is great erudition and gifts of oratory. He died in 287 BC in the 85th year of his age and Diogenes Leercius says that the whole population of Athens honoring him greatly followed him to the grave. Thiafraster's was one of the greatest folly grabs of antiquity. 227 works are attributed to him. The range of his learning is similar to that of Eris' totals and with the emphasis laid rather more strongly on the side of natural science. His genius, however, is not marked by Eris' titles profundity. He served his age rather as a great popularizer of science. He was not an originator of epic-making ideas or theories. Yet, as a local and popular force, he surpassed Eris' title. His influence on subsequent ages, however, is less marked of the 227 works. Continuing 232,900 and eight lines attributed to Thiafraster's fragments of nine only are now extant excluding certain insignificant remains. It is a doubtless true, however, that he influenced his own time as much by his administrative ability in the conduct of the bicem and by his oral utterances as by his written treatises. His prodigious industry was no doubt partially inspired by Eris' title as well as by the swift stirring movement of the age, immediately preceding and following the death of Alexander, in which his literary manhood was passed. Time, he says, is the most valuable thing a man can spend. He expressed his sense of the value of order in the Apatham better trust a horse without bridle than a discourse without arrangement. His estimate of oral converts at table is recorded in a rather rust-an unathenian remark said to have been made by him to a silent neighbor at dinner. Sir, if you are an ignorant man, your conduct shows wisdom, but if you are a wise man, you act like a fool. The genuinely kind character of Thiafraster, however, is amply illustrated by the provisions of his will, which evidence is also his very considerable well. He had inherited from Eris' title, the largest private library then known. This library to which he had himself made notable additions, he bequeathed to Nileas his nephew, Thielfraster's never married, and by Nileas it was taken to Asia Minor where it was hidden in a cellar to avoid the repassity of the agents of the Attel in Denizde, who were ceasing all available books for the Royal Library at Purgumann. And hereby hangs the curious old story of the loss of Aristotle's works for 150 years until they were rediscovered Worm Eaton in the cellar of Nileas at Skepsis. A museum, temple of the muses, had been built by Thiafraster as the home of the Lysium. In his will he provided that this should be maintained and beautified that statues of the illustrious dead, particularly of Aristotle, should be completed for which commissions had already been given to the renowned sculptor, Praxitilies. Further, that tablets with maps of the world engraved on them should be erected in the lower Collinate. In economic matter of the claims of religion, he also directed that an altar should be placed there. He devised the garden, promenade, and houses, adjoining the garden to the joint control of his parka's Nileas, Stratto, and their successors as a trust in joining that school of philosophy should be maintained in them, and that the property should never be alienated from this purpose nor claim to as private possession. After piously making provision for certain friends, and the support of faithful attendance, he further directed that he should be buried in the school garden without unnecessary expense or ceremony. Thiafraster is more generally known for his character sketches than for his scientific work, although his treatises on botany represented the highest attainments made by science in that field during antiquity, and the Middle Ages. The treatise he translated, says for 30 types of characters striking to the Greek mind. They are probably a fragment or extract made by some a pitomator from a larger treatise which was suggested by the abstract ethical analyses of Aristotle as exhibited in the Necomakian ethics, and by the concrete dramatic representations of the new comedy. The stage suggests the form and Aristotle's treatise the content. They represent moral and social defects and weaknesses, though not revolting biases, but they do this in a magnetic way by exhibiting persons as acting or speaking. Thiafraster was a contemporary of philomenenemmonender, and his life was spent in the era of the revival of comedy, and the elaboration of current moral types for humorous presentation on the stage. So the characters of Thiafraster's are, as it were, Dremati's Pesonai of his time. He shows us how a given type of man speaks and acts, the dramatization of his characters would require scarcely anything more than stage setting. His portrayal is not satire, but imitation, not caricature, but realistic delineation from life. Moreover, this description of generic types rather than of individuals belongs to the literary fashion of his age. Looked at from this magnetic point of view, the characters of Thiafraster are historically all the more important because our knowledge of men and dure that 10th muse is so meager resting as it does upon scanty Greek fragments and a few Latin adaptations. These 30 sketches at the beginning of the post-classical age do not represent properly speaking, vices, and yet they were vices to the mind of the Greek, who measured his morality largely by the cannons of good form. Any violation of good taste or breach of courtesy was morally vicious. The disposition was to maintain and close unity, the natures of beauty and goodness, moderns discriminate sharply between the aesthetic and the moral. The social virtues of gentle reading and the graces of politeness toward their fellow men had for the classical Greeks and ethical nature as his witnessed in Aristotle's ethics, manners and morals were not sundered, what we call a social weakness or defect or a blemish grudity, Thiafraster's called advice. It is necessary to bear this in mind when one reads the moral characters as they are called in the Greek title. Amongst these characters there are no virtues and one may ask, why is it that in his portrayal of types Thiafraster's has altogether omitted any description of good men? The answer is not to be found in the supposition that such characters were originally included in the work but have since perished. The real ground for the omission is probably to be discovered in the nature of the conditions under which Thiafraster's wrote. These, as we have already indicated, were closely connected with the development of the new comedy. The portrayal of a good character may be edifying and may serve the conditions of tragedy, but it does not suit the purposes or surroundings of the comic stage where the ludicrous elements of weak eccentric or faulty personalities are the materials employed. The aim of Thiafraster is both to amuse and to instruct, but his instruction is given by exposing to ridicule certain faults which he elevates into the striking tangibility of a concrete character. The serious dignity and excellence of the good man, while it may suit the heroic conditions of the epic, the grave purpose of tragedy, or the aims of moral allegory offers no material for such sketches as these. Thiafraster's has no concern either with the grossly immoral or with the helplessly weak. The former awakened only discussed and hey, while the latter stir only feelings of pity and neither of these emotions can be kept active in the true art of comedy. Rightly speaking, the art of Thiafraster has to do only with folly or with such eccentricities and weaknesses, as have a humorous aspect, and it is only moral imperfections of this sort that we actually find in the characters. As to the serious function of instruction, which Thiafraster's no doubt aims to combine with that of entertainment, there is no more skillful mode of inducing moral betterment than the discovery and exposure of the ludicrous. Most men would rather incur the charge of immorality than be exposed to the belittling laugh or division of a community. They would rather be rugs than fools. The portrait painter of moral life makes use of the ludicrous when he desires to catch the popular attention, and there is nothing one may safely say that makes society at large prick up its ears and fall to gossiping so much as a satire in which some well-known person is subjected to ridicule. Moral folly is much the same everywhere. It is only the fools costume that changes in different countries. The folly of the miser is seen in his cheating himself of the real goods of life and enraving himself of the respect of his fellows. The folly of the coward in gaining personal safety by losing reputation for manliness. The folly of the flatterer in his shallow self-serving which men see through while they nudge their fellows and laugh at his weakness. The folly of the vain man in the way in which he assumes impressive proportions to his own magnifying eye while to others his personality looks as small as it is. The folly of the tactless man in consulting his own convenience rather than his neighbors, whereby he becomes a butt for his gouchary. The folly of the bull in his crampling awkwardly on the established uses of the polite world and thereby drawing upon himself the smilingly dericent attention of all observers. Throughout the list these characters represent some type of social foil or folly. In regard to the literary art of Thale Frostas as exhibited in these sketches it must be looked at from the standpoint of an innovation in Greek letters. It is rare that any man both begins and perfects an art. There is nothing in the world so interesting as a character but there is also nothing that is so difficult to portray briefly. Thale Frostas was an acute observer and he was a plain realist. His art consists in the truth fullness of his vision and in the direct simplicity with which he gives an expression. He does not seek to create a laugh by exaggeration or by the trick of a ludicrous situation that has no moral significance. His art is not possible without wit, keenness and fineness of feeling. There is no exhibition of the satirist lash but his criticism is made with that genealogy which is more telling than the severeest in fact. These are not individual portraits they lack therefore the detailed finish of such a portrait as is given in the much elaborated modern novel with its varied facilities for exhibiting the individuality of one or several persons. On the contrary these are merely outlined sketches as Thale Frostas himself calls them and are descriptive of a class not of an individual. A simple line however does not constitute a sketch to exhibit a character the sketch must not only be clear but complete. The coward E. G. is sketched in his fear at sea where his timid imagination invents dangers and he wishes to be put ashore. He is sketched on the field of battle where he tries to impress his comrades by a courage that he does not feel but when he hears the shouts of war and sees the soldiers fall he shrinks faint hearted to his tent and their searches for the sword he has himself hid. And again when the danger is over he resumes his bold exterior and proclaims his daring rescue of a comrade. We have here a pictorial sketch which with its life and action appeals to the reader's eye. The coward is shown from various points of view always in the new light but he is always the coward. The cannons of this species of literary art may be summarized as follows. One faithfulness to reality the character must be inaccurate report of nature and not a caricature it must be executed in the spirit of realism. Two, brevity, it must be slight and swift essentially of the nature of a sketch. Three, humor. It must have the sprightliness of statement that amuses while it instructs. Four, type. It must be illustrative of a generic or typical fault. In other words the character must give him body-munt to some folk that touches human nature in an essential and universal way. Five, concreteness. The fault as an abstraction must be translated by the artist's power into a concrete personal form. The foieble must be revealed in a genre picture of a living personality. Since Theo Frostis this form of character writing has been cultivated at various times but it flourished most amongst the minor essayist of the 17th century. It is of two slide in nature and itself to make a serious impression on any literary epic. It suited however the temper of the 17th century as the sprightly essay possessing no serious depth and aiming to touch life at many points. The chief imitators of Theo Frostis and exponents of character writing at this time were Bishop Hall, Bishop Earl, Sir Thomas Overebury, Nicholas Bretton, Samuel Butler, and La Brugher, Bishop Hall contrary to the example of Theo Frostis includes virtues as well as vices in his book entitled, Characters of Virtues and Vices, London, 1608. In the general structure of his composition he follows the model of Theo Frostis closely. In the description of vices however he is much more entertaining than in his sketches of virtues which are rather homalase and as the panagerics of a tedious preacher provoke one to yon. Virtue is not fitting material for this species of writing. The brilliant but ill-star, Dessert Thomas Overebury, in his character's or witty descriptions of the properties of sundry persons, London, 1614, went through 18 additions, departs from the usage of Theo Frostis in depicting for the most part, amusing accidents of character and humorous peculiarities of trades and professions. Bishop Earl, on the other hand, in his microcosmography, London, 1628, confined his character delineation to more days hominema to ethical types of men as such in a spirit similar to that of his Greek model. The best known of all the imitators of Theo Frostis if he can be called an imitator at all is La Brugher, in his L'A'Caractara's Ule-Muz, D'L'A'C'Ec'La, Paris 1688. The characters of La Brugher are really satiris on certain thinly disguised contemporaries of his own and are executed in a spirit and method totally different from that of Theo Frostis but the way to translation of the characters of Theo Frostis is added. La Brugher was a lover of the ancient classics although his translation or paraphrase was hardly more than a pretext for writing down his own description of the manners of his time. It furnished him perhaps the first suggestion and the first impulse to the portrayal of the vices and weaknesses of his contemporaries on a much larger scale than Theo Frostis had attempted. E. Pissultedicatory. Theo Frostis, too, Polyclis. Many a time air now I have stopped to think and wonder I fancy the Marvel will never grow less. Why it is that weak Greeks are not all one in character for we have the same climb at throughout the country and our people enjoy the same education. I have studied human nature a long time, my dear Polythis, where I have lived nine and ninety years. I have conversed with many men of diverse characters and have been at great pains to observe both good and bad. I have fancy therefore I opt to set down in writing how men live and act. I shall describe their characters each after it's kind and show you their besetting weaknesses. I dare say Polyclis, our children will be the better if we leave them memorials of this sort and as they study these patterns of good and ill they will elect I think to live and hold communion with men of the highest type. In this way they will strive to maintain the level of the highest. I turn now to my task. Yours it is to follow me and see if what I say is true. I begin my book with a description of the dissembler, omitting any preface and details about the word. And first of all I shall lay down a definition of dissembling and with this in view shall describe the datum blur in his character and manner of life exhibiting in such clearness as I can is various traits and of a preface and introductory material.","Psychology, Ancient",English,01:30:55,David Wales,"['Athenians', 'Greek', 'English', 'Trigidians', 'Lesbian', 'Rodian', 'Latin', 'Etruscan', 'Macedonian', 'Necomakian']","['Charles E.

Jonathan Harker's Journal. Kept in shorthand. Third May. Bistrets. Left me in no-goat. 835 pm on 1 May. Arriving at Vienna early next morning. Should have arrived at 646, but train was an hour-late. Budapest seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station as we had arrived late. And would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the west and entering the east. The most western of splendid bridges of the Dnub, which is here of noble width and depth. Took us among the traditions of Turkish rule. We left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to Klossenberg. Here I stopped for the night at the hotel Royale. I had for dinner or rather supper. I chickened up some way with red pepper, which was very good, but thirsty. Mamarandom get recipe for Mina. I asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika handle. And that as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere long the cup of Athens. I found my smattering of German very useful here. Indeed I don't know how I should be able to get on without it. Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania. It had struck me that some foreign knowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a noble man of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina. In the midst of the cup-haithian mountains, one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe, I was not able to light on any map or work, given the exact locality of the castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own ordinance survey maps. But I found that, bistris, the post-town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when I talk of my travels with Mina. In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities, Saxons in the south, and mixed with thumb the wallics who are descendants of the Dacians, Magios in the west, and Zikis in the east and north. I am going among the latter who claim to be descendant from the Tila and the Huns. This may be so for when the Magios conquered the country in the 11th century, they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered in the whole shoe of the copypins, as if it were the center of some sort of imaginative world pool. If so my stay may be very interesting. Mamarandon, I must ask the Count all about them. I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it, or may have been the paprika for I had to drink up all the water in my caraf, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was waken by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast, more paprika, and a sort of porridge of May's flower, which they said was, Mamaliga, an egg plant stuffed with force meat, a very excellent dish, which they call implotata. Memorandum, get recipe for this also. I had to hurry breakfast for the train started a little before 8, or rather at ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 730, I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go, the more unpunctual are the trains, would ought they to be in China. All day long we seemed to dwell to through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills, such as we do in old missiles. Sometimes we ran by rivers and streams, which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there are groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home, or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hearts and homemade trousers, but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waste. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petty coats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more Bob Berry in the rest, with the big cowboy hats and great baggy dirty white trousers, white linen shirts and enormous heavy leather belts. Nearly a foot wide, all started over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look pre-possessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands. Here they are, however, I am told very harmless and rather wanting a natural surface session. It was on the dark side of Twilight when we got to Bistraits, which is a very interesting, all-de-place, being practically on the frontier for the Wargo Pass leads from it into Bucovina. It has had a very stormy existence and certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made it terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the 17th century, it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of War proper being assisted by famine and disease. Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Cron Hotel, which I found to my great delight to be thoroughly old-fashioned. For of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected for when I got near the door I faced a cherry-looking elderly woman in the usual present dress, white undergarment with long double apron, front and back of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight from modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, the hair Englishman. Yes I said, Jonathan Harker. She smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirts thieves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with the letter. My friend, welcome to the Carpathians, I am anxiously expecting you. Sleep well tonight, a three tomorrow the diligence will start for Bucovina. A place on it is kept for you, at the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land, your friend Dracula. For me, I found that my landlord had got a letter from the count, directing him to secure the best place in the coach for me, but on making inquiries as to the details he seemed somewhat ratisant, and pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be true because up till then he had understood it perfectly, at least he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way, he mummled out the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife cross themselves, and saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time I've started that I had no time to ask anyone else, but it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting. Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way, must you go, oh young hair must you go, she was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost a grip of what German she knew, and mixed sit up with some other language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions, when I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business she asked a gun, do you know what day it is? I answered that it was the fourth of me, she shook her head and she said again, oh yes I know that I know that, but do you know what day it is? On my saying that I did not understand she went on. It is the eve of St. George's Day, do not know that tonight, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway, do not know where you are going and what you are going to. She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect, finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go, at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous, but I did not feel comfortable. However there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up and said as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do for as an English churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as, in some other, a doletrus. And yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse all lady, meaning so well, and in such a state of mind. She saw her as opposed the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round by neck, and said, for your mother's sake, and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late. And the crucifix is still round by neck, whether it is the old lady's fear or the many ghostly traditions of this place or the crucifix itself. I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should have a rich meaning before I do, let it bring my goodby. Here comes the coach. Five and May, the castle. The grave of the morning has passed and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not for it is, so far off that big things and little are mixed. I am not sleepy, and as I am not to be called to lie awake, naturally I write, till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down, and less to read than my fancy I dined too well before I left a bistris. Let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called, robrostake. Bits of bacon, onion and beef seasoned with red pepper, and strong on sticks and roasted over the fire, in a simple style of the London Cards' meat. The wine was golden medias, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only couple glasses of this and nothing else. When I got on the coach, their driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the land lady. They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then. They looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door, which they called by a name, meaning word bear, came in listened. And then looked at me, most of them, pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say, they were not cheering to me for months to them, were, or dog, satin, pocus, hell, stragoyca, which, rollock, and lukkosluck, both of which mean the same thing, one being slow back and the other, serving, for something that is either, well-wulf or vampire. Memorandum, I must ask the count about these superstitions. When we started, the crowd ran the indoor, which had by this time, swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant. He would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me. Just starting for an unknown place, to meet an unknown man, but everyone seemed so kind-hearted, so sorrowful, so sympathetic, that I could not be but touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inyard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves that they stood round with a wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of all the anderned orange trees, in green tubs clustered, in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box seat, got so they called him, cracked his big whip over his force-mile horses, which ran a breast and we set off on our journey. I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although I had known the language or rather languages, which very fellow passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere the wilderness mass of fruit blossom, apple plum pear cherry, and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the middle land, ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, always shut out by the struggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo pruned. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Copaivians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept into good order. Of all to the hosped hours would not repair them, less the Turks should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point. Beyond the green swelling hills of the middle land, rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steepes of the Copaivians themselves. Right in left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks. Green and brown were grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed craigs, till these were themselves lost in the distance, with a snowy peaks rose groundly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept around the base of the hill, and opened up the lofty snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us. Look, each didn't sit, God's seat, and he crossed himself reverently, as we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasized by the fact that the snowy mountain tops still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Jackson's Wilvax, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that Goyta was painfully prevalent. By the roadside there were many crosses, and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me, for instance, hey, ricks in the trees, here and there, very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leader wagon, the ordinary peasant's cart, with its long snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were shared to be seated quite a group of homecoming pezans, the checks with their white and the slow vax with their colored sheep skins, the latter carrying landsfash in their long staves with ax at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistyness, the gloom of the trees oak beach and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the past. The dark furs stood out here and there against the background of late-langs snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of grain is which here and there up is through the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies in gendered earlier in the evening. When the falling sunset threw into a strange relief that ghost-like clouds which amongst the cappetians seemed to wind sea-slicely through the valleys, sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our drivers' haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. No, no, he said, and you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce, and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim plysentry, for he looked round to catch the proving smile of the rest, and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep. The only stop you would make was a moment's pause to light his lamps. When it grew dark, there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him one after the other, as though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmasfully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement, urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though they were cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater, the crazy coat rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on, the road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come near to us on each side, and a frown down upon us. We were entering on the borego pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial. These were certainly even ardent varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistrets. The sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, it on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, paired eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time, and at last we saw before us, the pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark rolling clouds over head, and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmosphere's, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness, but always dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in white cloud. We could see now the sandy road line white before us, but there was on it, no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best to do when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear. It was spoken so quietly and so low atone. I thought it was an hour less than the time. Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own. There is no carriage here, the hair is not expected after all. He will now come on to Bucovina and return tomorrow all the next day, better the next day. Whilst he was speaking, the horses began to nae and snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up. Then amongst the course of screams from the peasants and the universal crossing of themselves, a collet with four horses drove up behind us, over took us and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were called black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man with a long, brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight as he turned to us. He said to the driver, you are early tonight, my friend, the man's dam at an reply, the English hair was in a hurry to which the stranger replied, that is why I suppose you wished him to go on to Bucovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend, I know too much, and my horses are swift. As he spoke, he smiled and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Bucovina's linole, then they thought in the light and shnel, for the dead travel fast. The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. Give me the house luggage, said the driver, and with exceeding a lacquerity, my bags were handed out and put into the collet. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the collet was close alongside the driver helping me with a hand, which caught my arm in a grip of steel, whose strength must have been prodigious. Without a word, he shook his reins and the horses turned and reswept into the darkness of the past. As I looked back, I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it, the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on the way to Bucovina. As they sank into the darkness, I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me, but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders and a rug crossed my knees, and the driver said in excellent German, the night is chill mine here, and my master the count made me take all care of you. There are the flask of slivovits, the plumb band of the country, underneath the seat, if you should require it. I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a little strangely and not a little frightened. I think, had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn, and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again, and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect, in case there had been an intention to delay. By and by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a march, and by its flame looked at my watch, it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense. Then a dog began to holl somewhere in a farmhouse down the road, along egg-enized wailing as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another till, born on the wind which now sides softly through the past, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first how, the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling, that of wolves, which affected both the horses and myself in the same way, for I was minded to jump from the colletion run, whilst they rear to again and plunged madly so that the driver had used all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes however my own ears got accustomed to the sound and the horses so far became quiet, that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He patted and suathed them and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses there became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace. This time after going to the far side of the pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right. Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway to a past as through a tunnel, and again, great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side, though we were in shelter we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and wistled through the rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all round us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way, the bang of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer as though they were closing round the roadway. A grew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed, he kept turning his head left to right, but I could not see anything through the darkness. Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment, he had once checked the horses and jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer, but while I wondered, the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took a seat and re-resumed a journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose. It must have been very faint for it did not seem to loom in the place around it at all, gathering few stones, from them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect, when he stood between me and the flame, he did not obstruct it, for I could see it's ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary I took it that my eyes deceived me, straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames and we spread onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us as though they were following in a moving circle. At last there came a time when the driver went further field than he had gone yet, and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and are snort and screen with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether, but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a beatling pine-clad rock. And by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinew-e limbs and shaggy hair. There were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they held. For myself I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors than he can understand the true import. All at once the wolves began to hurl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in every way painful to see, but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side, and they had perforced to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try and break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the clove, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give them a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway, as he swept his long arms. As though brushing his sides am impalpable obstacle, the wolves felt back, and back further still. Just done, a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness. When I could see again the driver was climbing into the collet, and the wolves had disappeared. This was also strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminimbed as we swept on our way, now an almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line across the moon that sky.

It was a big, coffin-shaped plywood box that looked like it waited ton. This brawny type just dumped it through the door of the police station and started away. I looked up from the blotter and shouted at the trucker's vanishing back. What the hell is that? How should I know he said is he swung up into the cab? I just delivered. I don't act for him. He came on the morning rocket firm Earth is all I know. He gunned the truck more than he had to and threw up a billowing cloud of red dust. Jokers had growled in myself. Mars is full of jokers. When I went over to look at the box, I could feel the dust great between my teeth. Chief Craig must have heard the racket because he came out of his office and helped me stand and look at the box. I think it's a bomb he asked in a board voice. Why would anyone bother? Particularly with a thing this size. And all away from Earth. He knouted agreement and walked around to look at the other end. There was no sender as address anywhere on the outside. Finally, we had to dig out the crowbar and I went to work on the top. After some prying it pulled free and fell off. That was when we had our first look at Ned. We all would have been a lot happier if it had been our last look as well. If we had just put the lid back on and shipped the thing back to Earth, I now know what they mean about Pandora's box. But we just stood there and stared like a couple of robes. Ned lay motionless and stared back at us. A robot that Chief said, fairy observant is easy to see you went to the police academy. Ha ha, now find out what he's doing here. I hadn't gone to the academy. But this was no handy cap to my finding the letter. It was sticking up out of a thick book in a pocket in the box. The Chief took the letter and read it with a little enthusiasm. Well, well, United Robotics have the brain stormed. Robotics correctly used will tend to provide invaluable in police work. They wanted to cooperate in a field test. Robotics closed is the latest experimental model by U220,000 credits. We both looked back at the robot, sharing the wish that the credits had been in the box instead of a bit. The Chief found and moved his lips through the rest of the letter. I wondered how we got the robot out of its plywood coffin. Experimental model or not, this was a nice looking hunk of machinery. A uniform navy blue all over, though the outlet cases, hooks and such were a metallic gold. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to get that effect. This was as close as a robot could look to a cop in uniform without being a joke. All that seemed to be missing was the badge and gun. Then I noticed the tiny glow of light in the robot's islands is. It had never occurred to me before that the thing might be turned on. It was nothing to lose by finding out. Get out of that box, I said. The robot came up smooth and fast as a rocket, landing two feet in front of me and whipping out a snappy salute. Police experimental robot serial number XPO456934B reporting for duty sir. His voice quivered with alertness and I could almost hear the humming of those Todd cable muscles. He may have had a stainless steel hide and a bunch of wires for a brain, but he spelled rookie cop to me just the same. The fact that he was man-hight with two arms, two legs, and that painted on uniform helped. All I had to do was squint my eyes a bit and there stood Ned the rookie cop. Fresh out of school and raring to go. I shook my head to get rid of the illusion. This was just six feet of machine that boffins and brain boys had turned out for their own amusement. Relax, Ned, I said. He was still holding the salute. Eddies, you'll get our herni of your exhaust pipe a few states of tense. Anyways, I'm just the sergeant here. That's the chief of police over there. Ned didn't about face and slid over to the chief with that same grease lightning motion. The chief just looked at him like something that sprang out from under the hood of a car, while Ned went through the same report routine. I wonder if it does anything else besides salute and report. The chief said, while he walked around the robot, looking it over like a dog with a hydrant. The functions, operations, and responsible courses of action, open to the police, experimental robots, are outlined on pages 184-213 of the manual. Ned's voice was muffled for a second while he half-dive back into his case and came up with the volume mentioned. A detailed breakdown of these will also be found on pages 1,035-1,267 inclusive. The chief who has trouble reading an entire comic page at one sitting turned the sixth-inch thick book over in his hands like it would maybe bite him. When he had a rough idea of how much it weighed and a good feel of the binding he threw it on my desk, take care of this he said to me as he headed towards his office and the robot to do something with it. The chief span of attention never was great and it had been strained in the limit this time. I flipped through the book, wondering, one thing I never have had much to do with his robots, so I know just as much about them as any Jill in the street, probably less. The book was filled with pages of fine print, fancy mathematics, wiring diagrams and charts in nine colors, and that kind of thing. It needed close attention, which attention I was not prepared to give at the time. The book's lid shut and I eyed the newest employee of the City of Nine Port. There is a broom behind the door. Do you know how to use it? Yes sir. In that case, you will sweep out this room, raising a small cloud of dust as possible at the same time. He did a very neat job of it. I watched 120,000 credits worth of machinery making a tidy pile of butts and sand and wonder why it had been sent to Nine Port. Probably because there wasn't another police force in the solar system that was smaller or more unimportant than ours. The engineers must have figured this would be a good spot for a field test. Even if the thing blew up, nobody would really mind. There would probably be someone along some day to get a rapport on it. Well, they had picked their right spot all right. Nine Port was just a little bit beyond nowhere. Which of course was why I was there? I was the only real cop on the force. We needed at least one to give an illusion of the wheels going round. The chief, Alonzo Craig, had just enough sense to take graft without dropping the money. There were two patrolmen, one old and drunk most of the time. The other so young the only scar he had was the mark of the atrium. I had ten years on a metropolitan force, earthside. Why I left is nobody's damn business. I have long since paid for any mistakes I made there by ending up a nine port. Nine port is not a city. It's just a place where people stop. The only permanent citizens are the ones who cater to those on the way through hotel keepers, restaurant owners, gamblers, bar keeps and the rest. There is a space port, but only some freighters come there to pick up the metal from some of the mines that are still working. Some of the settlers still came in for supplies. You might say that nine port was a town that just missed the boat. In a hundred years I doubt if there will be enough left sticking out of the sand to tell where it used to be. I won't be there either, so I couldn't care less. I went back to the blotter. Five drunks in the tank, an average night's hall, while I wrote them up, fats dragged in the sixth one. Gimself in the ladies' John at the space port and resisting arrest he reported. D&D, thromin with the rest. Fat steered his limp victim across the floor, matching him step for dragging step. I always marveled that the way fats took care of the drunks, since he usually had more under his belt than they had. I have never seen him falling down drunk or completely sober. Now at all he was good for was keeping the blurred eye on the lock up and running in drunks. He did well at that. No matter what they crawled under or on top of, he found them. No doubt due to the same shared natural instincts. Fat's clang the door behind number six and weaved his way back in. What's that he asked, pairing at the robot along the purple beauty of his nose? That is a robot. I have forgotten the number his mother gave him a factory so we will call him Ned. He works here now. Good for him, he can clean up the tank after we throw the bums out. That's my job, Billy said, coming in through the front door. He clutched his nightstick and scowled out from under the brim of his uniform cap. It is not that Billy is stupid, just that most of his strength is gone into his back instead of his mind. That's Ned's job now because you have a promotion. You are going to help me with some of my work. Billy came in very handy at times and I was anxious that the force shouldn't lose him. My explanation cheered him because he sat down by fats and watched Ned do the floor. That's the way things went for about a week. We watched Ned sweep and polish until the station began to take on a positively antiseptic look. With a chief who always has an eye out for that type of thing, found out that Ned could file the odd ton of reports and paperwork that cluttered his office. All this kept the robot busy and we got so used to him we were hardly aware he was around. I knew he had moved the packing case into the store room and fixed himself up a cozy sort of robot dormitory coffin. Other than that I didn't know or care. The operation manual was buried in my desk and I never looked at it. If I had, I might have had some idea of the big changes that were in store. None of us knew the littlest bit about what a robot can or cannot do. Ned was working nicely as a combination janitor file clerk and should have stayed that way. He would have too if the chief hadn't been so lazy. That's what started at all. It was around 9 at night and the chief was just going home when they call came in. He took it. Listen for a moment, then hung up. Greenback's liquor store, he got held up again, says to come at once. That's a change. Usually we don't hear about it until a month later. What's he paying protection money for if China generate protecting? What's the rush now? The chief chewed his loose lip for a while. Finally and painfully reached a decision. He better go around and see what the trouble is. Sure I said reaching for my cap, but no one else is around. You'll have to watch the desk until I get back. That's no goody moan. I'm dying from hunger and sitting here isn't going to help me any. I will go take the report and it said stepping forward and snapping his usual well-greased salute. At first the chief wasn't buying. You would think the water cooler came to life and offered to take over his job. How could you take a report? He growled, putting the wise guy water cooler at the place. But he had phrased his little insult as a question so he had only himself to blame. In exactly three minutes, Ned gave the chief a summary of the routine necessary for police officer to make a report on an armed robbery or other reported theft. From the glaze looking chiefs protruding eyes, I could tell Ned had quickly passed the boundaries of the chief's meager knowledge. Enough, the Harriet man had finally gasped. If you know so much, why don't you make a report? Which to me sounded like another version of if you're so damn smart, why ain't you rich, which we used to snarl that the Braini kids in grammar school? Ned took such things literally though and turned towards the door. Do you mean you wish me to make a report on this robbery? Yes, the chief said, just to get rid of him. He watched his blue-shaped vanish through the door. He must be right or than he looks, I said. He never stopped to ask where Greenback's store is. The chief nodded in the phone rang again. His hand was still resting on it so he picked it up by reflex. He listened for a second and he would have thought someone was pumping blood out of his heel from the way his face turned white. The hold-up still on he finally gasped. Greenback's delivery boy is on the line calling back to see where we are. He says he's under table in the back room. I never heard the rest of it because I was out the door and into the car. There were a hundred things that could happen if Ned got there before me. Guns could go off. People hurt lots of things. And the police would be to blame for it all, sending a chin robot to do a cops job. Maybe the chief had ordered Ned there, but clearly as if the words were painted on the windshield of the car, I knew I would be dragged into it. It never gets very warm on Mars, but I was sweating. Nine port has fourteen traffic regulations and I broke all of them before I had gone in block. Fast as I was, Ned was faster. As I turn the corner, I saw him open the door of Greenback's store and walk in. I screamed breaks in behind him and arrived just in time to have a gallery seat, a shooting gallery at that. There were two holes uppunks, one behind the counter making like a clerk and the other launching off to the side. Their guns were out of sight, but blue-coded Ned busting through the door like that was too much for their keyed-up nerves. Up came both guns like they were on strings and Ned stopped dead. I grabbed for my own gun and waited for pieces of bustered robot to come flying through the window. Ned's reflexes were great, which I suppose is what she should expect of a robot. Up your guns, you are under arrest. He must have had on full power or something. His voice blasted slow allowed my ears hurt. The result was just what you might expect. Both torpedoes let go at once and the air was filled with flying slugs. The show windows went out with a crash and I went down on my stomach. From the amount of noise I knew they both had recoil at 50 calibers. You can't stop one of those slugs. They go right through you and anything else that happens to be in the way. Except they didn't seem to be bothering Ned. The only notice he seemed to take was to cover his eyes. A little shield with a thin slit popped down over his islands. Then he moved in on the first thug. I knew he was fast, but not that fast. A couple of slugs jarred him as he came across the room, but before the punk could change his aim, Ned had the gun in his hand. That was the end of that. He put on one of the sweetest hammer locks I have ever seen and neatly grabbed the gun when it dropped from the limp fingers. With the same motion that slipped the gun into a pouch, he whipped out a pair of handcuffs and snapped them on the punk's wrists. Hold up, Nick number two, was heading for the door by then, and I was waiting to give him a warm reception. There was never any need. He hadn't gone halfway before Ned slid in front of him. There was a thud when they hit that didn't even shake Ned, but gave the other a glazed look. He never even knew it when Ned slipped the cuffs on him and dropped him down next to his partner. I went in, took their guns from Ned, and made the arrest official. That was all Greenback saw when he crawled out from behind the counter, and it was all I wanted him to see. The place was a foot deep and broken glass and smelled like the inside of a jacked Daniel's bottle. Greenback began to howl like a wolf over his lost stock. He didn't seem to know any more about the phone calls than I did, so I grabbed a hold of a pimple looking kid who staggered out of the store room. He was the one who had made the calls. It turned out to be a matter of sheer stupidity. He had worked for Greenback only a few days and didn't have enough brains to realize that all holdups should be reported to the protection boys instead of the police. I told the Greenback to wise up his boy as to look at the trouble that got caused. Then pushed the two X holdup made out to the car. Ned climbed in back with them, and they clung together like two waves in a storm. The robot's only response was to pull a first aid kit from his hip and fix up a ricochet hole in one of the thugs that no one else had noticed in the excitement. The chief was still sitting there with that bloodless look when we marched in. I didn't believe it could be done, but he went too shade wider. You made the pinch he whispered. Before I could straighten him out a second and more awful idea hit him. He grabbed the handful of shirt on the first torpedo and poked his face down. He was with China Joe, he snorled. The punk made the air of trying to be cute so the chief led him have one on the head with the open hand that said his eyes rolling like marbles. When the question got asked again, he found the right answer. I never heard from no China Joe. We just hit town today and freelance by the chief side and collapsed into his chair. Lock him up and quickly tell me what in hell happened. I slammed the gate on them and pointed a none-to-steady finger at Ned. There is the hero I said. Took them on single-handed, rassled them for a fall and made the capture. He is one robot tornado, a power for good in this otherwise evil community. And he's bulletproof too. I ran a finger over Ned's broad chest. The paint was chipped by the slugs, but the metal was hardly scratched. This is going to cause me trouble. They had trouble the chief wailed. I knew he meant with the protection boys. They did not like punk's getting arrested and guns going off without their okay. But Ned thought the chief had other worries and rushed in to put them right. There will be no trouble. At no time did I violate any of the robotic restriction laws. They are part of my control circuits and therefore flay automatic. The men who drew their guns violated both robotic and human law when they threatened violence, I did not injure the men, merely restrained them. It was all over the chief's head, but I like to think I could follow it. And I had been wondering how robot a machine could be involved in something like law application in violence. Ned had the answer to that one too. Robots have been assuming these functions for years. Don't recording radar meters past judgment on human violation of automobile regulations. A robot alcohol detector is better qualified to assess the sobriety of a prisoner than the arresting officer. At one time robots were even allowed to make their own decisions about killing. Before the robotic restriction laws, automatic gun pointers were in general use. Their final development was a self-contained battery of large anti aircraft guns. Automatic scan radar detected all aircraft in the vicinity. Those that could not return the correct identifying signal had their courses tracked and computed automatic fuse cutters and loaders ready to computer aimed guns, which were fired by the robot mechanism. There was a little like an argue about with Ned, except maybe his college professor vocabulari. So I switched the attack. But a robot can't take the place of a cop. It's a complex human job. Of course it is, but taking a human policeman's place is not the function of a police robot. Primarily, I combine the functions of numerous pieces of police equipment integrating their operations and making them instantly available. In addition, I can aid in the mechanical processes of law enforcement. If you arrest a man, you handcuff him. But if you order me to do it, I have made no moral decision. I am just a machine for attaching handcuffs at that point. My raised hand cut off the flow of robotic argument. Ned was hit to his ears with facts and figures, and I had a good idea who would come off second best in any continued discussion. No laws had been broken when Ned made the pinch. That was for sure. But there are other laws than those that appear on the books. China Joe is not going to like this, not at all the chief said, speaking my own thoughts. The law of tooth and claw. That's one that was an in the law books. And that was what ran nine port. The place was just big enough to have a good population of gambling joints, body houses, and drunk rollers. They were all run by China Joe. As was the police department, we were all in his pocket, and you might say he was the one who paid our wages. This is not the kind of thing though that you explained to a robot. Yeah, China Joe. I thought it was an echo at first, then realized that someone had eased in the door behind me. Something called Alex, six feet of bone, muscle, and trouble. China Joe's right hand man. He imitated a smile at the chief who sank a bit lower in his chair. China Joe wants you to tell him why you got smart cops going around and putting the arm on people and letting them shoot up good liquor. He's mostly angry about the hooch. He says that you have enough guff and after this you should. I am putting you under robot arrest, pursuant to article 46, paragraph 19 of the revised statutes. He was arresting Alex and signing our death. Alex was not slow. As he turned to see who had grabbed him, he had already dragged out his cannon. He got one shot in, square against Ned's chest, before the robot plucked the gun away and slipped on the cuffs. While we all gaped like dead fish, Ned recited the church in what I swear was a satisfied tone. The prisoner is Peter Ratjomsky, alias Alex the ex wanted in canal city for armed robbery and attempted murder. Also wanted by local police of Detroit, New York and Manchester on charges of get it off May, Alex howled. We might have, too, and everything might have still been straightened out if Benny Bug had in her the shot. He popped his head in the front door just long enough to roll his eyes over our little scene. Alex, they're putting the arm on Alex. Then he was gone and when I hit the door he was nowhere in sight. Trying to jose boys always went around in pairs and in ten minutes he would know all about it. Book him, I told Ned, it wouldn't make any difference if we let him go now. The world has already come to an end. That's came in then, mumbling to himself. He jerked a thumb over his shoulder when he saw me. What's up, I see little Benny Bug come out here like the place was on fire and almost get killed driving away. Then fat saw Alex with the bracelet on and turns sober in one second. He just took a moment to gap then his mind was made up. Without a trace of a stagger he walked over to the chief and threw his badge on the desk in front of him. I am an old man and I drink too much to be a cop. Therefore I am resigning from the force because if that is who my think it is over there with the cuff son, I will not live to be a day older as long as I am around here. Rat, the chief growled and pained through his clenched teeth, deserting the sinking ship. Rat. Squeak, fat said and left. The chief was beyond caring at this point. He didn't blink an eye when I took fat's as bad, I don't know why I did it. Perhaps I thought it was only fair. Ned had started all the trouble and I was just angry enough to want him on the spot when it was finished. There were two rings on his chest plate and I was not surprised when the badge being fitted them neatly. There. Now you look like a real cop. Sarcasm dripped from the words, I should have realized that robots are immune to sarcasm. Ned took my statement at face value. This is a very great honor not only for me but for all robots, I will do my best to fulfill all the obligations of the office. Had to act arms strong and tin on the wear. I could hear the little motors than his guts humming with joy as he booked Alex. If everything else hadn't been so bad I would have enjoyed that. Ned had more police equipment built into him than nine board had ever owned. There was an ink pad that snapped out of one hip and he officially rolled Alex's fingertips across it and stamped him on a card. Then he held the prisoner at arms length while something clicked in his abdomen. One more sideways and two instant photographs strapped out of a slot. The mug shots were stuck on the card, arrest details and such inserted. There was more like this but I forced myself away. There were more important things to think about, like staying alive. Any ideas chief? A grown was my only answer so I let it go with that. Billy, the balance of the police force came in and gave him a quick rundown. He threw stupidity or guts he elected to stay and I was proud of the boy. Ned locked away the latest prisoner and began sweeping up. That was the way we were when China joked. Even though we were expecting it, it was still a shock. He had a bunch of his toughest hoods with him and they crowded through the door like an overweight baseball team. China joked was in front, hands buried in the sleeves of his long Mandarin gown. No expression at all on his aesthetic features. He didn't waste time talking to us, just gave the word to his own boys. Clean this place up. The new police chief will be here in a while and I don't want him to see any bombs hanging around. It made me angry, even with the graft I'd like to feel I'm still a cop, not on a cheap punk's payroll. I was also curious about China Joe. Had been ever since I tried to get a line on him and never found a thing, I still wanted to know. He said, take a good look at that Chinese guy in the round bathroom and let me know who he is. My but those electronics circuits work fast. Ned Shutti answered back like a straight man who had been rehearsing his lines for weeks. He is a pseudo-oriental utilizing a natural salonist of the skin heightened with guy. He is not Chinese. There has also been an operation on his eyes, scars of which are still visible. This has been undoubtedly done in an attempt to conceal his real identity, but Bertilian measurements of his ears and other features make identity positive. He is on the very wanted list of interpol and his real name is China Joe was angry and with a reason. That's the thing that Big Mouse 10 radio said over there. We heard about it and we're taking care of it. The mob jumped aside then or hit the deck and I saw there was a guy kneeling in the door with a rocket launcher. Shaped anti-tank charges no doubt. That was my last thought as the thing let go with a wush. Maybe you can hit a tank with one of those but not a robot. At least not a police robot. Ned was sliding across the floor on his face when the back wall blew up. There was no second shot. Ned closed his hand on the tube of the bazooka and it was so much old drain pipe. He really decided that anyone who fired a rocket in a police station was breaking in the law so he moved in with his club. I was right behind him since I didn't want to miss any of the fun. Ned was at the bottom somewhere but he didn't doubt he could take care of himself. There were a couple of muffled shots and someone screamed. No one fired after that because we were too tangled up. A punk named Brooklyn Eddie hit me on the side of the head with his gun but and I broke his nose all over his face with my fist. There's a kind of fog over everything after that but I do remember it was very busy for a while. When the fog lifted a bit I realized I was the only ones still standing or leaning rather. It was a good thing the wall was there. Ned came in through the street door carrying a very bashed looking Brooklyn Eddie. I hoped I had done all that. Eddie's wrists were fastened together with cuffs. Ned laid him gently next to the heap of thugs who I suddenly realized all were the same kind of handcuffs. I wondered vaguely if Ned made them as he needed them or had a supply tucked away in a hollow leg or something. There was a chair a few feet away and sitting down helped. Blood was all over everything and if a couple of the hoods hadn't grown I would have thought they were corpses. One was I noticed suddenly a bullet had caught him in the chest most of the blood was probably his. Ned burrowed in the bodies for a moment and dragged Billy out. He was unconscious, a big smile on his face and the splintered remains of his night sticks still stuck in his fist. It takes very little to make some people happy. A bullet had gone through his leg and he never moved while Ned ripped the pants like off and put on a bandage. The spurious China Joe and one other man escaped in a car and had reported. Don't let it worry you I managed to croak. Your batting average still leads the league. It was then I realized the chief was still sitting in his chair where he had been when the bruhahah started. It was then I realized the chief was still sitting in his chair where he had been when the bruhahahah started. Still slumped down with that glazed look. Only after I started to talk to him did I realized it alone so Craig. Chief of Police of Nine Port was now dead. A single shot. Small caliber gun, maybe a 22. Right through the heart and what blood there was had been soaked up by his clothes. I had a good idea where the gun would be that fired that shot a small gun. The kind that would fit in a wide Chinese sleeve. I wasn't tired or cragly anymore. Just angry. Maybe he hadn't been the brightest or most honest guy in the world. But he deserved a better end than that, knocked off by a two-bit racket boss who thought he was being crossed. Right about then I realized I had a big decision to make. With Billy out of the fight and fats gone I was the nine port police force. While I had to do to be clear of this mess was to walk out the door and keep going, I would be safe enough. Ned buzzed by, picked up two of the thugs and hauled them off to the cells. Maybe it was the sight of his blue back or maybe I was tired of running. Either way my mind was made up before I realized it. I carefully took off the Chief's gold badge and put it on in place of my old one. The new Chief of Police of Nine Port I said to no one in particular. Yes sir, Ned said it as he passed. He put one of the prisoners down long enough to salute and went on with his work. I returned the salute. The hospital meat wagon hauled away the dead wounded. I took an evil pleasure in ignoring the questioning stairs of the attendance. After the dock fixed the side of my head, everyone cleared out. Ned mopped up the floor. I ate ten aspirin and waited for the hammering to stop so I could think of what to do next. When I pulled my thoughts together, the answer was obvious. Too obvious. I made as long a job as I could for loading my gun. Refill your handcuff box, Ned. We're going out. Like a good cop, he asked no questions. I locked the outside door when we laughed and gave him the key. Here, there's a good chance you will be the only one left to use this before the day is over. I stretched the drive over to China Joe's place just as much as I could. Trying to figure if there was another way of doing it, there wasn't murder had been done. And Joe was the boy I was going to pin it on, so I had to get him. The best I could do was stop around the corner and give Ned a briefing. This combination bar and dice room is the sole property of he whom we shall still call China Joe until there is time for you to give me a run down I'm right now I got enough distractions. What we have to do is go in there, find Joe and bring him to justice. No simple, Ned answered in his sharp Joe college voice, but wouldn't it be simpler to make the arrest now when he is leaving in that car instead of waiting until he returns? The car I mentioned was doing 60 as it came out of the alley ahead of us. I only had a glimpse of Joe in the back seat as it tore by us. Stopped them I shouted mostly for my own benefit since I was driving. I tried to shift gears and start the engine at the same time and succeeded in doing exactly nothing. No Ned stopped them, it had been phrased as an order. He leaned his head out of the window and I saw it once why most of his equipment was located in his torso, probably his brain as well. The sure wasn't much room left in his head when that cannon was tucked away in there. A 75 caliber recoilless, a plate swivel back right where his nose should have been if he had had one and the big muzzle pointed out. It's a neat idea when you think about it. Right between the eyes for good aiming, up high, always ready. The boom boom almost took my head off. Of course Ned was a perfect shot, so would I be with a computer for a brain. He had hold one rare tire with each slug and the car flap flap to a stop a little ways down the road. I climbed out slowly while Ned sprinted there in seconds flat. They didn't even try to run this time. What little nerve they had left must have been shattered by the smoking muzzle of that 75 caliber poking out from between net eyes. Robots are neat about things like that, so he must have left it sticking out to a liberate. Probably had a course in psychology back in robot school. Three of them in the car, all waiting their hands in the air like the last real of a western, and the rear floor covered with interesting little suitcases. Everyone came along quietly. Trying to joe only snorled while Ned told me that his name really was Stanton, and the Almyra hot seat was kept warm all the time and hopes he would be back. I promised joe, Stanton I would be happy to arrange it that same day. Thereby not worrying about any slipups with the local authorities, the rest of the mob would stand trial on Canal City. It was a very busy day. Things have quieted down a good deal since then. Billy is out of the hospital and wearing my old sergeant stripes. One fat says back, though he is sober once in a while now, and has trouble looking me in the eye. We don't have much to do because in addition to being a quiet town, this is known honest one. Ned is on foot patrol nights, and in charge of the lab in filestays. Maybe the policeman's benevolent wouldn't like that, but Ned doesn't seem to mind. He touched up all the bullet scratches and keeps his badge polished. I know a robot can't be happy or sad, but Ned seems to be happy. Sometimes that would swear I can hear him humming to himself, but of course that is only the motors and things going around. When you start thinking about it, I suppose we set some kind of precedent here, what with putting on a robot is a full-fledged police officer. Now, whenever came around from the factory yet, so I have never found out if we're the first or not. And I'll tell you something else. I'm not going to stay in this broken downtown forever. I have some letters out now, looking for a new job. Some people are going to be very surprised when they see who their new chief of police is after I leave. Kind of arm of the law.","Science Fiction, Fantasy Fiction, Anthologies",English,07:28:46,LibriVox Volunteers,"['Chinese', 'Harriet', 'polish', 'Bertilian']","['joe', 'Ned', 'Joe', 'Brooklyn Eddie', 'Peter Ratjomsky', 'Eddie', 'Jill', 'Billy', 'Ned Shutti', ""Brian Dirk's"", 'Alex', 'Greenback', 'Stanton', 'Todd', 'Benny Bug', 'Craig', 'Harry Harrison', 'Alonzo Craig', 'Nick', 'mug']","['Canal City', 'China', 'Detroit', 'Braini', 'New York']","['Mars', 'Earth']",1,1,2,0,18,0,0

For more information or to volunteer, please visit LibriVox.org, recording by Nisleyhan Stumboli. The Christmas Goblins. In an old Abitown, a long, long while ago, they were officiated as a sexton and grave degree in the churchyard, one Gabriel Graham. He was an ill-conditioned cross-grained, serly fellow, who consulted with nobody but himself, and an old wicker bottle which fitted into his large, deep, waste-coated pocket. A little before trial-ite one Christmas Eve, Gabriel showed that his spade lighted as lantern, and beatook himself toward the old churchyard, who had a grave to finish by next morning. And feeling very low, he sought it my traces, spirits perhaps, if he went on with his work at once. He strayed along until he turned into the dark lane, which led to the churchyard, a nice gloomy, mournful place into which the townspeople did not catch a girl, except in broad daylight. Consequently, he was not a little indignant to hear a young urchin, roaring at some jolly song about a merry Christmas. Gabriel waited until the boy came up, then wrapped him over the head with his lantern, five for six times, to teach him to modulate his voice. And as the boy hurried away, with his hand to his head, Gabriel grabbed chuckle-tum-sulf, and entered the churchyard, locking the gate behind him. He took off his couch, put down his lantern, and getting into an unfinished grave, worked at it for an hour or so with right good will. But the earth was hardened with the frost, and it was no easy matter to break it up and shovel it out. At any other time, this would have made Gabriel very miserable, but he was so pleased that having stopped the small boy singing, that he took little heed of the scanty progress he had made, when he had finished work for the night, and looked down into the grave with a grim satisfaction, murmuring as he gathered up his things. Brave lodgings for one. Brave lodgings for one. A few feet of cold earths when life is done. Ha ha ha ha ha. He laughed, as he set himself down on a flat tombstone, which was a favorite resting place of his, and drew forth his wikobottle. A coffin and Christmas. A Christmas box. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Repeated a voice closed beside him. It was the echoes. Said he, raising the bottle to his lips again. It was not. Said a deep voice. Gabriel started up and stood rooted to the spot with terror. For his eyes rested on a form that made his blood run cold. Seated on an upright tombstone close to him, was a strange, unerftly figure. He was sitting perfectly still, ruining it Gabriel's grob with such a grin as only a gobbling of cola. What do you hear on Christmas Eve? Said the gobbling Stanley. Ha ha ha ha. I came to the grave, sir. Stammed, Gabriel. What man wonders among graves on such anight as this? Cried the gobbling. Gabriel, gobbling. Gabriel, gobbling. Screamed a wild chorus of voices that seemed to fill the churchyard. What have you got in that bottle? Said the gobbling. Ha ha ha. Ha ha. Reply the sexton, trembling more than ever, for he had bought it of the smugglers. And he thought his question, in the excised department of the goblins. Who brings Holland's alone and in a churchyard on such anight as this? Gabriel, gobbling. Gabriel, gobbling. Exclaim the wild voices again. And who then is our lawful prize? Exclaim the goblin, raising his voice. The invisible chorus replied. Gabriel, gobbling. Gabriel, gobbling. Well, Gabriel, what do you say to this? Said the gobbling. As he grinned a border grinned and before. The sexton gasped for brass. What do you think of this, Gabriel? It's very curious, very curious. And very pretty. Reply the sexton half dead with fright. But I think I'll go back and finish my works, sir. If you please, work. Said the gobbling. What work? The grapes, sir. Oh, the grape, right? Who makes grapes at a time when other man or mellie and takes a peasant? Again, the voices replied. Gabriel, gobbling. I'm afraid my friends won't you, Gabriel. Said the gobbling. On their favour, sir. Reply the horror-stricken sexton. I don't think they can. They don't know me, sir. I don't think the gentleman have ever seen me. Oh, yes, they have. We know the man who struck the boy in the end of the asmeras of his heart because the boy could be married and he could not. Here, the gobbling gave a loud, shrill laugh, which the echoes returned, twenty-fold. I am afraid I must leave you, sir. Said the sexton, making an effort to move. Leave us, said the gobbling. As the gobbling laughed, he suddenly darted towards Gabriel. Ladies hand upon his collar and sank with him through the earth. And when he had had time to fetch his breath, he found himself in what appeared to be a large cavern, surrounded on all sides by goblins of Glyangrim. And now, said the king of the goblins, seated in the centre of the room on an elevated seat. His friend of the churchyard, show the man of misery and blue a few of the pictures from our great storehouses. As the gobbling said this, a clown rolled gradually away and disclosed a small and scantly furnished with meat apartment. The two children were gathered around the bright fire, clinging to their mother's gown, or gambling around her chair. A frugal meal was spread upon the table, and an elbow chair was placed near the fire. Soon the father entered, and the children ran to meet him. As he sat down to his meal, the father sat by his side, and all seemed happiness and comfort. What do you think of that? Said the goblins. Gabriel murmured something about it's being very pretty. Show him some more. Said the goblins. Many a time the clown went and came, and many a lesson, it taught to Gabriel grab. He saw that man who worked hard and earned their scanty bread, were cheerful and happy. And he came for the conclusion, it was a very respectable sort of a world after all. No sooner had he formed it, then the clown closed over the last picture, seemed to set along his senses, and loll him to repair. One by one, the goblins faded from his sight, and as the last one disappeared, he sank to sleep. The day had broken when he awoke and found himself lying on the flat grape stand with the wicker bottle empty by his side. He got on his feet, as well as he could, and brushing the frost off his cage, turned his face toward the town. But he was an altered man. He had learned lessons of gentleness and good nature by his strange adventures in the goblins cavern.

Preface Supposing that truth is a woman, what then? Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, insofar as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand women? That the terrible seriousness and clumsy impotunity, with which they have usually paid their addresses to truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be one, and it present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mean, if, indeed, it stands at all. For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground, name or that it is at its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble pluralism and tyranism, and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood what has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared. Perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time, such as the soul superstition, which, in the form of subject and ego superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief. Perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalisation of very restricted, very personal, very human, all two human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more labour, gold, acuteness and patience have been spent, than on any actual science hitherto. We owe to it, and to its super terrestrial pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of architecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first wonder about the earth, as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures. Dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind, for instance the Vedantic doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist era. Namely, Plato's invention of pure spirit, and the good in itself. But now, when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath freely, and at least enjoy a healthier sleep. We, whose duty is wakefulness itself, are the airs of all the strength, which the struggle against this era has fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the perspective, the fundamental condition of life, to speak of spirit and the good as Plato spoke of them. Indeed, one might ask, as a physician, how did such a melody attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked socrates really corrupted him, whilst socrates after all the corruptor of youths, and deserved his hemlock? But the struggle against Plato, or, to speak plainer and for the people, the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity, for Christianity is Platonism for the people. Produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously, with such a tensly strained bow, one can now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand-style to one bend the bow, once by means of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic enlightenment, which, with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper reading, might, in fact, bring it about, so that the spirit would not so easily find itself in distress. The Germans invented gunpowder, or credit to them, but they again made things square, they invented printing. But we, who are neither Jesuits nor Democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we good Europeans and free, very free spirits, we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow, and perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and who knows, the goal to aim at.

Alexander of Macedonia once entered into a neighboring and wealthy province of Africa. The inhabitants came forth to meet him and brought him their robes filled with cold and apples and fruits. Eat this fruit among yourselves, said Alexander, I am not come to see your wealth but to learn your customs. They then conducted him to the market where their king administered justice. A citizen, just then, came before him and said, I have bought of this man O'King a sack full of chef and have found in it a secret treasure. The chef is mine but not the gold and this man will not take it again. The man to him O'King that he received it for it is his own. And his antagonist, a citizen also of the place answered, thou a theorist to retain anything unjustly and should not I also fear to receive such a thing from thee, I have sold thee the sack with all that was in it. Keep it for it is thine. Come and to him O'King. Keep it for it is the king inquired of the first one if he had a son. He answered yes. He inquired of the other if he had a daughter and the same answer. Yes, was returned. Well them said the king, you are both just men, marry your children to each other and give them the discovered treasure as a marriage portion. That is my verdict. So Exander was astonished when he heard this decision. Have I judged unjustly, said the king of this remote country, that thou art thus astonished? Not at all answered Alexander, but in our country they would have judged far otherwise. And how then would they have judged, inquired the African King? So if parties would have lost their heads answered Alexander and their treasure would have fallen into the hands of the king. Then the king clashed his hands together and said, does the son then shine upon you and do the heavens still shower their reign upon you? Alexander replied yes. It must then be continued the king for the sake of the innocent beasts which live in your country for a pound such men, no son should shine and no reign should fall.

Recording by Russell Newton. Celebrated Crimes, Volume 6. Part 2. By Alexander Dumont. Chapter 1. Part 1. The Man in the Iron Mask. And essay. For nearly 100 years, this curious problem has exercised the imagination of writers of fiction, and of drama, and the patience of the learned in history. No subject is more obscure and elusive, and none more attractive to the general mind. It is a legend to the meaning of which none can find the key, and yet in which everyone believes. Involentarily, we feel pity at the thought of that long captivity, surrounded by so many extraordinary precautions, and when we dwell on the mystery which enveloped the captive, that pity is not only deepened, but a kind of terror takes possession of us. It is very likely that if the name of the hero of this gloomy tale had been known at the time, he would now be forgotten. To give him a name, would be to relegate him at once to the ranks of those commonplace offenders, who quickly exhaust our interest and our tears. But this being, cut off from the world without leaving any discoverable trace, and whose disappearance apparently caused no void, this captive distinguished among captives by the unexampled nature of his punishment, a prison within a prison, as if the walls of a mere cell were not narrow enough, has come to tipify for us the sum of all the human misery and suffering ever inflicted by unjust tyranny. Who was the man in the Iron Mask, was he wrapped away into this silent seclusion from the luxury of a court from the intrigues of diplomacy, from the scaffold of a traitor, from the clash of battle, what did he leave behind? Love, glory, or throne, what did he regret when Hoped fled? Did he pour forth implications and curses on his tortures and blaspheme against High Heaven, or did he with a sigh possess his soul in patience? The blows of fortune are differently received according to the different characters of those on whom they fall, and each one of us who in imagination threads the subterranean passages leading to the cells of Piniorole and Exiles, and incarcerates himself in the ill same margari and in the best deal, the successive scenes of that long protractive agony will give the prisoner a form shaped by his own fancy and a grief proportion to his own power of suffering. How he long to pierce the thoughts and feel the heartbeats and watch the trickling tears behind that machine like exterior that impassable mask. Our imagination is powerfully excited by the dumbness of that fate born by one whose words never reached the outward air, whose thoughts could never be read on the hidden features, by the isolation of 40 years secured by twofold barriers of stone and iron, and she closed the object over contemplation in majestic splendour, connects the mystery which envelopes his existence with mighty interests, and persists in regarding the prisoner's sacrifice for the preservation of some diagnostic secret involving the peace of the world and the stability of a throne. And when we calmly reflect on the whole case, do we feel that our first impulsively adopted opinion was wrong? Do we regard our belief as a poetical illusion? I do not think so. On the contrary, it seems to me that our goods sense approves our fancy's flight. For what can be more natural than the conviction that the secret of the name, age, and features of the captive, which was so perseveringly captured long years at the cost of so much care, was a vital importance to the government. No ordinary human passion, such as anger, hate, or vengeance, has so dogged and enduring a character. We feel that the measures taken were not the expression of a love of cruelty. For even supposing that Louis XIV were the most cruel of princes, would he not have chosen one of the thousand methods of torture ready to his hand, before inventing a new and strange one? Moreover, why did he voluntarily burden himself, with the obligation of surrounding a prisoner with such numberless precautions, and such sleepless vigilance? Must he not have feared that, in spite of it all, the walls behind which he concealed the dread mystery would one day, let in the light, wasn't not through his entire reign, a source of unceasing anxiety? And yet he respected the life of the captive, whom it was so difficult to hide, and the discovery of whose identity would have been so dangerous. It would have been so easy to bury the secret in an obscure grave, and yet the order was never given. Was this an expression of hate, anger, or any other passion? Certainly not. The conclusion we must come to in regard to the conduct of the king, is that all the measures he took against the prisoner were dictated by purely political motives, that his conscience, while allowing him to do everything necessary to guard the secret, did not permit him to take the further step of putting an end to the days of an unfortunate man, who, in all probability, was guilty of no crime. Courteers are seldom obsequious to the enemies of their master, so that we may regard the respect and consideration shown to the man in the mask by the governor, St. Mars, and the Minister Lovois, as a testimony, not only to his high rank, but also to his innocence. For my part, I make no pretensions to the air edition of the bookworm, and I cannot read the history of the man in the Iron Mask without feeling my blood boil at the abominable abuse of power, the heinous crime of which he was the victim. A few years ago, Mr. Fony and I, thinking the subject suitable for a representation on the stage, undertook to read, before dramatizing it, all the different versions of the affair which have been published up to that time. Since our piece was successfully performed at the Odeon, two other versions have appeared. One was in the form of a letter, addressed to the historical institute by Mr. Billyard, who upheld the conclusions arrived at by Sulevy, on whose narrative our play was founded. The other was a work by the Bibliophile Jacob, who followed a new system of inquiry and whose book displayed the results of deep research and extensive reading. It did not, however, cause me to change my opinion. Even had it been published before I had written my drama. I should still have adhered to the idea as to the most probable solution of the problem which I had arrived at in 1831. Not only because it was incontestably the most dramatic, but also because it is supported by those moral presumptions, which have such weight with us when considering a dark and doubtful question like the one before us. It will be objected perhaps that dramatic writers, in their love of the marvellous and the pathetic, neglect logic and strain after effect, their aim, being to obtain the applause of the gallery rather than the apparition of the learning. But to this, it may be replied that the learned on their part sacrificed a great deal to their love of dates, more or less exact. To their desire to elucidate some point which had hitherto been considered obscure and which their explanations do not always clear up. To the temptation to display their proficiency in the ingenious art of manipulating facts and figures called from a dozen musty volumes into one consistent hole. Our interest in this strange case of imprisonment arises, not alone from its completeness and duration, but also from our uncertainty as to the motives from which it was inflicted, where air-addition alone cannot suffice, where bookworm after bookworm, disdaining the conjectures of his predecessors comes forward with a new theory, found it on some forgotten document he has hunted out, only to find himself in his turn pushed into oblivion by some follower in his track. We must turn for guidance to some other light than that of scholarship, especially if on strict investigation, we find that not one learned solution rests on a sound basis effect. In the question before us which, as we said before, is a double one, asking not only who was the man in the iron mask, but why he was relentlessly subjected to this torture till the moment of his death, what we need in order to restrain our fancy is mathematical demonstration and not philosophical induction. While I do not go so far as to assert positively that Abbey Solivy has once and for all lifted the veil which hit the truth, I'm yet persuaded that no other system of research is superior to his, and that no other suggested solution has so many presumption in its favor. I have not reached this firm conviction on account of the great and prolonged success of our drama, but because of the ease with which all the opinions adverse to those of Abbey may be annihilated by pitting them one against the other, the qualities that make for success being quite different in a novel and in a drama. I could easily have founded romance on the fictitious loves of Buckingham in the Queen, or on a supposed secret marriage between her and Cardinal Mazarin, calling to my aid a work by a San Mehl with the bibliophile declares he has never read, although does assuredly neither rare nor difficult of access. I might also have merely expanded my drama, restoring to the percentages they're in their true names in relative positions, both of which the exigencies of the stage has sometimes obliged me to alter, and while allowing them to fill the same parts, making them act more in accordance with historical fact. No fable, however far-fetched, no grouping of characters, however improbable, can, however, destroy the interest, which the innumerable writings about the Iron Mask excite, although no two agree in details, and although each author and each witness declares himself in possession of complete knowledge. No work, however mediocre, however worthless even, which has appeared on this subject has ever failed of success. Not even, for example, the strange jumble of Chivalier de Mohie, a kind of literary bragher, who was in the pay of Voltaire and whose work was published anonymously in 1746, by Pierre de Haunt of the Hague. It is divided into six short parts and bears the title, the Mask de Faire, Ulea Vincières, Amrable, Du Pérez, Etu Fils, and absurd romance by Renault Warren, and one, at least equally absurd by Madame Jeanard, met with a like-favorable reception, in writing for the theater an author must choose one view of a dramatic situation to the exclusion of all others, and in following out this central idea is obliged by the inexorable laws of logic to push aside everything that interferes with its development. A book on the contrary is written to be discussed, it brings under the notice of the reader all the evidence produced at a trial which has yet not reached a definite conclusion, and which in the case before us will never reach it, unless which is most improbable, some lucky chance should lead to some new discovery. The first mention of the prisoner is to be found in the memoirs set cleats, post-severe Alistair de Paris, in one volume, by an anonymous author published by the company de la Bréelle's Oceus-Stamps de Damme in 1745. Not having any other purpose says the author page 20, second edition, then to relate facts which are not known, or about which no one has written. We refer it once to a fact which has hitherto almost escaped noticed concerning Prince Giafire, Louis de Babon, Compt de Vemondois, son of Louis XIV, and Madame Aswell de la Valleier, who was visited by Ali Mamajou, the Duke Dorlaine's The Regent. In the fortress of Ispahan, the Bastille, in which he had been in prison for several years. The visit had probably no other motive, then to make sure that this Prince was really alive, he having been reputed dead of the plague for over 30 years, and his obsequies having been celebrated in presence of an entire army. Shah Abbas, Louis XIV, had a legitimate son, Seffi Mirza, Louis, Dothin of France, and a natural son, Giafire. These two princes, as dissimilar in character as in birth, were always rivals, and always at enmity with each other. One day, Giafire so far forgot himself, as to strike Seffi Mirza. Shah Abbas, having heard of the insult offered to the air to the throne, assembled his most trusted counselors and laid the conduct of the culprit before them, conduct which, according to the law of the country, was punishable with death, and opinion in which they all agreed. One of the counselors, however, sympathizing more than the others with the distress of Shah Abbas, suggested that Giafire should be sent to the army, which was then on the frontiers of Fidrun, Flanders, and that his death from plague should be given out a few days after his arrival. Then, while the whole army was celebrating his obsequies, he should be carried off by night in the greatest secrecy to the stronghold on the Isle of Ormus, Seimagati, and their imprisonment for life. This course was adopted and carried out by faithful and discreet agents. The prince, whose premature death was mourned by the army, being carried by unfricmented roads to the Isle of Ormus, was placed in the custody of the common dawn to the Isle, who had received orders beforehand not to allow any person whatever to see the prisoner. A single servant, who was in possession of the secret, was killed by the escort on the journey, and his face so disfigured by dagger thrusts that he could not be recognized. The common dawn treated his prisoner with the most profound respect, he waited on him at meals himself, taking the dishes from the cooks at the door of the apartment, none of whom ever looked on the face of Giafair. One day, it occurred to the prince to scratch his name on the back of a plate with his knife, one of the servants into whose hands the plate fell ran with it at once to the common dawn, hoping he would be pleased and reward the bearer. But the unfortunate man was greatly mistaken, for he was at once made away with, that his knowledge of such an important secret might be buried with himself. Giafair remained several years in the castle almost, and was then transported to the fortress of Ispahan. The common dawns of Ormus having received the governorship of Ispahan as a reward for his faithful service. At Ispahan, as at Ormus, whenever it was necessary on account of illness or any other cause to allow anyone to approach the prince, he was always masked. And several trustworthy persons have asserted that they had seen the mass prisoner often, and had noticed that he used the familiar two when addressing the governor while the latter showed his charge the greatest respect. As Giafair survived Shahabas and Seffi Mirza by many years, it may be asked why he was never said at liberty. But it must be remembered it would have been impossible to restore a prince to his rank and dignities whose tomb actually existed, and if who's burial, there were not only living witnesses, but documentary proofs, the authenticity of which it would have been useless to deny, so formulas of the belief which had lasted down to the present day. That Giafair died of the plague and camp when with the army on the frontiers of flanders. Ali Homoju died shortly after the visit he paid to Giafair. This version of the story, which is the original source of all the controversy on the subject, was at first generally received his true. On a critical examination it fitted in very well with certain events which took place in the reign of Louis the 14th. The Compt, De Vimondwah, had in fact left the court for the camp very soon after his reappearance there, for he had been banished by the king from his present sometime before for having, in company with several young nobles, indulged in the most reprehensible excesses. The king says Med-Mu-Zel-Demond-Ponsee, Memoirs-Demond-Mu-Zel-Demond-Ponsee, Volume 14, Page 474, of Memoirs-Relatives-Distur-De France, Second-Series published by Pettito, had not been satisfied with his conduct and refused to see him. The young prince had caused his mother much sorrow, but had been so well-leksured that it was believed that he had at last turned over a new leave. He only remained four days at court, reached the camp before a court tray early in November 1683, was taken ill on the evening of the 12th and died on the 19th of the same month of a malignant fever. Med-Mu-Zel-Demond-Ponsee says that the Compt-Divrement-Wah fell ill from drink. There are, of course, objections of all kinds to this theory. For if, during the four days the Compt was at court, he had struck the dolphin, everyone would have heard of the monstrous crime, and yet it is nowhere spoken of, except in the memoirs' depace. What renders the story of the blow still more improbable is the difference in age between the two princes, the Duffin, who already had a son, the Duke de Borgonia, more than a year old, was born the first November 1661, and was therefore six years older than the Compt-Divrement-Wah. But the most complete answer to the tale is to be found in a letter written by Barbazio to St. Maugh dated the 13th August 1691. When you have any information to send me relative to the prisoner who has been in your charge for 20 years, I most earnestly enjoy an on you to take the same precautions as when you write to Monsieur de la Voix. The Compt-Divrement-Wah, the official registration of whose death bears the date 1685, cannot have been 20 years as a prisoner in 1691. Six years after the man in the mask had been thus delivered over the curiosity of the public, the sickly de la Voix, the 14th, two volumes, octavo, burlin, 1751, was published by Voltaire under the pseudonym of Monsieur de Frasbel. Everyone turned to this work which had been long-expected for details relating to the mysterious prisoner about whom everyone was talking. Voltaire ventured at length to speak more openly of the prisoner than anyone had hitherto done and to treat as a matter of history and event long ignored by all historians, volume 2 page 11 first edition chapter 15. He assigned an approximate date to the beginning of this captivity some months after the death of Cardinal Mazarin 1661. He gave a description of the prisoner who according to him was young and dark complexion. His figure was above the middle height and well-proportion. His features were exceedingly handsome and his bearing was noble when he spoke his voice inspired interest. He never complained of his lot and gave no hint as to his rank nor was the mask forgotten. The part which covered the chin was furnished with steel springs which allowed the prisoner to eat without uncovering his face and lastly he fixed the date of the death of the nameless captive who was buried he says in 1704 by night in the Paris Church of Saint Paul. Voltaire's narrative coincided with the account given in the memoir that pairs. Save for the admission of the incident which according to the memoirs, led in the first instance to the imprisonment of Jaffaire. The prisoner says Voltaire was sent to the Eelsamagli and afterwards to the best steel in charge of his trusty official. He wore his mask on the journey and his escort had orders to shoot him if he took it off. The marquee de la Vova visited him while he was on the islands and when speaking to him stood all the time in a respectful attitude. The prisoner was removed to the best steel in 1690 where he was lodged as comfortably as could be managed in that building. He was supplied with everything he asked for, especially with the finest linen and the costliest lace in both of which his taste was perfect. He had a good tar to play on, his table was excellent and the governor rarely sat in his presence.

The Greyhors stopped by a post on the other side of the road from the little wooden station as if he knew what was expected of him. And a young girl got out of the carriage and fastened him with a strap. The horse bowed his head two or three times as if to let her know the hitching was unnecessary, but he would overlook it this time seeing it what she who had done it. The girls fingers did their work with a custom skill, but the horse saw that she was preoccupied and she turned from him toward the station a trifle reluctantly. There was a grave pucker between her eyebrows that showed her present duty was not one of choice. She walked deliberately into the little waiting room occupied by some women and noisy children and compared her watch with the grim-faced clock behind the agents grating. She asked in a clear voice if the 555 New York train was on time, and being sure that it was, she went out to the platform to look up the long stretch of track gleaming in the late afternoon sun and to wait. 5 miles away, speeding toward the same station, another girl of about the same age set in a chair car, impatiently watching the houses, trees and telegraph poles as they flew by. She had gathered her possessions about her preparatory to leaving the train and had been doily brushed by the of sequie's colored porter, who seemed to have her in charge, and she now wore an air of impatient submission to the inevitable. She was on mistakenly city bread and wealthy, from the crown of her elaborate black chiffon hat to the tip of her elegant boot. She looked with scorn on the rich farming country, with its plain useful buildings and occasional pretty homes, through which she was being carried. It was evident, even to the casual onlooker, that this journey she was taking was hardly to her taste. She felt a wave of her belly in toward her father, now well on his way to another continent, for having insisted upon amyring her in a small backcountry village with his maiden sister during his enforced absence. He might well enough have left her in New York with a suitable shap rom if he had only thought so, or taken her along, though that would have been a bore as he was too heard with business to be able to give time and thought to making it pleasant for her. She threw her pretty forehead into a frown as she thought the next question over again, and contemplated with dread the six stupid weeks before she could hope for his return and her release from exile. She pouted her lips in annoyance as she thought of a certain young man who was to be in New York during the winter. She was to have met him at a dinner this very night. She wandered for the hundredth time if it could possibly be, that Papa had heard of her friendship with a scayong fellow, and because of it, had hustled her off to Hillcrofts so unceremoniously. Her cheeks burned at the thought, and she bit her lips angrily. Papa was so particular, meant it not know how to bring up a girl anyway. If only her mother had lived, she felt sure she would not have had such old fashioned notions. For her mother had been quite a gay woman of fashion, from what people in society said of her. There was nothing that mattered with this Mr. Verthington either, a little fast, but it had not hurt him. He was delightful company. Father sought to know that their daughters enjoyed men with some spirit, and not Nambi Pambi, Milkend Water Creatures. Probably Papa had been gay in his youth also. She had heard it said that all men were, in which case he ought to be lenient toward other young men, and not expect them to be grave and solemn before their time. Mr. Verthington dressed perfectly, and that was a good deal. She liked to see a man well dressed. Papa was certainly very foolish about her. With this filly-al reflection, the young woman arose as the train came to her. And followed the porter from the car. Several passengers allotted, but the girl on the platform knew instinctively that the young woman in the elegant grey brought cloth skirt and stainty shirt waste, carrying on her arm her grey coat, which showed more than a gleam of the turquoise blue silk lining. And unconcernedly trailing her long skirt on the dirty platform was the one with whom she had to do. Alison Gray waited just the least perceptible second before she stepped forward. She told herself afterward that it made it so much worse to have that shining black porter standing smiling and bowing to listen. She felt that her duty was fully as disagreeable as she had feared. Yet she was one who usually faced duty cheerfully. She could not help glancing down at her own blue-sourge skirt and plain white shirt waste. And remembering that her hands were guiltless of gloves as she walked forward to where the other girls did. His dismiss brotherhood, she asked, trying to keep her voice from trembling and hoping her mental perturbation was not visible. The traveler wheeled with a graceful turn of her tall figure that left the tailor-made skirt in lovely curved lines, which Alison, with her artist's eye, noted at once. And stared. Evelyn Rutherford's eyes were black and had an expression which in a less refined type of girl would have been called saucy. In her it was modified into hotness. She looked Alison Gray over and it seemed to Alison that she took a count of every discrepancy and her plain little toilet before she answered. It is. There was that in the tone of the answer that said, and what business of yours made that be pray. Alison's cheeks flushed and there came a sparkle in her eye that spoke of other feelings then her quiet answer be token. Then when you come this way please, the carriage is on the other side of the station. Your aunt, Miss Rutherford, was unable to meet you and I have come in her place. If you will give me your check, I will see that your baggage is attended to at once. Indeed. Said the bewildered traveler and she followed the other girl with an air of injured dignity. Was this some kind of a superior servant her aunt had sent to take her place? Her maid perhaps. She certainly did not speak or act like a servant and yet, then her indignation waxed great. To think that her father's sister should treat her in this way, not even come to the station to meet her when she was an entire stranger. And had never even seen her since she was three years old. In New York, of course, she would not have expected it. Things were different, but she had always understood that country people made a great deal of meeting their friends at the station. Her aunt had spoken of this in her letter, a fine welcome to be sure. She could not be ill or this person would have mentioned it at once. She entirely forgot that a few moments before one of her greatest grievances had been that she feared her aunt would bore her with a show of affection. Or she remembered the many choruses of her babyhood and distinctly, and her nature was not one that cared for women in affection over much. Allison showed the colored porter where to deposit the bags and umbrellas on the station platform, and taking the checks given her left the elegant stranger standing amid her belongings. Looking with this stain at the pony fate and across the road, and wondering where the carriage could be. She was growing angry at being left standing so long when she became aware that the girl across the road untying the pony was the same one who had gone away with her checks. And it began to dawn upon her that she was expected to get into that small conveyance with this other girl. She submitted with what grace she could as there seemed to be nothing else to be done, but the expression on her face was anything but pleasant, and she demanded an explanation of the state of things in no sweet manner. What is the meaning of all this? Is this my aunt's carriage? Where is her driver? She asked empiriously. Having made a permide that this girl was a servant, she concluded to treat her accordingly. It was characteristic of Allison that she waited until she had carefully spread the clean linen robe over the gray broad cloth skirt. Gathered her reins deliberately, and given the pony word to go before she answered. Even then, she did not speak until the fate and was turned around, and they were fairly started spinning over the smooth road under the arching trees. By that time, her voice was sweet and steady, and her temper was well under her control. I am very sorry, Miss Rutherford, that you should suffer any inconvenience. She said, It is certainly not so pleasant for you as if your aunt had been able to meet you as she planned. No, this is not her carriage, it belongs to us, and we are her neighbors and dear friends. She forced herself to say this with a pleasant smile, although she felt somehow as if this girl beside her would resent it. Really, Interpolated Miss Rutherford, as one who awaits a much-needed explanation. Yes, your aunt was expecting you, looking forward with great pleasure to your coming, she bade me say. Went on Allison, reciting her lesson a trifle stiffly. And only two hours ago, she discovered serious illness among her household, which they are afraid may be contagious, they cannot tell for some hours yet. She does not wish you to come to the house until they are sure. She hopes that it will be all right for you to come home by tomorrow, or the next day at most. And in the meantime, we will try to make you as comfortable as possible. Your aunt sent us word by the doctor this morning, asking me to meet you and explain why it would not be safe for her to meet you. I am Allison Gray. We live quite at the other end of town from Miss Rutherford, so you will be entirely safe from any infection should it prove to be serious? Miss Rutherford was kind enough to think my mother could make you a little more comfortable than anyone else. Allison was almost in her usual spirits as she finished speaking. It would not be so bad after the stranger understood surely. She did not add what Miss Rutherford had said about having her niece with herself, Allison as she hoped another girl's company would make her feel less lonely and strange. For Allison saw at once that this was not a girl who cared for other girls company as straw, at least not such as she. Evelyn Rutherford's face was a study, She grand and astonishment struggled for the mastery. I do not understand, she said, who is ill in the family that could prevent by admitting me, I thought she lived alone. She does, said Allison quickly, except for her two servants, it is one of them the cook. She has been with Miss Rutherford for 15 years you know, and is almost like her own flesh and blood to her. Besides she has taken care of her all night herself. Before she knew there was any need for caution, and if it is smallpox as they fear, she has been fully exposed to it already, so it would not be safe for her to come to you until they are sure. Hovers exclaimed the stranger and Allison saw that her face turned a deadly white. Stop, turn around, I will go right back to New York. You need not feel afraid, set Allison gently. There is none of it in town, and this case is entirely isolated. The woman has been away on a visit to her brother and probably took the disease there. She came home only yesterday, she came back sooner than she intended, because you were coming and Miss Rutherford sent for her. There is really no cause for alarm, for the utmost care will be taken if it should prove to be smallpox, and by morning we may hear that it is all alright and she is getting well, and it is not that at all. Besides, there is no New York train going out tonight. The last one passed yours about 10 miles back. You will have to stay until tomorrow anyway. Mercy! said the stranger, seeming not to be able to find words to express her feelings. She was certainly taking the news very badly, but her host is hoped she would behave better when she was fully possessed of effects. Miss Rutherford asked a few more questions about her aunt, commenting scornfully upon her devotion to a servant, which brought an angry flush into the other girls' cheek, and then settled down to the inevitable. Upon reflection she decided it would be better to wait and write or telegraph to her friends in New York before returning to them. Indeed, there was no one in town just then, for it was early for people to return to the city, with whom she felt sufficiently intimate to drop down upon them unannounced for a prolonged visit, and she knew that her father would utterly disapprove of her being with any of them anyway. Do your people keep aborting house? She asked, turning curious eyes on Allison, who flushed again under the tone, which sounded to her insulin, but waited until she had disentangled the reins from the pony's tail before she replied gently. No. Well, but, I don't understand. Said the guest, Did you not say that my aunt had arranged for me to board with you? A bright spot came in each of Allison's cheeks, air she replied with gentle dignity. No, you are to visit us if you will. Your aunt is a dear friend of my mother, Miss Rutherford. She resolved in her heart that she would never never call this girl Evelyn. She did not want the intimate friendship that her old friend had hinted at in telling her first of the coming of this city, niece. Allison was favored with another disagreeable stare, but she gave her attention to the pony. Really, I'm obliged, said the guest, and I see tones that made Allison feel as if she had been guilty of unparadatable in pertinent and inviting her. Was there no hotel or private boarding house to which I could have gone? I dislike to be under obligations to entire strangers. Allison's tones were as isolated dignified now as her unwilling guests as she replied. Certainly, there are two hotels and there is a boarding house. You would hardly care to stay in the boarding house by fancy. It has not the reputation of being very clean. I can take you to either of the hotels if you wish, but even in Hillcroft, it would scarcely be the thing for a young girl to stay alone at one of them. We sometimes hear of shaperones even as far west as this Miss Rutherford. Allison's eyes were bright as she drew herself up straight in the carriage as she said this, she remembered almost immediately the pained look that would have come into her mother's eyes. If she had heard this exhibition of something besides a meac and quiet spirit, and she tried to control herself. Yet inspired of the way in which she had spoken, her words had some effect on the young woman by her side. She had been met by the enemy on her own ground and vanquished. She had a faint idea that her brother Dick would have remarked something about being poised with his own petard. Had he been by, for she was want to be particular about these things at home. She felt thankful that he was several hundreds of miles away. She said no more about hotels. She understood the matter of shaperones even better than did Allison great, and strange as it may seem. Allison rose in her estimation several degrees after her haughty speech. There was silence in the fateful for some minutes. Then the driver spoke to point out a dingy house close to the street with several dingy children playing about the steps. There was a sign in one window on a fly-speced card, rooms to rent, and a card hung out on a stick nailed to the door frame, fetched bullsoup today. This is the boarding house, said Allison, do you wish me to leave you here? Her spirit was not quite subdued yet. Evelyn Rutherford looked and uttered an exclamation of horror, her companion caught the expression and a spirit of fun took the place of her look of indignation, inspired her herself she laughed, but the girl beside her was too much used to having her own way to relish any such joke as this. She maintained and offended silence. They passed the two hotels of the town, facing one another on post office square. There were lounges smoking on the steps, and on the long peouses of both, and at the open door of one, a dashing young woman, with a loud laugh and louder attire, joked openly with a crowd of men and seemed to be proud of her position among them. Evelyn curled her lip, and shank into the carriage farther at thought of herself as a guest at that house. I fear I shall have to trouble you at least until I can communicate with my ad or make other arrangements. She said stiffly, and added condescendingly, I'm sure I'm much obliged. Then the carriage turned in at a flower-borted driveway with glimpses of a pretty lawn beyond the fringe of crimps and blossoms, and the Miss Brotherford realized that her journey was at an end.

Autumn leaves by Anne Wheels Abbott. Chapter 16, The Old Sealer. In my school vacations I used occasionally to visit an old sailor friend, a man of uncommon natural gifts, and that varied experience of life, which does so much to supply the one of the other means of education. He must have been a handsome man in his youth, and no time in hardship had done their utmost to make a rune of his old features and had made it needful to breed his still, jerry black logs together. To cover his bald crime, he was a fine striking head yet to my boy's fancy. I love to sit at his feet and hear him tell the events of 60 years of toilet danger, suffering a well-earned joy. As he leaned with both hands upon his stoutes staff, his body swaying with the earnestness of his speech. His labourers and pearls for night ended and in his age an infirmity he had found a quiet he even. He had built a small house by the side of the home of his childhood, and his son who followed his father's vocation, lived under the same roof, this son and two daughters were all that remained to him of a large family, an easily bank, on the western league limb, our certain signs of a wet skin, said the fishermen pointing to the heavy black masses of cloud, that hung over the eastern horizon, one morning when I had risen, at sunrise for a day's fishing. Don't do, don't go out today. There shins such a breeze offshore, as with the heavy chop, but make you second-of, besides the old dory, won't put up with such a storm as it's coming, no fishing my boy today. His old father said, Stephen is right, there is a blue brewing, and he came to look, leaning on his can, stay in today. I yielded on the sky during the morning slowly assumed a dull, late and he, the storm came on in the afternoon, heavily pattering, I'm pouring and blowing against the windows, and I'm scaring the little light of an autumn twilight. I wandered through the few small rooms of the cottage, endeavoring to amuse myself while the light lasted, but two funeral sermons on an old newspaper, then I sat down out of window, and I well remembered the glimmy landscape, seen through the rain in the dusk, the marsh, with the cricked fighting it, the bare-rined eminence between the high sun the beach, or rather the rocky cliffs, and on either side, the wide, lonely sands, with heavy foam-capped breakfast rolling in upon the shore, with a sign like a solemn, durge, at a distance on the left half-hidden by the walnut trees, and lay the reins of a mill, which had always the air of being hunted. A high rocky hill, very nearly perpendicular, on the side next to the house, was covered on the sides and topped with gin-a-purge pines and other ever-grings. As the darkness second I left the lonely bastrim for the seat, and the large chimney corner in the kitchen, the old-wife taught her mind, making preparations for the evening meal, a mothered recollections of shipwrecks, which the storm brought to her mind. Not in the end she would go to window turn back her cap-order, from her forehead, put her face close to the glass, shading off the fire light with her hand, and gaze out into the darkness. Asa did not go out either, thank the good father, she said, the dog wind pitiously, sit, sit, push, gip. Here, shall have a piece, good dog, a fearful night, indeed it is. The two men came in, from the barn shook off the wet, and drew near the fire, just such a night twenty-nine years ago, come August, we ran a file of Hattarra's. You remember Old Woman, how they frighty eave I'd made do ye, amidst such reminessences we were called to supper, I remember being solemnly impressed, when that old-bomb, bent with hardship on the way of years, clasped his hands, evidently, undenured terms, but full of meaning, asked a blessing upon their humble board. I remember the flickering light from the logs burning on the hearth, at how it chewed upon the faces of those who sat there, a strong feeling of the words in which rose, an adept petition and behalf of those on the mighty deep. Sopper being ended the old man took down the tobacco board, and when he had caught enough to fill his pipe, handed it to his son who, having done the same restored it to its nail, in the chimney corner, then they smoked and talked to dangerous breath and overcome a pirates and shipwrecks of escapes, till I involuntarily drew closer into my corner, and looked over my shoulder. Suddenly the dog under the table gave a winding grile. I never see the light of that dog exclaimed the fisherman turning to me, I thought he was asleep, but if ever a fit comes night, the house at night he gives notice, depend on that there's someone coming, the door of the little entry opened, with a rush of the whistling wind, an amounts tapped in, the dog half froze, and though he wagged his tail and took in that he knew the step to be that of a friend he kept up a low-wine, a young man, muffled to the eyes, and with the water dripping from his huge pijagot, opened to the kitchen door, while him crossed by, why what brings you out in such a storm assess, strip off your coat and draw up to the fire, can't he, where are you buying them, and the night as dark as the wolf's throat, the young fisherman made no answer or less by emotion of his hand, and as he turned back the collar from his face, he saw her by the waving light that it was peel-a-staff, the long wet logs already lay upon his cheeks, making them more ghastly, as he struggled to speak, oh Stephen Lee there's no time to be set by the fire, when old Assa Osborne is rolling in the waters, a man strained, and who's to get the body for the wife and the children, go pity them, a for the ab carys at Ike to see, the old man drew his hand across his forehead and rose, I looked at him as he drew up, his tall figure, and looked the young messenger fell in the eye, in a low deep whisper he said, who, William, did you say? He said a man strained, but tell me the name again, yes, Grancer, I did say it all don't go ask flaming, he, I'm the minister, when I'm fishing in the morning, the minister got his boots off in the water, and after a long time he swam ashore, but per uncle asked, Stephen Covellong, his per wife's gone down to the beach, they left the house and shut the door after them, and came back softly to the seat, by the old man's knee, once before I had seen him, when a heavy sorrow fell upon him, it was on a beautiful summer day, on the open window, let in the cold breeze from the sea, he was sitting by it in his armchair, looking out upon the calm water, buried in thought, his favorite daughter, had long been very low and might sink away at any moment, the old dog was at his feet asleep, the clock ticked in the corner, and the sun was shining upon the floor, some friends sat by in silence with sorrowful condolences, his little grandchild came to his side and said, Mother says, the grandpa, Aunt Lassie's gone home, the old man did not alter his position, for some time he sat in deep thought, looking out with unseen gaze and winding his thumbs as before, a five-fair daughter's three-half-before died by the same disease consumption, he had seen them slowly fade away one by one and had followed his children to the grave in the scheduled, bearing ground where the green sawed was died to be broken, to receive the fourth, rising slowly he walked across the room and taking the well-worn family Bible, returned with it to his seat, and as he turned the leaves, he said an alone tone to himself, there's only one left now, then he sat entirely silent with his eyes fixed upon the sacred page, he did not utter one word of lamentation, he did not shed a tear, but as he turned his eye on me and passing, it's expression went to my heart, stealing softly out I left him to the silent comforter, his blessing is on the mourner, now the scene was changed, while musundly taken from his side, who had been a companion from boyhead to old age, they had played and worked in company, together they had embarked on their first voyage, and their last, and they had settled down in close neighborhood in the evening of their days, each had preserved the other's life, in some moment of peril, but took small priest himself for too simple an act of duty, few words of fondness had ever passed between them, they had gone along the path of life, with I perhaps being conscious of any peccas you may strong tie a friendship binding them together, till they were thus torn a sunder, the death of a daughter long and slowly wasting away before his eyes, could be calmly born, but this blue was wholly unforeseen, and his chest heavily rose and fell, and by the bright fire night I saw tears rolling over his weather beaten cheeks, a child will wait, a bramble smart, a maid to see her sparrow part, a strutling for a woman's heart, taught not of grief, till thy has seen, the hard drawn tears of bearded men, the fury of this dorm being abated, I resolved to follow Stephen down to the shore, he was not in sight, and I knew not what direction to take, it was a glimmy night, the transient glimpses of the men between driving masses of clouds, only making the scene more wild and appalling, I could see the tops of the tall trees bending under the fury of the last, air it came to sweep the beach, the heaving bellows recovered with foam, far as the eye could see, and rising and tumbling seemed striving with each other as they rolled on towards the sands, I had seen storms upon the ocean before, but never had it presented so awful I'm majestic in appearance, as the bramble struck upon the shore and sent a huge mass of water upon the sands, their sullon roar mingled with the hiling and rushing of the wind and filled me with all, there were torches upon the beach, and as a dreamier I saw the fishermen run together to one point, the body had just been washed ashore and lay stretched upon the sands, the head was bare and long logs of white, air streamed down upon the shoulders, the heavy pee jacket was off from one arm as if he had endeavored to extricate himself from it in the water, the sinew e arms lay pyrnus and free from tension, then, but they told me that when they first drew him from the surf, both hands were grasping a broken or, with such strength that they were unable to miss his hold, to suddenly the muscles relaxed and the arms fell upon the ground, they turned the body and a little water ran from the mouth, then gently raising it upon their shoulders, they bore at home, and the Tupper 16, the old sealer by Ambeil's Abbott.","Short Stories, Essays & Short Works",English,01:47:30,LibriVox Volunteers,[],"['Assa Osborne', 'Stephen Covellong', 'Hattarra', 'Anne Wheels Abbott', 'Mother', 'Ike', 'Stephen Lee', 'Grancer', 'Stephen', 'Chad Horner', 'jerry black', 'Bali Claire', ""Aunt Lassie's"", 'William']","['Kankyantrum', 'Ireland', 'Northern Ireland']",[],1,1,2,0,9,5,0

Recording by Colling McMahon. Capture of a Clever Swingler. Sam Benard's unique method of defrauding the railroads. How he did the work, his conviction after a long chase. Between the years of 1870 and 1876, the railroads of this country had been swindled, time after time by some unknown person, changing the address on an invoice of goods after it had reached the railroad office. This was done on an order which purported to come from the firm which had shipped the goods. In February of 1876, a shipment of gentleman's dress goods was sent to AA, Alden and company of Franklin Pennsylvania by Brock and Winer of Buffalo. The consignment was valued at $721.19. A few minutes after the goods had been delivered at the freight office, a man entered and told the agent that the boxes had been marked with the name of the wrong town, that they should go to Cory Pennsylvania instead of Franklin. The agent demanded an order from the firm before making the change. The pretended clerk wrote out the order, signing the firm named to it, and the address Cory was substituted for that of Franklin. This being done, the supposed clerk went to Cory. He or he pretended that he was a merchant from New York, and that he was to open an auction store in the town. The merchant tailors did not like to have their trade injured in this manner, so they offered to buy the goods. The pretended merchant sold them at a much reduced price, and received a check for $359.60. He endorsed the check with AA Alden's name, thus adding forgery to his other crimes. Then the case was given to me. Two weeks went by without a clue to the swindler. I found that other detectives had been hunting for a man who had played the same game in other cities, but the culprit had guarded himself so well that even his real name was unknown. From the descriptions obtained, and from his general manner of operation, it was known that the same person had been operating on all the roads where this swindling had occurred. One day while in Buffalo, I chanced to go into a cigar store. At this time, the newspapers were full of the swindle, and some of the people in the store were discussing the affair. An old gentleman who was among those present said that a young man who had been employed in the same store with himself, about six years previously, swindled his employers in the same manner. This was in Rochester. I took the hint, and after questioning the old man, I found that the name of his former working companion was William Bernard. I went to Rochester, and while there obtained the names of some of his acquaintances, and finally found a photograph of him. The description given to me by the detectives, tallied with the photograph of Bernard. I therefore made up my mind that Bernard was the man that I wanted. After further inquiry, I found that relations of Bernard lived in Detroit, Michigan. I went there, and obtained information as to the whereabouts of the swindler. I followed him through Montreal, Canada, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Toledo, Chicago, to St. Louis. He was known in all these places as Jew Harry. It seemed that it was impossible to find a detective in any one place who had not at some time or other been on Bernard's tracks. On my arrival in St. Louis, June 26, 1876, I went to the office of Chief of Police, McDonald, Hugh at once. I told him who I was, and that I had information which led me to believe that Bernard had worked in St. Louis. When the chief, who was very portally, and someone grathed her this, he straightened up in his chair and said, That's impossible. That fellow would not dare to come to St. Louis. He would be afraid. He knows he could not work any such game in this town. My police would be sure to get him. I then told the chief that I had reason to believe that Bernard had been in St. Louis within the last few days. This idea, the chief, fairly ridiculed. Just at this moment, a rather elderly man entered the office in a very excited manner. He had brown hair, streaked with gray, and wore short sideburns or gollways as they are sometimes called. He asked if he could see the chief for a few minutes, so I once rose to leave the office. The chief told me to remain, then asked the visitor to state his business. He told the chief that his name was H.M. Smith, and that he was a pawnbroker in business at eighth in Morgan streets. He then went on to say that a man giving the name of Solomon, representing that he was from Cleveland, Ohio. Had caught on him a few days previous. He represented himself as a pawnbroker, and had presented the business card of Solomon and company of Cleveland. Mr. Smith told him that he knew of the firm, but never had the pleasure of meeting a member of it. Solomon then told Smith that he had a nephew who had been in business with him for years, but that he had gone out west in the mining district of Colorado, and opened up a pawnshop of his own. There was then a large demand for revolvers and pistols of heavy caliber, and that he had ordered about $2,000 worth of heavy caliber guns and ammunition from the Simmons hardware company of St. Louis. After he had placed the order with the request that it be packed and shipped immediately, he had received a telegram from his nephew, stating that he had gotten into trouble and had been forced to leave the country, and therefore could not take the order from Simmons. He requested Solomon to call it Simmons and cancel the order. The Simmons people informed Solomon that as the firearms were already packed and in the free house, preparatory for shipping, they could not cancel the order. Solomon then said, Dismith, I have no use for these pistols and guns, and I can't ship them to my nephew in Colorado since he is left there. I will have these goods brought up to your store and you can examine them. Then if you find them just as I have represented, I will let you have them at your own home. That you have them at your own price. You can easily sell them and make some money on them. Mr. Smith ascended. Solomon then went and got a German and had the firearms brought to Smith's office from the freight depot. Solomon got there about the time the goods did and had the case is opened. Smith found the goods were just as Solomon represented, so he told Solomon that he would give him $1100 for them, which was about half their value. Solomon with tears and his eyes accepted Smith's check for that amount and left for parts unknown. On the morning of my arrival and while I was talking to Chief McDonough, Smith had received by mail a bill for the goods from Simmons Hardware Company, which extended to him the privilege of discounting the bill and that upon making immediate payment he might deduct the usual percent. Whereupon, Mr. Smith called upon the Simmons Hardware Company and was there informed that a man resembling him very much had called there and selected a bill of goods and it also presented Smith's business card. They thought it was Mr. Smith and upon finding him all right formerly had unhesitatingly packed and shipped to the goods as directed. Smith and Bernard looked very much alike, wearing the same style of beard and having about the same complexion. Smith's description of Solomon, who has really been hard, was very accurate and finally wound up by saying that Solomon looked enough like him to be a younger brother. While Smith was telling the Chief this story, I was listening and when he began to describe Solomon, I asked the Chief if I might be permitted to ask Mr. Smith a few questions. More certainly, replied the Chief. Do you think I then said to Smith that you would know this man Solomon if you should see him again? Surely, answer Mr. Smith, I would know him anywhere. I then took Bernard's picture from my pocket and asked Smith if that resembled Solomon. He threw up his hands and exclaimed, why that is him? That's an excellent picture of him. I then turned to the Chief and said, Chief, it seems that Bernard was not afraid to come to St. Louis after all. I then got busy and learned that Bernard had left St. Louis over the Burlington and had gone to Quincy, Illinois a few days before my arrival. I then took the first train for Quincy. There, I learned a similar swindle with a case of goods shipped to Adina, Missouri. I left it once for Adina. There, the freight agent informed me that a man named Solomon, an answering to the description of Bernard, had called for a case of goods. But the agent who was a relative of the party to whom the goods had been originally consigned had refused to deliver them until presented with some identification. Just about this time, I received word that Solomon was walking out of town. I pursued him, arrested him and brought him back to town. At first, he denied everything, even his photograph, but finally consented to go with me when I brought out other proofs. I had once supplied for a requisition from the authorities. After the capture, Bernard and Adina by me, Bernard's lawyer insisted that he could not be taken to Pennsylvania, while he stood charged with a felony in Missouri. Therefore, when he made his plea, I telegraphed a friend in St. Louis to employ a good criminal lawyer and have him report to me at Adina. My friend employed Colonel Nat C. Clayborn of St. Louis. At the same time, I wired Mr. Smith to come up at once, or sent his son Sam to Adina for the purpose of identifying Solomon. In due time, both Sam Smith and Colonel Clayborn arrived in Adina. Colonel Clayborn was an old citizen and was well-known all over the state. He was acquainted with the judge of Knox County and had him convene a special term of court and in panel a special grand jury. I arranged to have witnesses appear before the grand jury, which immediately indicted Bernard for the Adina Swindle. Colonel Clayborn assisting the prosecuting attorney at Adina for the state. Bernard was convicted and sent to the penitentiary at Jefferson City, Missouri, for four years. I accompanied him to Jefferson City, where I procured a duplicate of the receipt for the body of Bernard from the warden of the Missouri penitentiary, and previously a certified copy of the proceedings at the trial and conviction in Knox County, which I turned over to the officers of the Allegheny Valley Railroad on my return to Pittsburgh. This satisfied them, but not so well as if I had extradited Bernard and brought him back to Pennsylvania for trial. I omitted to say that on the night that Sam Smith arrived in Adina from St. Louis, that the small hotel was filled overflowing, and the landlord was obliged to assign Smith to my room, which was in the front of the second story just over the office. Not 10 o'clock that night, just as Smith and I had retired to our room, preparatory to turning in for the night, a shower of missile such as rocks, stones, and pistol shots were fired through the window of our room from the opposite side of the street. Upon investigation, I found that Bernard had enlisted the cooperation of some sympathizers, through a lawyer in the town whom he had employed to defend him. And at the instance of whom this mob was formed, with a view to frighten and ink Smith and myself and the other witnesses who were to appear in the case out of town. We were so badly frightened that we did not leave town until Bernard had been tried and convicted, and when we left Bernard left with us.

Chapter 1 of ideas in general and their original. 1. Every man being conscious to himself that he thinks and that which his mind is applied about whilst thinking, being the ideas that are there. It is passed doubt that men have in their minds several ideas, such as those expressed by the words whiteness, hardness, sweetness, thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and others. It is in the first place then to be inquired how he comes by them. I know it is a received doctor that men have native ideas and original characters stamped upon their minds in their very first being. This opinion I have at large examined already and I suppose what I have said in the foregoing book will be much more easily admitted when I have shown, once the understanding may get all the ideas it has and by what ways and degrees they may come into the mind, for which I shall appeal to everyone's own observation and experience. 2. Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters without any ideas. How comes it to be furnished? Since comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety. Once has it all the materials of reason and knowledge. To this I answer in one word, from experience. In all that our knowledge is founded and from that it ultimately derives itself. Our observation employed either upon external sensible objects or about the internal operations of our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves is that which supplies our understandings with all the materials of thinking. These two are the fountains of knowledge from once all the ideas we have or can naturally have do spring. 3. First are senses conversant about particular sensible objects to convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things. According to those various ways, we're in those objects to affect them. And thus we come by those ideas we have. Of yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities. Which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean they from external objects convey into the mind what produces their those perceptions. This great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our senses and derived by them to the understanding I call sensation. 4. Secondly, the other fountain, the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas, is the perception of the operations of our own mind within us. As it is employed about the ideas it has got, which operations when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, which could not be had from things without and such are perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different actings of our own minds which we be in conscious of and observing in ourselves, do from these receive into our understanding as distinct ideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas every man has wholly in himself, and though it be not sense as having nothing to do with external objects yet it is very like it and might properly enough be called internal sense. But as I call the other sensation, so I call this reflection. The idea is it of words, being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean that notice which the mind takes of its own operations and the manner of them. By reason we're of, there comes to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. These two, I say, namely external material things as the objects of sensation and the operations of our own minds within as the objects of reflection are to me, the only originals from whens all our ideas take their beginnings. The term operations here I use in a large sense as comprehending not barely the actions of the mind about its ideas, but some sort of passions arising sometimes from them, such as in the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought. 5. The understanding seems to me not to have the least glimmering of any ideas which it doff not receive from one of these two. External objects furnish the mind with the ideas of sensible qualities which are all those different perceptions they produce in us, and the mind furnishes the understanding with ideas of its own operations. These, when we have taken a full survey of them in their several modes, combinations, and relations, we shall find to contain all our whole stock of ideas, and that we have nothing in our minds which did not come in one of these two ways. And anyone examine his own thoughts and thoroughly search into his understanding, and then let him tell me whether all the original ideas he has there are any other than of the objects of his senses, or of the operations of his mind considered as objects of his reflection, and how great a massive knowledge so ever he imagines to be lodged there, he will upon taking a strict view see that he has not any idea in his mind, but want one of these two have imprinted, though perhaps with infinite variety compounded and enlarged by the understanding as we shall see hereafter. 6. He that attentively considers the observable state of a child at his first coming into the world will have little reason to think him stored with plenty of ideas that are to be the matter of his future knowledge. It is by de greasy comes to be furnished with them, and though the ideas of obvious and familiar qualities in print themselves, before memory begins to keep a register of time or order, yet it is often so late before someone usual qualities come in the way that there are few men that cannot recollect the beginning of their acquaintance with them, and if it were worthwhile, no doubt a child might be so ordered as to have but a very few even of the ordinary ideas, till he were grown up to a man. But all that are born into the world being surrounded with bodies that perpetually and diversely affect them, variety of ideas, whether care be taken of it or no, are imprinted on the minds of children. White and colors are busy at hand everywhere when the eyes but open. Sounds in some tangible qualities fail not to solicit their proper senses, and force an entrance to the mind. But yet I think it will be granted easily that if a child were kept in a place where he never saw any other but black and white till he were a man, he would have no more ideas of scarlet or green than he that from his childhood never tasted an oyster or a pineapple has of those particular relishes. 7. Men then come to be furnished with fewer or more simple ideas from without, according as the objects they converse with a Ford, greater or less variety, and from the operations of their minds within, according as they more or less reflect on them. Or though he that contemplates the operations of his mind cannot but have plain and clear ideas of them. Yet unless he turns his thoughts that way and considers them attentively, he will no more have clear and distinct ideas of all the operations of his mind and all that may be observed therein, then he will have all the particular ideas of any landscape or of the parts and motions of a clock who will not turn his eyes to it, and with attention he'd all the parts of it. The picture or clock may be so placed that they may come in his way every day, but yet he will have but a confused idea of all the parts they are made up of till he applies himself with attention to consider them each in particular. 8. And hence we see the reason why it is pretty late before most children get ideas of the operations of their own minds, and some have not any very clear or perfect ideas of the greatest part of them all their lives, because though they pass their continually, yet like floating visions, they make not deep impressions enough to leave in their minds clear, distinct, lasting ideas, till the understanding turns inward upon itself, reflects on its own operations and makes them the objects of its own contemplation. Children, when they come first into it, are surrounded with a world of new things, which by a constant solicitation of their senses, draw the mind constantly to them, for word to take notice of new, and apt to be delighted with the variety of changing objects. Thus the first years are usually employed and diverting in looking abroad. Men's business in them is to accoint themselves with what is to be found without, and so growing up in a constant attention to outward sensation, seldom make any considerable reflection on what passes within them, till they come to be of right-beer years and some scarce ever at all. 9. To ask at what time a man has first any ideas is to ask when he begins to perceive, having ideas and perception being the same thing. I know it is an opinion that the soul always thinks, and that it has the actual perception of ideas in itself constantly as long as it exists, and that actual thinking is as inseparable from the soul as actual extension is from the body, which if true to inquire after the beginning of a man's ideas is the same as to inquire after the beginning of his soul. Or by this account, soul in its ideas, as body and its extension will begin to exist both at the same time. 10. But whether the soul be supposed to exist at the seeding two, or co-evil with, or sometime after, the first rudiments of organization were the beginnings of life in the body. I leave to be disputed by those who have better thought of that matter. I confess myself to have one of those dull souls that do not perceive itself always to contemplate ideas. Nor can conceive it any more necessary for the soul always to think than for the body, always to move. The perception of ideas being, as I conceive, to the soul, what motion is to the body. Not its essence, but one of its operations. And therefore, though thinking be supposed to ever so much the proper action of the soul, yet it is not necessary to suppose that it should be always thinking, always in action. That perhaps is the privilege of the infinite author and preserver of things who never slumber nor sleeps, but it is not competent to any finite being, at least not to the soul of man. We know certainly by experience that we sometimes think and then draw this infallible consequence that there is something in us that has a power to think. But whether that substance perpetually thinks or no, we can be no farther assured than experience and forms us. For to say that actual thinking is essential to the soul and inseparable from it is to beg what is in question and not to prove it by reason, which is necessary to be done if it be not a self-evident proposition. But whether this, that the soul always thinks, be a self-evident proposition that everybody ascends to it first hearing, I appeal to mankind. It is doubted whether I thought at all last night or no, the question being about a matter of fact, it is begging it to bring as a proof for it and hypothesis, which is the very thing in dispute by which one may prove anything, and it is but supposing that all watches whilst the balance beats think, and it is sufficiently proved and passed out that my watch thought all last night. But he that would not deceive himself ought to build his hypothesis on matter of fact, make it out by sensible experience and not presume on matter of fact because of his hypothesis. That is, because he supposes it to be so, which way of proving amounts to this, that I must necessarily think all last night because another supposed is that I always think, though I myself cannot perceive that I always do so. But men in love with their opinions may not only suppose what is in question, but a ledge wrong matter of fact. How else could any man make it an inference of mine that a thing is not because we are not sensible of it in our sleep? I do not say there is no soul in a man, because he is not sensible of it in his sleep. But I do say, he cannot think at any time waking or sleeping without being sensible of it. Now or being sensible of it is not necessary to anything, but to our thoughts and to them it is, and to them it will always be necessary till we can think without being conscious of it. 11. I grant that the soul in awakeing man is never without thought, because it is the condition of being awake. But whether sleeping without dreaming be not an affection of the whole man, mind as well as body, maybe worth a waking man's consideration, it being hard to conceive that anything should think and not be conscious of it. If the soul does think in a sleeping man without being conscious of it, I ask whether during such thinking it has any pleasure or pain or be capable of happiness or misery. I am sure the man is not, any more than the bed or earth he lies on. For to be happy or miserable without being conscious of it seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible. Or if it be possible that the soul can whilst the body is sleeping have its thinking in joints and concerns, its pleasure or pain apart, which the man is not conscious of nor partakes in, it is certain that socrates asleep. And socrates awake is not the same person. But his soul when he sleeps and socrates the man, consisting of body and soul when he is waking. Our two persons, since waking socrates, has no knowledge of or concernment for that happiness or misery of his soul, which it enjoys alone by itself whilst he sleeps without perceiving anything of it. And more than he has for the happiness or misery of a man in the Indies whom he knows not. For if we take holy away all consciousness of our actions and sensations, especially of pleasure and pain and the concern meant that accompanies it, it will be hard to know where into place personal identity. 12. The soul-during sound sleep thinks, says these men. Whilst it thinks and perceives, it is capable, certainly, if those of the lighter trouble as well as any other perceptions and it must necessarily be conscious of its own perceptions. But it has all this apart. The sleeping man it is plain, is conscious of nothing of all this. Let us suppose then the soul of castor, while he is sleeping, retired from his body, which is no impossible supposition for the men I have here to do with, who so liberally allow life without a thinking soul to all other animals. These men cannot then judge it impossible or a contradiction that the body should live without the soul. Nor that the soul should subsist and think or have perception, even perception of happiness or misery, without the body. Let us then as I say suppose the soul of castors separated during his sleep from his body to think apart. Let us suppose two that it chooses for it's scene of thinking, the body of another man, for example, Pollux, who is sleeping without a soul. For if castor's soul can think, whilst castor is asleep, what castor is never conscious of, it is no matter what place it chooses to think in, we have here then the bodies of two men with only one soul between them, which we will suppose to sleep and wake by turns, and the soul still thinking in the waking man, or of the sleeping man is never conscious, has never the least perception. I ask then whether castor and Pollux, thus with only one soul between them, which thinks and perceives in one what the other is never conscious of, nor is concerned for, are not two as distinct persons as castor and hercules, or as socrates and Plato were, and whether one of them might not be very happy and the other very miserable, just by the same reason they make the soul in the man two persons who make the soul think apart what the man is not conscious of. Or I suppose nobody will make identity of person to consist in the souls being united, to the very same numerical particles of matter. For if that be necessary to identity, it will be impossible in that constant flux of the particles of our bodies, that any man should be the same person two days or two moments together. 13. Thus, me thinks every drowsy nod shakes their doctrine, who teach that the soul is always thinking. Those at least who do at any time sleep without dreaming can never be convinced, that their thoughts are sometimes four-four hours busy without their knowing of it, and if they are taken in the very act, waked in the middle of that sleeping contemplation, can give no manner of account of it. 14. It will perhaps be said, that the soul thinks even in the soundest sleep, but the memory retains it not. That the soul of a sleeping man should be at this moment busy at thinking, and the next moment in a waking man not remember nor be able to recollect one jot of all those thoughts is very hard to be conceived, and would need some better proof than bare assertion to make it be believed. Or who can without any more ado, but being barely told so, imagine that the greatest part of men do during all their lives for several hours every day think of something, which, if they were asked, even in the middle of these thoughts, they could remember nothing at all of. Most men, I think, pass a great part of their sleep without dreaming. I once knew a man that was bread a scholar and had no bad memory, who told me he had never dreamed in his life, till he had that fever he was then newly recovered of, which was about the five or six and twenty-eighth year of his age. I suppose the world affords more such instances, at least everyone's acquaintance will furnish him with examples enough of such as past, most of their nights without dreaming. 15. To think often and never to retain it so much as one moment is a very useless sort of thinking, and the soul in such a state of thinking does very little if at all, excel that of a looking glass, which constantly receives variety of images or ideas, but retains none. They disappear and vanish, and there remain no footsteps of them. The looking glass is never the better for such ideas, nor the soul for such thoughts. Perhaps it will be said, that, in a waking man, the materials of the body are employed, and make you soven thinking, in that the memory of thoughts is retained by the impressions that are made on the brain, and the traces there left after such thinking, but that in the thinking of the soul which is not perceived in a sleeping man, there the soul thinks apart, and making no use of the organs of the body, the Eve's no impressions on it, and consequently no memory of such thoughts. Not to mention again the absurdity of two distinct persons which follows from this supposition, I answer farther, that whatever ideas the mind can receive and contemplate without the help of the body, it is reasonable to conclude that can retain without the help of the body, too, or else the soul, or any separate spirit, will have but little advantage by thinking. If it has no memory, if it's own thoughts, if it cannot lay them up forward so in use, and be able to recall them upon occasion, if it cannot reflect upon what is past and make use of its former experiences, reasonings and contemplations, to what purpose does it think. They who make the soul a thinking thing at this rate will not make it a much more noble thing, than those do whom they condemn for allowing it to be nothing but the subtlest parts of matter. Characters drawn on dust that the first breath of wind e-faces, or impressions made on a heap of atoms or animal spirits, are altogether as useful and rendered as subject as noble as the thoughts of a soul that perish in thinking, that once out of sight are gone forever and leave no memory of themselves behind them. Nature never makes excellent things for a mean or no uses, and it is hardly to be conceived that our infinitely wise creator should make so admirable a faculty as the power of thinking. That faculty which comes nearest the excellency of his own incomprehensible being, to be so idle and uselessly employed, at least a fourth part of its time here, as to think constantly without remembering any of those thoughts, without doing any good to itself or others, or being any way useful to any other part of the creation. If we will examine it, we will not find I suppose the motion of dull and senseless matter, anywhere in the universe, made so little use of, and so wholly thrown away. 16. It is true we have sometimes instances of perception whilst we are asleep, and retain the memory of those thoughts, but how extravagant and incoherent for the most part they are, how little conformable to the perfection and order of irrational being, those who are acquainted with dreams need not be told. This I would willingly be satisfied in. Whether the soul, when it thinks thus apart, and as it were separate from the body, acts less rationally than when conjointly with it or no. If it's separate thoughts be less rational, then these men must say that the soul owes the perfection of rational thinking to the body. If it does not, it is wonder that our dreams should be for the most part so frivolous and irrational, and that the soul should retain none of its more rational saliliquies and meditations. 17. Those who so confidently tell us that the soul always actually thinks, I would, that they would also tell us what those ideas are that are in the soul of a child. Before, or just at the union of the body, before it had received any by sensation. The dreams of sleeping men are, as I take it, all made up of the waking man's ideas, low for the most part oddly put together. It is strange if the soul has ideas of its own, that it derives not from sensation or reflection, if it thought before it received any impressions from the body, that it should never in its private thinking, so private that the man himself perceives it not, retain any of them. At the very moment, it wakes out of them, and then makes the man glad with new discoveries. Who can find it reasonable that the soul should, in its retirement during sleep, have so many hours, thoughts, and yet never light on any of those ideas at borrowed, not from sensation or reflection, or at least preserve the memory of none but such, which being occasioned from the body must need to be less natural to a spirit. It is strange the soul should never once in a man's whole life recall over any of its pure native thoughts, and those ideas it had before borrowed anything from the body. Never bring into the waking man's view, any other ideas, but what have a tang of the cask and manifestly derive their original from that union? If it always thinks, and so had ideas before it was united, or before it received any from the body, it is not to be supposed, but that during sleep it recollects its native ideas, and during that retirement from communicating with the body, whilst it thinks by itself, the ideas it is busy about should be, sometimes at least, those more natural and congenial ones which it had in itself, undereived from the body, or its own operations about them. Each since the waking man never remembers, we must, from this hypothesis conclude, either that the soul remembers something that the man does not, or else that memory belongs only to such ideas as our derived from the body, or the mind's operations about them. 18. I would be glad also to learn from these men who so confidently pronounce that the human soul, or which is all one, that a man always thinks, how they come to know it, nay, how they come to know that they themselves think, when they themselves do not perceive it. This I am afraid is to be sure without proofs, and to know without perceiving. It is, I suspect, a confused notion taken up to serve and hypothesis, and none of those clear truths that either their own evidence forces us to admit, or common experience makes it imprudence to deny. For the most that can be said of it is this, that it is impossible, the soul may always think, but not always retain it in memory, and I say it is as possible that the soul may not always think, and much more probable that it should sometimes not think, then that it should often think, and that, along while together, and not be conscious to itself the next moment after that it had thought. 19. To suppose the soul to think, and the man not to perceive it, is, as has been said, to make two persons in one man, and if one considers well these men's way of speaking, one should be led into a suspicion that they do so. For they who tell us that the soul always thinks do never that I remember, say that a man always thinks. Can the soul think and not the man, or a man think and not be conscious of it? This perhaps would be suspected of jargon and others. If they say, the man thinks always, but is not always conscious of it, they may as well say, his body is extended without having parts. For it is altogether is intelligible to say that a body is extended without parts, as that anything thinks without being conscious of it, or perceiving that it does so. They who talk thus may, with as much reason, if it be necessary to their hypothesis, say that a man is always hungry, but that he does not always feel it, whereas hunger consists in that very sensation, as thinking, consists in being conscious that one thinks. If they say that a man is always conscious to himself of thinking, I ask, how they know it? Consciousness is the perception of what passes in man's own mind. Can another man perceive that I am conscious of anything, when I perceive it not myself? All man's knowledge here can go beyond his experience. Wake a man out of a sound sleep and ask him, what he was that moment thinking of. If he himself be conscious of nothing he then thought on, he must be a notable diviner of thoughts that can assure him that he was thinking, may he not with more reason, assure him he was not asleep? This is something beyond philosophy, and it cannot be less than revelation that discovers to another thoughts in my mind when I can find none there myself. And they must need to have a penetrating sight who can certainly see that I think, when I cannot perceive it myself, and when I declare that I do not, and yet can see that dogs or elephants do not think, when they give all the demonstration of it imaginable, except only telling us that they do so. This some may suspect to be a step beyond the rose accrucians. It is seeming easier to make one self invisible to others than to make another's thoughts visible to me, which are not visible to himself. But it is but defining the soul to be a substance that always thinks, and the business is done. If such definition be of any authority I know not what it can serve for, but to make many men suspect that they have no souls at all. Since they find a good part of their lives, pass away without thinking. For no definitions that I know, no suppositions of any sect, are a force enough to destroy constant experience, and perhaps it is the affectation of knowing beyond what we perceive, that makes so much useless dispute and noise in the world. 20. I see no reason therefore to believe that the soul thinks before the senses have furnished it with ideas to think on, and as those are increased and retained, so it comes by exercise to improve its faculty of thinking in the several parts of it, as well as afterwards, by compounding those ideas and reflecting on its own operations, it increases its stock as well as facility, in remembering, imagining, reasoning, and other modes of thinking. 21. He that will suffer himself to be informed by observation and experience and not make his own hypothesis the rule of nature. We'll find few signs of a soul accustomed to much thinking in a newborn child and much fewer of any reasoning at all, and yet it is hard to imagine that the rational soul should think so much and not reason at all. And he that will consider that infants newly come into the world, spend the greatest part of their time and sleep, and are seldom awake, but when either hunger calls for the teeth, or some pain, the most important at-of-all sensations, or some other violent impression upon the body forces the mind to perceive and attend to it, he I say who considers this will perhaps find reason to imagine that a fetus in the mother's womb differs not much from the state of a vegetable, but passes the greatest part of its time without perception or thought, doing very little, in a place where it needs not ask for food and is surrounded by liquor, always equally soft and near of the same temper, where the eyes have no light, and the ears so shut up and not very susceptible of sounds, and where there is little or no variety or change of objects to move the senses. 22. Follow a child from its birth and observe the alterations that time makes, and you shall find as the mind by the senses comes more and more to be furnished with ideas, it comes to be more and more awake, thinks more, the more it has matter to think on. After some time it begins to know the objects which being most familiar with it have made lasting impressions. Thus it comes by degrees to know the person's daily conversation with, and distinguishes them from strangers, which are instances and effects if it's coming to retain and distinguish the ideas the senses convey to it, and so we may observe how the mind by degrees improves in these and advances to the exercise of those other faculties of enlarging, compounding and obstructing his ideas, and of reasoning about them, and reflecting upon all these, of which I shall have occasion to speak more hereafter. 23. If it shall be demanded then, when a man begins to have any ideas, I think the true answer is, when he first has any sensation. For since there appear not to be any ideas in the mind before the senses have conveyed any in, I conceive that ideas in the understanding our co-evil with sensation, which is such an impression or motion made in some part of the body as produces some perception in the understanding. It is about these impressions made on our senses by outward objects that the mind seems first to employ itself in such operations as we call perception, remembering, consideration, reasoning, and etc. 24. In time, the mind comes to reflect on its own operations about the ideas got by sensation, and thereby stores itself with a new set of ideas, which I call ideas of reflection. These are the impressions that are made on our senses by outward objects that are extrinsical to the mind and its own operations, proceeding from powers in trinical and proper to itself, which when reflected on by itself become also objects of its contemplation, are, as I have said, the original of all knowledge. Thus the first capacity of human intellect is that the mind is fitted to receive the impressions made on it, either through the senses by outward objects or by its own operations when it reflects on them. This is the first step a man makes towards the discovery of anything, and the ground work were on to build all those notions which ever he shall have naturally in this world. All those sublime thoughts which tower above the clouds and reaches high as heaven itself take their rise and footing here. In all that good extent were in the mind wanders in those remote speculations, it may seem to be elevated with, its stirs not one jot beyond those ideas, which sense or reflection have offered for its contemplation. 25. In this part, the understanding is merely passive, and whether or no it will have these beginnings and as it were, the terials of knowledge is not in its own power. For the objects of our senses do many of them uptrue their particular ideas upon our minds, whether we will or no. And the operations of our minds will not let us be without, at least some obscure notions of them. No man can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks. These simple ideas when offered to the mind, the understanding can no more refuse to have nor alter when they are imprinted nor blot them out and make new ones itself. Then a mirror can refuse alter or obliterate the images or ideas which the objects set before it do their in produce. As the bodies that surround us do diversely affect our organs, the mind is forced to receive the impressions and cannot avoid the perception of those ideas that are next to them.

It was a bitterly cold and frosty morning towards the end of the winter of 97, that I was awakened by tugging at my shoulder. It was Holmes. The candle in his hand shone upon his eager stooping face, and told me I had a glance that something was a miss. Come, what's it come? He cried. The game is a foot. Not a word. Into your clothes and come. Ten minutes later we were both in a cab, and rattleing through the silent streets on a way to charing cross-station. The first faint winter's dawn was beginning to appear, and we could divnly see the occasional figure of an early workman, as he fastens, blurred and indistinct in the offerless and London wreak. Holmes dusted in silence into his heavy coat, and I was glad to do the same, for the air was most bitter, and neither of us had broken our fast. It was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station, and taken our places in the Kentish train that we were sufficiently thought. He to speak, and I to listen. Holmes drew a note from his pocket and read aloud. Every grain's marsham Kent, 330 AM, my dear Mr. Holmes. I should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to be a most remarkable case. It is something quite in your line. Except for releasing the lady, I will see that everything is kept exactly as I have found it. But I beg you not to lose an incident, as it is difficult to leave, so useless there. Yours faithfully, Stanley Hopkins. Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion his summons has been entirely justified, said Holmes. I fancied as every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and I must admit Watson that you have some power of selection, which are tones for much of which I deflor in your narratives. Your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story, instead of a scientific exercise, has ruined what might have been an instructive and even classical series of demonstrations. You slur over work of the atmosphere's finesse and delicacy, in order to develop on sensational details, which may excite, but cannot possibly instruct the reader. Why do not write them yourself, I said with some business. I will, my dear Watson, I will, at present I am, as you know, fairly busy, but I propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a textbook, which you are focused to hold art of detection into one volume. Now present research appears to be a case of murder. You think this so useless is dead then? I should say so, Hopkins writing shows considerable agitation, and he is not an emotional man. Yes, I gather there has been visance, and that the body is left for our inspection. A mere suicide would not have caused him to send for me. As to the release of the lady, it would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy. We are moving in high life, Watson, crackling paper, E B. Monogram, coat of arms, picture as address. I think that friend Hopkins will live up to his reputation, and we shall have an interesting morning. The crime was committed before 12 last night. How can you possibly tell, by an inspection of the trains and by reckoning the time? The local fleas had to be called in, they had to communicate with Scotland Yard, Hopkins had to go out, and he in turn had to send for me, all that makes a fair night's work. Well, here we are at Chiselhurt Station, and we shall soon set out doubts at rest. It arrived over a couple of miles through narrow country lanes, brought us to a farbgate, which was open for us by an old lodgkeeper, whose Haggard faced for the reflection of some great disaster. The avenue ran through a noble park between lines of ancient Elm's, and ended in a low widespread house, pillar in front after the fashion of Paladia. The central far was evidently of a great age, and shrouded in ivy, but the large windows showed that modern changes had been carried out, and one winger the house appeared to be entirely new. The useful figure and alert eager face of Inspector Stanley Hopkins confronted us in the open doorway. I'm very glad you have come, Mr. Holmes, and you too, Dr. Watson. But indeed, if I had my time over again, I should not have troubled you, since the lady has come to herself, she has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do. You remember that Lewisham gang of furglers. What, the three randles? Exactly, the father and two sons, it's their work. I have no doubt of it. They did a job at Siddenham a fortnight ago, and was seen and described. Rather cool to do another so soon, and so near, but it is they beyond all doubt. It's a hanging matter this time. So used as his dead then. Yes, his head was knocked in with his own poker. So used as Brackenstall, the driver tells me. Exactly, one of the richest men in Kent, Lady Brackenstall, is in the morning room. Poor Lady. She has had a most dreadful experience. She seemed half dead when I saw her first. I think you had vests see her, and hear her account of facts. Then we will examine the dining room together. Lady Brackenstall was no ordinary person. Seldom have I seen so graceful of figure, so womanly a presence, and so beautiful of face. She was of lond, golden hair, blue eyeed. I would no doubt have had the perfect complexion which goes with such colouring, had not her recent experience left her drawn and haggard. Her sufferings were physical as well as mental for over one eye rose a hideous, plum coloured swelling which her made a tall, a stear woman was bathing acidiously with vinegar and water. The Lady lay back exhausted upon account, but her quick, observant gaze as we entered the room, and the alert expression of her beautiful features showed that neither her whits nor her courage had been shaken by her terrible experience. She was enveloped in a loose dressing gown of blue and silver, but a black sequing covered dinner dress lay upon the couch beside her. I have told you all that happened, Mr. Hopkins, she said weirdly, could you not repeat it for me? Well, if you think it necessary, I will tell you, gentlemen, what occurred. Have they been in the dining room yet? I thought they had better hear your Ladyship story first. I should be glad when you can arrange matters. It is horrible to me to think of him still lying there. She shudded and buried her face in her hands, as she did so the loose gown fell back from her forearms. Holmes utter the next remation. You have other injuries, Madam. What is this? Two vivid red spots stood out on one of the white round limbs. She hastily covered it. It is nothing. It has no connection with this hideous business tonight. If you and your friend will sit down, I will tell you all I can. I have the wife a surge used as Brackenstall, have been buried about a year. I suppose that it is no use, my tempted to conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one. I fear that all our neighbours would tell you that, even if I were to attempt to deny it. Perhaps the fault may be part of your mind. I was brought up in the freer, less conventional atmosphere of South Australia, and this English life, with its proprietors and its primness, is not congenial to me. But the main reason lies in the one fact, which is notorious to everyone, and that is that so useless was a confirmed runkered. To be with such a man for an hour is unpleasant. Can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and highly spiritual woman, to be tied to him for day and night? It is a sacrilege, a crime, a villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding. I say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the land. God will not let such wickedness endure. For instance, she sat out per cheeks flushed, and her eyes blazing from under the terrible mark upon her brow. Then the strong soothing hand of the austere may drew her head down onto the cushion, and the wild anger died away into fashion at sobbing. At last she continued. I will tell you about last night, you are aware, perhaps, that in this house all the servants sleep in the modern wing. The central block is made up of the dwelling rooms, with a kitchen behind an hour bedroom above. My maid, Theresa, sleeps above my room. There is no one else, and no sound could alarm those who are in the father wing. This must have been well known to the robbers, or they would not have acted as they did. So useless retired about half-assed ten. The servants had already gone to their quarters. Only my maid was off, and she had remained in her room at the top of the house until I needed her services. I sat until after eleven in this room, absorbed in a book. Then I walked around to see that all was right before I went upstairs. It was my custom to do this myself for, as I have explained, so useless was not always to be trusted. I went into the kitchen, devout the pantry, the gunroom, the vineyard room, the drawing room, and finally the dining room. As I approached the window, which was covered with thick curtains, I suddenly felt the wind blow of on my face, and realized that it was open. I flung the curtain aside, and found myself face to face, with a broad shoulder to elderly man, who had just stepped into the room. The window is a long French one, which really formed a door leading to the lawn. I held my bedroom candle, lit in my hand, and, but I had its light, behind the first man, I saw two others, who were in the act of entering. I stepped back, but the fellow was on me, in an instant. He caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat. I ever my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. I must have been unconscious for a few minutes, but when I came to myself, I found that they had torn down the velrope, and had secured me tightly to the open chair, which stands at the head of the dining table. I was so firmly found that I could not move, and the handcatcher ran my mouth prevented me from uttering a sound. It was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room. It evidently heard Sonsus' wishes sounds, and he came from far from such a scene as he found. He was dressed in night shirt and trousers, with his favourite black-thorn casual in his hand. He rushed at the verglise, but another, it was an elderly man, stooped, picked the folk at out of the grate, and struck him a horrible blow as he fast. He fell with a grown and never moved again. I fented once more, but again it could only have been for a very few minutes, doing which I was insensible. When I opened my eyes I found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there. Each of them had a glass in his hand. I've already told you, have I not, that one was elderly, with a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. They might have been a father, with his two sons, they talked together in whispers. Then they came over and made sure I was securely bound, finally they withdrew, closing the window after them. It was quite a quadruan now before I got my mouth free. When I did so my screened fraught the maid to my assistants. The other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent for the local police, who instantly communicated with London. That is really all I can tell you gentlemen, and I trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again. Any questions Mr. Holmes asked Hopkins? I will not impose any further tax upon Lady Rackenstall's patience and time. Said Holmes. Before I go into the dining room, I should like to hear your experience he looked at the maid. I saw the men before ever they came into the house, said she. As I sat by my bedroom window, I saw three men in the moonlight, down by the lodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it at the time. It was more than an hour after I heard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to find her poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the floor, with his blood and brains over the room. It was enough to drive a woman out of her wits, tied there, and her very dress spotted with him. But she never wanted courage, did Miss Mary Fraser of Adelaide, and Lady Brackenstall of Abbey Grange, hasn't learnt new ways. You questioned her long enough, you gentlemen, and now she is coming to her own room, just with her old Theresa, to get the rest that she badly needs. With a motherly tenderness the gauntwoman put her arm round her mistress and let her from the room. She has been with her all her life, said Hopkins, nurse to Asavabee, and came with her to England when they first left Australia 18 months ago. Theresa writers her name, and the kind of maid you don't pick out nowadays. This way, Mr Holmes, if you please, the keen interest had fastened a hold as expressive face, and I knew that, with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed, there still remained an arrest of the affected, but what were these commonplace roads that he should saw his hands with them? And a truth and learned specialist who finds it has been called in for a case of measles, what it's feeling something of the annoyance which I read in my friends eyes. Yet the scene in the dining room of the Abbey Grange was sufficiently strange for a rest his attention and to recall his wading interest. It was a very large and high chamber with carved oak ceiling, oak fumbling, and a final ray of dearest heads and ancient weapons around the walls. At the farther end from the door was the high French window of which we had heard. Three smaller windows on the right hand side filled your apartment with cold winter sunshine. On the left was a large deep fireplace with a massive overhanging oak mantelpiece. Beside the fireplace was a heavy oak and chair with arms and crossfires at the bottom. In and out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord which was secured at each side to the crosspiece below. In releasing the lady, the cord had been slept off her, but the knots with which it had been secured still remained. These details only struck out tension afterwards, for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible object which lay upon the tiger-skin-hathrug in front of the fire. It was the body of a tall well-made man, about 40 years of age. He lay upon his back, his face upturned, and his white teeth grinning through his short black beard. His two clenched hands were raised above his head, and a heavy black-thorn-stick lay across them. His dark handsome aqualine features were convulsed into a phasem of addictive hatred which had set his dead face in a terribly-themed-ish expression. He'd evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out for he wore a foffish, embroidered night-shirt, and his bare feet projected from his trousers. His head was horribly injured, and the whole room bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down. Beside him lay the heavy-foker, bent into a curve by the concussion. Holmes examined both it, and the indescribable wreck which it had wrought. He must be a powerful man, this elder Randall he remarked. Yes, at Hopkins, I have some record of the fellow, and he is a rough customer. He should have no difficulty in getting him. Not the slightest, we've been on the look out for him, and there was some idea that he had got away to America. Now that we know that the gang I hear, I don't see how they can escape. We have the news at every seaport already, and the reward will be offered before evening. What feats me is how they could have done so mad a thing, knowing that the lady could describe them, and that we would not fail to recognise a description. Exactly, one would have expected that they would silence lady-brackenstall as well. They may not have realised, I suggested, that she had recovered from her faint. That is likely enough. If she seemed to be sentless, they would not take her life. What about this poor fellow, Hopkins? I seem to have heard some queer stories about him. He was a good-hearted man when he was sober, but a perfect fiend when he was drunk, or rather when he was half drunk, for he seldom really went the whole way. The devil seemed to be in him at such times, and he was capable of anything. From what I hear, in spite of all his wealth and his title, he very nearly came our way once or twice. There was a scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum, and setting it on fire, her lady-ship's dog, to make them at a worse, and that was only hash-started with difficulty. Then he threw a decanter at the maid to raise a right. There was trouble about that. On the whole, and between ourselves, it will be a brighter house without him. What are you looking at now? Holmes was down on his knees, examining with greater tension and knots, upon the red cord, with which the lady had been secured. Then he carefully scrutinised the broken and frayed-end, where it had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down. When this was fooled down, the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly, he remarked. No one could hear it, the kitchen stands right at the back of the house. How did the burglar know no one would hear it? How dare he full of the bell-rope in that reckless fashion? Exactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly. You've put the very question which I've asked myself again, and again. There could be no doubt that this fellow must have known the house and its habits. He must have perfectly understood that the servant would all be in bed at that comparatively early hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the kitchen. Therefore he must have been in close league with one of the servants. Surely that is evident, but there are eight servants and all of good character. Other things being equal said Holmes, one would suspect the one, at whose head the master through a detenter. And yet that would involve treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted. Well, the point is a minor one, and when you have randle, you will probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice. The latest story certainly seems to be corroborated, if it needed corroboration by every detail which we see before us. He walked to the fence window and threw it open. There are no signs here, but the ground is iron hard, and one would not expect them. I see that these candles in the mantelpiece have been lighted. Yes, it was by their light, and that of the ladies bedroom candle that the burglar saw their way about. And what did they take? Well, they did not take much. Only a half dozen articles of place off the cyborg, lady brackets two things that they were themselves so disturbed by the death was so useless, that they did not rancide the house, as they would otherwise have done. No doubt that is true, and yet they drank some wine, I understand? To steady their nerves. Exactly. D-3 glasses upon the cyborg have been untouched, I suppose. Yes, under bottle stands as they left it. Let us look at it, and learn, and learn what is this. The three glasses were grouped together, all of them tinge with wine, and one of them containing some dregs of beeswing. The bottle stood near them two thirds full, and recited lay a long, deeply stained cork. It's a parent's and the duster for the bottle, showed that it was no common vintage which the murderer has had enjoyed. A change had come over Holmes's manner. He had lost his listless expression, and again, I saw an alert light of interest in his keen deep set eyes. He raised a cork and examined it, mine utely. How did they draw it? He asked. Hopkins flooded to a half open draw, in it they some table linen and a large cork screw. Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was used? No, you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened. Quite so. As a matter of fact, that screw was not used. This bottle was opened by a pocket screw, probably contained in a knife, and not more than an inch and a half long. If you will examine the top of the cork, you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extractive. It has never been trans fixed. This long screw would have trans-fixed it and drawn it up with a single pull. When you catch this fellow, you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his possession. Excellent, said Hopkins. But these glasses do puzzle me, I confess. Lady Brackenstall actually saw the three men drinking, did she not? Yes, she was clear about that. Then there is an end of it. What more is to be said? And yet you must admit that the three glasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. What? You see nothing remarkable? Well, well, let it pass. Perhaps when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own, it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simple one is at hand. Of course, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. Well, good morning Hopkins, I don't see that I can be of any use to you, and you appear to have your case very clear. You will let me know when Randall is arrested and any further developments which may occur. I trusted I show soon how to congratulate you of one of successful conclusions. Come Watson, I fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home. During our return journey, I could see by Holmes' face that he was much puzzled by something which he'd observed. Every now and then, by an effort, he would throw off the impression and talk as if the matter were clear. But then his doubts would settle down upon him again, and his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had gone back once more to the great dining room of the Avie Grange in which this midnight tragedy had been enacted. At last by a sudden impulse, just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station, he's sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him. It's gives me my dear fellow, said he as we watch the rear carriages of our train disappearing round a curve. I am sorry to make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life Watson, I simply can't leave that case in this condition. Every instinct that I possess cries out against it. It's wrong, it's all wrong, I swear that it's wrong. And yet the latest story was complete, the major corroboration was sufficient, the detail was fairly exact. What have I to foot up against that? Three wine glasses? That is all. But if I had not taken things for granted, if I'd examined everything with a care which I should have shown, had we approached the case denover and had no cut and dried story to walk my mind, should I not then have found something more definite to go upon? Of course I should. Sit down on this bench Watson until a train for chiselhouse arise and allow me to lay the evidence before you, imploring you in the first instance, to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which to made or her mistress may have said must necessarily be true. The latest charming personality must not be permitted to walk our judgement. Surely there are details in her story which if we looked at it in cold blood, would excite our suspicion. These purgors made a considerable hall at sitting on the fortnight ago, some account of them and of their appearance was in the papers. And would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part? As a matter of fact, burglists who have done a good stroke of business are, as the rule, only two blinds will enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking. Again, it is unusual for burglists to operate at so early an hour. It is unusual for burglists to strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream. It is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man. It is unusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there was much more within their reach. And finally, I should say that it was very unusual for such men to leave a bottle of empty. How do all these unusual strike you Watson? Their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of them is quite possible in itself. The most unusual thing of all, as it seems to me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair. Well, I am not so clear about that Watson, for it is evident they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she could not give immediate notice of their escape. But at any rate, I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story, and now on top of this comes the incident of the wine glasses. What about the wine glasses? Can you see them in your mind's eye? I see them clearly. We are told that three men drank from them. Does that strike you as likely? Why not? There was wine in each glass. Exactly, but there was beeswing only in one glass. He must have noticed that fact, what does that suggest to your mind? The last glass field would be the most likely to contain beeswing. Not at all, the bottles full of it, and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it. There are two possible explanations and only two. One is that after the second glass was filled, the bottle was violently annotated and so the third glass received the beeswing. That does not appear probable. No, no, I am sure that I am right. What then do you suppose? There are only two glasses we use and that the drags of both were poured into a third glass, so as to give the false impression that three people had been here. Is that way all the beeswing would be in the last glass? Would it not? Yes, I convinced that this is so, but if I have hit upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon, then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable for it could only mean that Lady Brakonstall and her maid had deliberately lied to us, that not one word of their stories to be believed, that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal, and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them. That is the mission which now lies before us, and here Watson is the synonym train. The household of the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return, but Sherlock Holmes, finding that Stanley Hawkins had gone off to report to headquarters, took possession of the dining room, locked the door off on the inside, and devoted himself for two hours to one of those my new and laborous investigations which form the solid basis on which his brilliant edifices of deduction were reared. Seated in a corner like an interested student who have observed the demonstration of his professor, I followed every step of that remarkable research. The window, the curtains, the carpet, the chair, the rope, each in turn was mine, neatly examined and july pondered. The body of the unfortunate barrenet have been removed, and all else remained as we had seen it in the warning. Finally, to my astonishment, Holmes climbed up onto the massive mantelpiece. Thara above his head hung the few inches of red cord which was still attached to the wire. For a long time he gazed up for that it, and then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the wall. This brought his hand within a few inches of the broken end of the rope, but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which seemed to engage his attention. Finally, he sprang down with an ejaculation of satisfaction. It's all right Watson, said he. We have got our case, one of the most remarkable in our collection, but dear me, how slow which I have been, and how nearly I have committed the blunder of my life time. Now I think that with a few missing links my chain is almost complete. You have got your men, man Watson, man, only one, but a very formidable person, strong as a lion, witnessed a blow that bent that poker. Six foot three in height, active as a squirrel, dexterous with his fingers, finally remarkably quick witted for this whole ingenious story is of his concoction. Yes Watson, we had come upon the handy work of a very remarkable individual, and yet in that bell wrote, he has given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt. Where was the clue? Well, if you were to pull down a bell wrote Watson, where would you expect it to break? Surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire? Why should it break three inches from the top as this one has done? Because it is afraid there, exactly, this end which we can examine is afraid. He was cunning enough to do that with his knife. But the other end is not afraid. You could not observe that from here, but if you were on the mantelpiece, you would see his cut clean off without any mark of frame, whatever. You can reconstruct what occurred. The man needed the rope. He would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell. What did he do? He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put his knee on the bracket, you will see the impression in the dust, and so got his knife to bear upon the cord. I could not reach the place by at least three inches, from which I infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than I. Look at that mark upon the seat of the open chair. What is it? Blood. Undoubtedly it is blood. This alone puts the lady's story out of court. If she was seated on the chair when the crime was done, how come that mark? No, no, she was placed in the chair after the death of her husband. I'll wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to this. We have not yet met our waterloo Watson, but this is our merronger. For it begins in defeat and ends in victory. I should like now to have a few words with the nurse, Theresa. We must be wary for a while if we are to get the information which we want. She was an interesting person, this stern Australian nurse, Tassi turns suspicious, ungracious. It took some time before Holmes's pleasant manner, and Frank acceptance of all that she said, thought her into a corresponding a myability. She did not attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer. Yes, sir, it is true that he threw the decantrap me. I heard in call my mistress a name, and I told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there. Then it was that he threw it at me. He might have thrown a dozen if he had let my bunny bird alone. He was forever ill-treating her, and she too proud to complain. She were not even told me all that he has done to her. She never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning, but I know very well that they came from a stab would I happen. Thus lie devil, God forgive me that I should speak of him now, so, now that he is dead. But a devil he was, if ever one walked the earth, he was all honey when first we met him. Only 18 months ago, and we both feel as if it were 18 years. She had only just arrived in London, yes it was her first voyage. She had never been from home before. He won her with his title and his money and his false London ways. If she made a mistake, she has paid for it. If ever a woman did. What month did we meet him? Well, I tell you it was just after we arrived. We arrived in June, and it was July. They were married in January of last year. Yes, she is down in the morning room again, and I have no doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too much of her, for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand. Lady Brakingstall was reclining on the same couch, but looked brighter than before. The maid had entered with us and began once more to ferment the bruise upon her mistresses brown. I hope said the lady that who have not come to cross examine me again. No homes answered in his gentlest voice. I would not cause you any unnecessary travel, Lady Brakingstall, and my whole desire is to make things easy for you. For unconvinnst that you are a much-tried woman. If you treat me as a friend and trust me, you may find that I will justify your trust. What do you want me to do? To tell me the truth, Mr. Holmes. No, no Lady Brakingstall. It is no use. You may have heard of any little reputation which I possess. I will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute fabrication. Mr. and maid were both staring at Holmes with pale faces and frightened eyes. You are an impudent fellow, Criter Reason. Do you mean to say that my mistress has told a lie? Holmes rose from his chair. Have you nothing to tell me? I told you everything. Think once more Lady Brakingstall would it not be better to be frank? For an instant there was a hesitation in her beautiful face. Then some new strong thought caused it to set like a mask. I have told you all I know. Holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders. I and sorry he said, and without another word we left the room and the house. Bills upon in the park and to this my friend led the way. It was frozen over but a single hole was left for the convenience of a solitary swan. Holmes gazed at it and then passed on to the lodge gate. There he scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins and left it with the lodge keeper. It may be a hit or it may be a miss but we are bound to do something for friend Hopkins just to justify this second visit said he. I will not quite take him into my confidence yet. I think our next scene of operations must be the shipping offers of the Adelaide Southampton Line which stands at the end of Palmel if I remember right. There is a second line of steamers which connects South Australia with England but we would draw the larger cover first. Holmes's cards sent in to the manager in short instant attention and he was not long in acquiring all the information he needed. In June of 1995 only one of their line had reached a home port. It was the rock of Gibraltar their largest and best boat. A reference to the fashion Julius showed that Miss Fraser of Adelaide with her maid had made the voyage in her. The boat was now somewhere south of the Suez Canal onto a way to Australia. Her officers were the same as in 1995 with one exception. The first officer Mr Jack Crocker had been made a captain and was to take charge of their new ship, the base rock, sailing in two days time from Southampton. He lived in Sydney but it was likely to be in that morning for instructions if we cared to wait for him. No Mr Holmes had no desire to see him but he would be glad to know more about his record and character. His record was magnificent. There was not an officer in the fleet to touch him. As to his character he was reliable on duty but a wild desperate fellow off the deck of his ship hot headed excitable but loyal honest and kind-hearted. That was the piece of information with which Holmes left the office of the Adelaide Southampton company. Then he drove to Scotland yard but instead of entering he sat in his car with his brows drawn down, lost in profound thought. Finally he drove round to the cherry-cross telegraph office, sent off a message and then at last we made for Baker Street once more. No I couldn't do it Watson said he as we re-entered our room. Once that wallant was made out, nothing on earth would save him. Once a twice in my career I feel that I have done more real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime. I have learned caution now and I had rather played tricks with the law of England than with my own conscience. Let us know a little more before we act. Before evening we had a visit from Inspector Stanley Hopkins. Things were not going very well with him. I believe that you are a wizard Mr Holmes. I really do sometimes think that you have powers that are not human. Now how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond? I didn't know it. But you told me to examine it. You got it then? Yes I got it. I am very glad if I have helped you. But you haven't helped me. You have made you a fair far more difficult. What sort of burglars are they who still silver and then throw it into the nearest pond? It was certainly rather eccentric behavior. I was merely going on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not want it, who merely took it for a blind as it were, then they would naturally be anxious to get rid of it. But why should such an idea cross your mind? Well I thought it was possible when they came out through the French window, there was a pond with one tempting little hole in the ice, right in front of their noses. Could there be a better hiding place? Oh a hiding place, that is better, Christ Stanley Hopkins. Yes yes I see it all now. It was early. They were focused on the roads. They were afraid of being seen with the silver. So they sank it in the pond, intended to return for it when the coast was clear. Excellent Mr. Holmes, that is better than your idea of a blind. Quite so. You have got an admirable theory. I have no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild, but you must admit that they have ended in discovering the silver. Yes so yes, it was all you are doing. But I have had a bad setback. A setback? Yes Mr. Holmes, the Randall gang were arrested in New York this morning. Dear me Hopkins, that is certainly rather against your theory that they committed a murder in Kent last night. It is fatal Mr. Holmes. Absolutely fatal. Still there are other groups of three besides the Randall's or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard. Quite so. It is perfectly possible. What are you off? Yes Mr. Holmes, there is no rest for me until I have got to the bottom of this business. I suppose you have no hint to give me. I have given you one. Which? Well, I suggested a blind. But why, Mr. Holmes, why? Ah, that's the question of course. But I commend the idea to your mind. You might possibly find that there was something in it. You won't stop for dinner? Well, goodbye and let us know how you get on. Dinner was over and the table cleared before Holmes alluded to the matter again. He had lit his pipe and held his slippered feet to the cheerful blaze of the fire. Suddenly he looked at his watch. I expect developments Watson. When? Now within a few minutes, I dare say you thought I acted rather badly to stand the Hopkins just now. I trust your judgment. A very sensible reply Watson. You must look at it this way. What I know is unofficial. What he knows is official. I have the right to private judgment. But he has none. He must disclose all, or he is a traitor to his service. In a doubtful case, I would not put him in so painful a position. And so I reserved my information until my mind is clear upon the matter. But when will that be? The time has come. You will now be present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama. There was a sound upon the stairs and our door was open to admit as find a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it. He was a very tall young man, golden moustache, blue-eyed, with a skin which had been burned by tropical suns and a springy step which showed that the huge frame was as active as it was strong. He closed the door behind him and then stood with clenched fists and heaving breast, choking down some over-mastering emotion. Sit down, Captain Crocker, you got my telegram. Now, if you're just a sankin to an armchair and look from one to the other of us with questioning eyes, I got your telegram and I came at the arrow you said. I heard that you had been down to the office. There was no getting away from you. Let's hear the word. What are you going to do with me? Arrest me? Speak out, man. You can't sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse. Give him a cigar, sit homes. By it on that, Captain Crocker, and don't let your nerves run away with you. I should not sit here smoking with you if I thought that you were a common criminal. You may be sure of that. Be frank with me and we may do some good. Play tricks with me and I'll crush you. What do you wish me to do? To give me a full count of all that happened at the epic range last night, a true account, mind you, with nothing added or nothing taken off. I know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight, I'll blow this police whistle from my window, and your fair goes out of my hands forever. The sailor thought for a little, then he struck his leg with his great sombernd hand. Oh, chance it, he cry. I believe you're a man of your word, and a white man, and I'll tell you the whole story. But one thing I will say first, so far as I am concerned, I regret nothing and I fear nothing, and I would do it all again and be proud of the job. Damn the beast, if he had as many lives as a cat, he would owe them all to me. But it's the lady Mary, Mary Fraser, for never will I call her by that accursive name. When I think of getting her into trouble, I who will give my life just to bring one smile to her dear face. It's that that turns my soul into water, and yet and yet, what let's could I do? I'll tell you my story, gentlemen, and then I'll ask you, as a man to man, what less could I do? I must go back a bit, you seem to know everything, so I expect that you know that I met her when she was a passenger, and I was the first officer of the Rock of Gibraltar. From the first day I met her, she was the only woman to me. Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since, have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch, and kissed the deck of that ship, because I knew her dear-feet had fraught it. She was never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. I had no complaint to make. It was all leveled my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man. Next time I came back from sea, I heard of her marriage. Well, why couldn't she marry whom she liked? Tidal and money, who could carry them better than she? She was born for all that is beautiful and dainty. I didn't grieve over her marriage. I was not such a selfish hound as that. I just rejoiced that good luck I'd come her way, and that she had not thrown herself away on a pen and a sailor. That's how I loved Mary Fraser. Well, I never thought to see her again, but last words I was promoted, and the new boat was not yet launched, so I had to wait for a couple of months with my people at Siddenham. One day out in the country Lain I met Tulli's right her old maid. She told me all about her, about him, about everything. I tell you gentlemen, it nearly drove me mad. This drunken hound that he should dare to raise his hand to her, whose boots he was not worthy to lick. I met Tulli's again, then I met Mary herself, and met her again. Then she would meet me no more, but the other day I had a notice that I was to start on my voyage within a week, and I determined that I would see her once before I left. Tulli's was always my friend, for she loved Mary and hated this villain almost as much as I did. From her I learned the ways of the house. Mary used to sit up reading in her own little room downstairs. I crept round their last night, and scratched at the window. At first she would not open to me, but in her heart I know that now she loves me, and she could not leave me in the frosty night. She whispered to me to come round to the big front window, and I found it open before me, so to let me into the dining room. Again I heard from her own lips, things that made my blood bore, and again I cursed this brute whom this handle the woman I loved. By gentleman I was standing with a just inside the window, in all innocence, as God is my judge, when he rushed like a madman into the room, called her the violin's name that a man could use to a woman, and wilted her across the face with a sticky head in his hand. I'd sprung for the poker, and it was a fair fight between us. See here on my own where his first blow fell. Then it was my turn, and I went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin. Do you think I was sorry? Not I. It was his life all mine, but far more than that. It was his life all hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman? That was how I killed him. Was I wrong? Well, then what would either of you gentlemen have done if you had been in my position? She had screened when he struck her, and that brought old to raise a down from the room above. There was a bottle of wine on the skyboard, and I opened it and poured a little between Mary's lips. Who was he was half dead with shock? Then I took a drop myself. To raise it was as cool as ice, and it was her plot as much as mine. We must make it appear that Burgers had done the thing. To raise a kept on repeating our story to her mistress, while ice warmed up and cut the rope of the bell. Then I lashed her in her chair and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural. Else he would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it. Then I gathered up a few plates and pots of silver to carry out the idea of the robbery, and there I left them with orders to give thee a loam when I had a quarter of an hour start. I dropped the silver into the pond and made off for Siddenham. Filling that for once in my life, I had done a real good night's work, and that's the truth and the whole truth, Mr. Holmes, if it cost me my neck. Holmes spoke for some time in silence, then he crossed the room and shook our visitor by the hand. That's what I think said he. I know that every word is true for you have hardly said a word which I did not know. No one but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bell-roke from the bracket, and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened to the chair. Only once had this lady been brought into contact with sailors, and that was on her voyage, and it was someone of her own class of life since he was trying hard to shield him, and so showing that she loved him. You see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once I had started upon the right trail. I thought the police could never have seen through our dodge, and the fleas haven't nor will they to the best of my belief. Now look here Captain Crocker, this is a very serious matter, so I am willing to admit that you acted under the most extreme provocation to which any man could be subjected. I not sure that in defense of your own life, your action will not be pronounced legitimate. However, that is for a British jury to decide. Meanwhile, I have so much sympathy for you that if you choose to disappear in the next 24 hours, I will promise you that no one will hinder you. And then it will all come out, certainly it will come out. The sailor flushed with anger. What sort of proposal is that to make a man? I know enough of law to understand that Mary would be held as a complice. Do you think I would ever leave her alone to face the music while I slung away? No, sir, let them do their words to poem me, but for heaven's sake, Mr. Holmes, finds some way of keeping my poor Mary out of the courts. Holmes for a second time held at his hand to the sailor. I was only testing you, and you ring through every time. It is a great responsibility that I take upon myself, but I have given Hopkins an excellent hint, and if he can't have made himself of it, I can do no more. See here, Captain Crocker, we will do this in due form of law. You are the prisoner, Watson, you are a British jury, and I never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one. Do you find a prisoner guilty or not guilty? Not guilty, my Lord, said I. Vox poppually, Vox Day, you are a quitting Captain Crocker, so long as the law does not find some other victim, you are safe from me. Come back to this lady in a year, and may her future and yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this night. End of the adventure of the Abbey Grange by Arthur Conan Doyle.

For more information or to volunteer, please visit libravox.org, recording by William Jones. Brand the iconoclast, volume one, publishers note. In putting into permanent form, the complete works of William Coward Brand, 21 years after his death, the sole purpose of the present publishers is to preserve, in its entirety, the genius of a writer who's work, though produced under the stress of journalism, is destined to endure as literature. Upon the issues discussed by Brand, the publishers take no sides. They do not stand as sponsors for, nor do they decide to appear in the light of either approving or disapproving his opinions or methods. They were friends and neighbors of many years standing of the men and institutions mentioned in Brand's writings, but were in no way involved in the bitter controversies and the poor pull events, which led to Brand's untimely and dramatic death. The plan and arrangement of this 12-volume set of Brand is simple. The first volume is composed of articles of various links, gathered from Missillanius sources, and includes some of the better known articles from the iconoclast. Vimes 2 to 11 inclusive are the files of the iconoclast from February 1895 to May 1898 inclusive. With the matter arranged approximately as it appeared in the original publication. Volume 12 contains a history of Brand's death and various biographical and critical articles from the press of the day, together with those of Brand's speeches and lectures which have been preserved. At the close of Volume 12, you will find a complete index of subjects and of titled articles for the entire 12 volumes. In the publisher's note, Preface by Milo Hastings. As I read the proofs of the last of these volumes, wherein is told the story of Brand's death, my cup of joy of Loz Labor is embedded with the goal of an impotent, feudal rage against the sore that flings with mocking hand, the seed of genius, and reckons not where it falls. The germ of such a life as Brands, we can't but accept in worship of unquestionated gratitude for the process of its body is too entangled to unravel. But of the environment of his life, we cannot refrain from rebellious questioning, appreciative though we be out that which was, and of our heritage of the inquitable spirit that is and shall be, as long as our language shall last. Genius he is, this only brand we have, genius audacious, defiant and sublime, who stature, though his feet beyond the flat of the brazos' bottom, towers effolgent over those effigies placed on pedestals by orthodox popularity and sickly lighted by professional praise. Nor is my anger born of the fact that Brands, as a warped by his environment of time and place, wasted thought on free silver economics, spent passion on prohibition and negro criminals, lavished wrath on provincial preachers and local politicians, or, how await his style by the so-called vulgarities which alone could shock into attention, the muddleheaded who paid his printer's bill for the privilege of seeing barnyard phrases, and don't ill words in type. All this I can conceive may have been the particular combination of circumstances that were needed to bring to flower a germ of genius that had it been planted in last centuries Boston, might have given us but another hard-working classic, or inviron in this centuries-grinnish village, only another free versifier of souls, a joint amid psychoanalytics and parlor bullshawism. The slouch had a gun-toting beard-ringing woman worshiping man-bating brand of Texas, may have been the particular and only brand we have developed the colossal courage, and fighting fielusness that gave his poor soul the reach and stature, the strength and vigor to raise himself above the mere music of his words. Brandt, as he was when he heard the shot that killed him, I can accept and proclaim as being beyond the need and reach of apology or regret. But what of the brand that would have written on throughout the 21 years that have since he lapsed and that we would have with us still at the prime age of 64? Had brand lived, we would have had the product of eight times the period of his writing life that was, and an added quality born of riper experience, warm momentous themes, more leisure for deliberate composition. We should have heard the man who against petty politicians and occasional pugilists out-sundered Carlisle turned his roaring guns against the blood guilty heads that bade wholesale rape and gaunt hunger stalk rampant in a gory world. It is as if Hugo had written, hungs of Iceland and no Lemisarab, as if Napoleon, the lieutenant of artillery, had but stopped the mobs in the streets of Paris and also let them water-lue had never been. The world has not always profited by its murdery dums. Samson, old and blind, toppled down the temple, and the Philistines that he slew at his death were more than they, which he slew in his life. Not so brand, his death was as tragic and pitiful as the charge of the light brigade, the sacrifice of men at the second road of O'ayne, waste, futile and planless, mere howling, empty, chaotic waste for no purpose under heaven but to serve as food for idle fancies as to what might have been. Such to me is the death of brand, and my throat chokes with sorrow, and my soul is sick with vain despair. Brands contribution to literature is the product of less than three years of writing time. There were previous years of yearning and dreaming, the frenemy of the yoke of galling servitude to newspaper editors on worthy to lose the latches of brands' shoes, his own paper, the iconoclast, in which he first found freedom for utterance, and from which 98% of this present edition is derived, ran for just 40 months, and for six or eight months of this period, brand was on lecture tours, during which time his paper was largely filled with outside contributions. That a magazine could succeed at all in Waco is one of the seven wonders of the literary world, that a magazine so located and written by one man haven't got a poultry advertising patronage, no illustrations, no covers, could in three years' time rival the circulation of any magazine then published is as much a miracle as the parting of the red sea waters, or the bountiful persistence of the widdles oil. It is on this three years' work that brands' fame must rest. Barring a few poets, the literary colossi have seldom had less than the work of a score of years on which to base their claims for greatness. Gerta, Hugo Tolstoy, Mark Twain, each wrote for more than 50 years, but greater range of variety and distance, as well as span of time contributed to their product. They travel up and down the world of men, mingle with many races, sail seas, climbed mountains, lived in Metropoles, and dined with princes. Brands, most notable personal acquaintances, were country-town editors, and provincial politicians, very like the ilk of a hundred other states and provinces in the raw corners of the world. He lived and died in that stale, flat and literary, unprofitable expanse of prairie, between Lake Michigan and the Rio Grande, where man's most pretentious achievement was the Eeds bridge at St. Louis. Nature's most spectacular effort, the Ozark Mountains, and literature's most worthy resident, representative William Marion Reading. So, in viran, in a time when the bicycle marked the acne of progress and Brian could be a hero, in a flat-broofed Texas town whose intellectual glory was a Baptist college, and whose answer to arguments, ropes and revolvers, brand-roat for only three years, and wrote as Shakespeare wrote, unmindful alike of critics, binders, and bookworms. Only by the thoughtful faith that men are made by their adversity, can we reconcile our charge against the soar, who cast the seed of genius to fall on such barren ground? I made the stones of a sterile time and a briars of bullet-answering bigotry. But vain are the might of bins, and fortunate are we to have, as we have, the stuff out of which far-reemed fame resounds unto generations, when teeth are no longer set on edge. When men will have forgotten the taboos of a little day, and the dust of our misgrendies will be reeds to choke the freedom of grass. The copies of the iconoclast, bread in their day till worn to terrors, were ill adapted to preservation. It were futile to look for them in libraries. For bread was about as welcome in those formal repositories of the proper in literature, as matches in a powderville. So far as they are aware, the file of the iconoclast possessed by the present publishers, and from which this addition is reproduced, is the only complete file in existence. For 20 years, this priceless literary heritage has been waiting, precariously subjected to the facetitudes of earthly circumstance, like a lone great manuscript within the cloister of a medieval monk, Brand's work might have perished utterly soon after his creation, like a song of magic music held but flitantly within the heart that heard it. But the blood of ink now flows again through the multiplying presses, and the flaming phrases of the iconoclast, shot like chefs of gold from over the mountains of El Dorado by the sun of genius still alive and will endure. Again, the million words leap from the yellow pages like tons of fire and beauty, and 10,000 voices were cry and sing again before the hearth of those who once knew and loved the wake of iconoclast, who will sing and cry in the homes of their children and their children who will read and acclaim, Brand as a God, whose name is written forever in the stars. These facts are here set down that they who read in days to come, may marvel as I do now, that two-score issues, a brave provincial paper, consistently contains such a freight of imperishable literature, revealing a learning positively prodigious, a style that flows with a sonorous majesty and crashes with a vitriolic and destroying power, a lavish richness in a figurative language, a beauty of a ole in the harps of sapphire seas of the flesh and ardent splendor of poetic nights. What's came the towering intellect, the wealth of knowledge, the mastery of words, the music of style, the diapason of feeling, it could only come from the sources that are available to any American who can read. The most formal aid that could have contributed is the free shelves of the St. Louis Public Library. The miracle of Brand's growth and flowering is more marvelous than that of pole, less explainable than that of Shakespeare, that Brand knew the literary classics of the world is obvious from his every line, but unless we invent some theory of universal telepathy to have whafed inspiration to Waco from all the canonized dead from Homer to Carlisle, we can only conceive that Brand derived his knowledge and his power without encouragement and without guidance by pouring over the printed page in lonely hours, and literally rested from the wolf of poverty that for 40 years, held mortgage on his time. What he possessed, however God, was a combination of all those recognized elements of literary greatness, except one thing. He hated not the warning of cultured mediocrity that commands most writers what do leave unsaid. Brand left nothing unsaid, and because of that fact was locked out of colleges, libraries, in cycle of pedias and halls of fame. Where other writers waste half their energies in deciding what may be written, Brand gave his full energy to writing what he thought. There's an all-things else he matched and equal others, in this one fact of absolute audacity and complete freedom from fear, he outmatched all, and so close the penance mouth of praise. And so cruel, terrible and sublime, Brand opened the ears of the people by the mighty power of his untamed language by the smashing fury of his wrath of words. A point of disadvantage of the little country town lost in the immensity of the Texas Prairie, Brand saw the world, and saw it with the blazing eye of righteous wrath. He saw the sins of high society in New York and London, the rottenness of autocracy in Russia, the world war boiling beneath the surface in the cauldron of Europe's misery. He saw also with mingle humor and anger that trivial passing events of his own state and nation, and the local affairs of his hometown. Of all these things, great and small, he wrote with equal fervor, equal venom and equal power. Today the war is fought, the Zarr is dead, free silver is forgotten, and the local enumosities that Brand brewed in his own state, live only in the memories of a few old men. With the rule of the years the perspective of time, like a low swung sun cast the mountain shadow ever further across the valley. And Brand, the waco journalist has become Brand the American genius, no matter how dead the issues, how local to time in place, the characters of which he wrote, his writing is literature and the imperishable legacy of the world. The biblical story of Joseph would be equally great if his name had been Vuchau and Pharaoh had been the Emperor Wu Wang Wang. He would be immortal if his name were El Percy Smith and his uncle was a pork packer at Omaha. The prodigal son has no name, this swine he fed new no country, particular names, local places and passing forms and institutions are not the essence of literature. For those who formerly read Brand in the iconoclast he was a Texas journalist in the free silver days. For those who shall read his work in these days after the World War, New York might as well be Babylon, Marquana, Hammond and the files of the iconoclast, Clay tablets, Doug from the ruins of some long buried waco of the U. Fratee's Valley. It is only the transcendent genius who can afford to be careless of the preservation of his product. Socrates merely talked to Chats and Cyples in the grows of Athens, other men wrote and preserved his words. Shakespeare wrote plays for his current theatrical business. Others gathered and printed his manuscripts. While he lived, Brand's writings never saw the diggy of a cloth-bound book. They were not written for carefully edited thrice proofread leatherbound volumes, but ground out for the unmoist hand of a waco printer's devil, done into hastily set-type and jammed between badly set-bear ads and patent medicine testimonials on a thin little job press sheet that could be rolled up and stuck through a wedding ring. Brand's range of literary form was limited by his single avenue of publication, through the columns of a one-man paper and varied from the tin-word epigrams of Salmagundae to the 10,000-word article or published lecture. Within this range is evidenced at least three distinct types of literary composition. First and foremost, involume and effect, is the phylipic or iconoclastic article, mind-leaning invariant proportions that he sounding musical cadence of ingrassolian oratory, and the punch-on-autacious epigramatic twists on which hovered with clever or salesmanship, built a more profitable, if not more noble fame. It was the destroyer, the iconoclastic that brand best saw himself. To this role, he devoted a great preponderance of his time in talent. But there is another brand, unknown to many who have conceived him only as an idle smasher, in a parcel of the devil, an angry-priced driving out the defylers of the temple with a lash of scorpions tales. Brand the poet, the lover of beauty, speaks even amidst the ruins of the houses of hypocrisy and shame, which he has wrecked. There is scarce a page in all his writings in which sheer beauty does not stand out amid the ugliest of carnage and destruction, in which the strains of celestial music are not heard above the roar of earthly battle. But more than this, there are many articles that are wholly cut from a cloth of gold. Many of the finest of these gems of pure literature were omitted from the early and incomplete book publication of brand, for the compilers who made that hasty and inadequate selection were too close to the bitterness of his death to see this other brand. Too site from the first volume only. Where have you heard a more beautiful sermon from a Christian pulpit than charity or throwing stones at Christ? Can you find in prose or poetry more melody of language than in life and death? In all our countless volumes of fiction have you ever read a more wondrous tale then their comes one after, or a story of the sea? Too read only such as these is to know a very different brand from the author of the Bradley Morton Ball Mask or Garthers and Amen Grounds. The brand who wrote Life and Death by that worth alone, wins to undying fame as surely as does gray by his allergy written in a country churchyard. I have combed my memory in vain to match yet from an American pen. A few paragraphs from Ingrisol, a few pages from Paul, a few stances from Whitman, but make your own search and your own comparisons. And if in your final ranking brand stands not among the titans, who number less than the fingers on God's hand, it will be because you cannot divorce the sublime beauty of life and death from the coyotes and the jackals that run rip it through the pages of brand, the shocker of the thin of skin. Lastly consider brand the teller of stories, for laughter and for tears. Some of these tales are allegories as universal to the life of man as pilgrims progress. Elsewhere, as in the fictional essay on the cow, and in the delightful lies that brand in wrongy mischief attributed to his fellow Texas journalists, we find a humorous tale enriched with a bizarre and scintillating figure. Nor as a brand unconscious of his fictional gift, for he was working on a novel at the time of his death. That ohinri's ambition to write may be accredited to the influence of brand seems more than probable. Brands first attempt to stroke the iconoclast was made at Austin, Texas, but this first paper survived only a few issues. Ohinri then adrugged clerk in Austin, being filled with literary aspiration, bought the press and the name of the iconoclast for $250. But ohinri's iconoclast after two issues also ceased to flutter. Later when brand again accumulated the necessary funds to permit him to throw off the higherly in the oak, he asked for and received back from Ohinri, the legal right to the title of his own newspaper. I'm really interested in it not to cast discredit upon Ohinri's originality. His unique mastery of story structure was all his own, but that richness of figurative speech, particularly those exaggerated humorous metaphors, which makes his every paragraph so delightful, we may well believe to be an Elijah's mantle fallen from the shoulders of brand and weren't over a new Tudig. Should any man create more than a rare few of the words he uses, his speech would be as meaningless as a doctor of theology explaining the Trinity. Likewise, that subtle thing called style that we've been fined of the dead ashes of dictionary words, though more peculiar to the man is most potent when a girl is freely but wisely from all that has gone before. Stevenson Red and confessed to deliberate practice work and imitation of the masters that preceded him. So we know that brand Red absorbed transmuted and transfigured the style of the classic writers and added a daring measure of reckless originality. As brand Red is Homer and his Carlisle, his Shakespeare and his Ingersal, so Hubbard and Ohinri read their brand, and Hubbard specifically commends him to the would be writer as Johnson recommended attison. There is no or that will essay more literary metal to the page than brand. As a writer's writer, no man of our time surpasses him. His vocabulary is conceded even by his most invious critics to outrage that of any other American. His gift of figurative speech that is central that distinguishes literature from mere correct writing, rifles that of any writer in any country language or time. Brands' compass of words, idioms and phrases, hearts back to the arcade and reaches forward to the futuristic. If you wish merely to learn to appreciate literature so that you may not approve of an polite society when an accredited writers name is mentioned, go to college and listen to the lectures of literary PhDs. But if you want to learn to write, take your Bible, your Shakespeare and your brand and hire you to your Garrett that you read, re-re-study, memorize, and imitate if you can. And God be praised if you steal the best and to it add somewhat of your own. Brand Ophins' shocks in outrageous is suppressed damned, frorcibly ignored and laboriously forgotten, because though the large sings in his words, the buzzer is on the wing. But Brand did not make this tinge that Ophins the nostrils of the nice. He only stirred up the cesspools to let us know that they were there and so enlist volunteers for their abatement. That riles the kept keepers of lesser fumes, because they have agreed that the fine art of letters should be to spray the ethyro roses to counteract the noise and smells of that which is rotten in the state of the world. Where the many reek and sweat in filth and poverty that the few may live in perfume palaces. Many many tackle Ophiris and, shot in brand, and died shouting, while the well-fed and fatted set on the lid to keep it down. But we who have lived to see the lid blown off Russia and feel the growl and grumble of the bowels of all the earth, need not overstrain our ears to hear brand laughing now in that good Baptist hell to which a bullet in the back gave him the passport.

Arsène Lupin,Maurice Leblanc,111059,13.0,"October 5, 2019",[],0,"sen Lupa by Mojis Liblo translated by Edgar Jebson. Chapter 1 The Millionaires Daughter The rays of the September sun flooded the great halls of the old chattel of the duks of shahmhass, writing up with their mellow glow, the spoils of so many ages, and many lands, jumbled together with the executable taste, which so often afflits those who's only standard of value is money. The golden light warmed the paneled walls and old furniture to a dual luster, and gave back to the fading guilt of the first empire chairs and couches, something of its old brightness. It illumined the long line of pictures on the walls, pictures of dead and gone shahmhass, the stern or dewanair faces of the men, soldiers, statesmen, dandies, the gentle, were imperious faces of beautiful women. It flashed back from armor of brightly polished steel, and drew dull gleams from armor of bronze. The hues of rare porcelain, of the rich inlays of Oriental or Renaissance cabinets, mingled with the hues of the pictures, the tapestry, the Persian rugs about the polished floor, the fill the hall with a rich glow of color. But of all the beautiful and precious things, which the sun rays warm to a clearer beauty, the face of the girl, hues sat writing at a table in front of the long windows, which opened on to the centuries old turf of the broad terrace, was the most beautiful and the most precious. It was a delicate, almost frail beauty. Her skin was clear with the transparent luster of old porcelain, and her pale cheeks were only tinted with the pink of the faintest roses. Her straight nose was delicately cut, her rounded chin, admirably molded. A lover of beauty would have been at a loss, whether more to admire her clear, dramatic eyes, so melting and so adorable, or the sensitive mouth, with its rather full lips inviting all the kisses. But assuredly, he would have been grieved by the perpetual air of sadness, which rested on the beautiful face. The wistful melancholy of the slough, deepened by something of personal misfortune and suffering. Her face was framed by a mass of soft-fair here, shocked with strands of gold, where the sunlight fell on it. In little curls, rebellious to the calm, straight over her white forehead, tiny feathers of gold. She was addressing envelopes, in a long list of names lay on her left hand. When she had dressed in envelope, she slipped into it a wedding card. On each was printed. Mcegour ne m'hâhtâ has the honor to inform you of the marriage of his daughter, Germain, to the Duke of Shah-hâs. She wrote steadily on, adding envelope after envelope to the pile ready for the post, which rose in front of her. But now and again, when the flushed and laughing girls who were playing long tenies on the terrace, raised their voices hired unusual as they called a score, and distracted her attention from her work, her gaze strayed through the open window, and lingered on them wistfully. And as her eyes came back to her task, she sighed, with so faint to wistfulness that she hardly knew she sighed. Ben, a voice from the terrace cried, Sanya, Sanya! Yes, ma'ad m'hâs'el-jahmein, answered the writing girl. T, order T will you? Cry the voice, a petulant voice, rather harsh to the ear. Very well, and m'h-zel-jahmein, sad Sanya. And having finished addressing the envelope under her pen, she laid it on the pile, ready to be posted, and crossing the room to the old, wide fireplace, she rang the bell. She stood by the fireplace a moment, restoring to its place a rose, which had fallen from a vase on the mental piece. And her attitude, as with arms upraised, she arranged the flowers, the vase, displayed the delightful line of a slender figure. As she let fall her arms to her side, a footman, entered the room. When he pleased being the teal friend, she sat in a charming voice of the pure bell-like tone, which has been nature's most precious gift to but a few of the greatest actresses. For how many miss, said Alfred. For four, unless your master has come back. Oh, no, he's not back yet miss. He went in the car to hand to lunch, and it's a good mini mile away. He won't be back for another hour. And the Duke, he's not back from his right yet, is he? Not yet, miss, said Alfred turning to go. One moment, sad Sanya. Have all of you got your things packed for the journey to Paris? You'll have to start soon, you know. Are all the mates ready? Well, all the men are ready, I know miss, but about the maids' miss I can say. They've been bustling about all day, but it takes them longer than it does us. Tell him to hurry up, and be as quick as it can with the tea, please. Said Sanya. Alfred went out of the room. Sanya went back to the writing table. She did not take up her pen. She took up one of the wedding cards. Her lips moved slowly, as she read it in a pondering the pression. The patialant in periods voiced broken upon her musing. Whatever you do, Sanya, aren't you getting yon with those letters? It cried angrily. And Jermaine Gurnemachta came through long window into the hall. The heirs to the Gurnemachta millions carried her tennis racket in her hand, and her rosy cheeks were flushed rather than ever by the game. She was a pretty girl, and as striking, high-colored, rather obvious way. The very foil to Sanya's delicate beauty. Her lips were a little too thin, her eyes too shallow, and together they gave her a rather hard air and strongest contrast to the gentle, sympathetic face of Sanya. And the two friends with Humbzir Mane had been playing tennis followed her into the hall. Jengutie, tall, shallow, dark, with a somewhat malicious air. Maribouye, short, round, commonplace, and sentimental. They came to the table at which Sanya was at work, and pointing to the pile of envelopes Maris said, are these all wedding cards? Yes, and we've only got to the letter V, Sajir Mane, frowning at Sanya. I'm obsessed with her, not to cast the vulviers, Marquis, Marquines, even invited the whole form of Sajir Mane, said, mahi, shoving the pile of envelopes with an envisair. You'll know very few people at your wedding, said Jhan, with a spiteful little go. Hi, baguette, pardon my dear, Sajir Mane, boastfully. Madame de Jose, my fiancée's cousin, gave in that home the other day in my honor. Edda, she introduced half Paris to me. The Paris I'm destined to know. The Paris you'll see in my drawing rooms. But we shall no longer be fit friends for you when you're the Duchess of Shamanthas, Sajir Jhan. Why, Sajir Mane, and then she added quickly. About everything, Sanya, don't forget to relay to these 33 University Street, 33 University Street. Relicties, 33 University Street, said Sanya, taking a fresh envelope and beginning to address it. Wait, wait, don't call the envelope. I'm wondering whether really Glyz ought to have a cross, a double cross or a chipper cross, such as Mane, with an air of extreme importance. Once that, Padmari and Jhan together. A single cross means an invitation to the church, a double cross, an invitation to the marriage and the wedding breakfast, and a triple cross means an invitation to the marriage, the breakfast, and the signing of the marriage contract. What do you think the Duchess of Illiglies ought to have? Don't ask me, I have in the honor of knowing that great lady, Kray Jhan. All right, Sajir Mane, but I have here the visiting list of the late Duchess of Shambhras, Jhaks' mother. The two Duchesses were on excellent terms. Besides, the Duchess of Illiglies is rather worn out, but greatly admired for her piety. She goes to early service three times a week. Then put three crosses, Sajir Mane, Sajir Mane, said Mane quickly. In your place, my dear, I shouldn't risk a slip. I should ask my fiance's advice. He knows this world. Oh goodness, my fiance. He doesn't care a wrap about this kind of thing. He has changed so in the last seven years. Seven years ago, he took nothing seriously. Ah, he said often an expedition to the South Pole, just to show off. Oh, in those days he was truly a Duke. And today, Sajir Mane. Oh, today he's a regular slow coach. Society gets on his nerves. He's a sober as a judge. Sajir Mane. He says Gay is a large, said Sonia in sudden protest. Jir Mane pouted at her and said, oh, he's gay enough when he's making fun of people. But apart from that, he's a sober as a judge. Your father must be delighted with a change, Sajir Mane. Naturally, he's delighted. All right, he's lunching at her end today with a minister with a so-object of getting a shock decorated. Well, the Legion of Honor is a fine thing to have. Sajir Mane. Hi, dear. The Legion of Honor is all very well for middle class people, but it's quite out of place for a Duke, quite a German. Alfred came in, bearing the tea tray, and sat it on a little table near that at which Sonia was sitting. Jir Mane, who was feeling too important to sit still, was walking up and down the room. Suddenly, she stopped short, and pointing to a silver statue wet, which stood on the piano, she said, what's this? Why is this statue wet here? Hi, when we came in, it was all the cabinet, and it's usual place, said Sonia in some astonishment. Did you come into the hall while we were out in the garden, Alfred? Sajir Mane to the foot, man. No, miss, said Alfred. But someone must have come into it. I've not heard anyone, nor was it my pantry, said Alfred. It's very odd, Sajir Mane. It is odd, Sajir Sonia. Statue ads don't move about of themselves. All of them stared at the statue wet, as if they expected to move again forth with under their very eyes. Then, Alfred put it back in its usual place on one of the cabinets, and went out of the room. Sonia poured out the tea, and over it they babbled about the coming marriage. The frux they would wear at it, and the presence remain had already received. That reminded her to ask Sonia, if anyone had yet telephone from her father's house in Paris, and Sonia said that no one had. Pouting, she shrugged her shoulders with an ear of a spoiled child, which sat but poorly on a well-developed young woman of 23. It's Sunday, the shops don't deliver things on Sunday, said Sonia gently. It just means to pouted like a spoiled child. Isn't your beautiful dude coming to have tea with us? Sajir, a little anxiously? Oh yes, I'm expecting him in half past four. He had to go for a ride with a chudubui. They're coming to tea here too, Sajir Mane. Gone for a ride with a chudubui, but when cried my he quickly? He said, my he, my brother went to the jubui's house after lunch to see Andrei and Georges. They went for a drive this morning and want me back to late tonight. Well, but why did the jukteumi so? Sajir Mane, knitting her brow with a puzzle there? If I were you, I should inquire into this thoroughly. Jukts, well, you know what jukts are. It would be just as well to keep an eye on him. Jukts had John maliciously. Jukts mean flushed quickly in her eyes fleshed. Thank you. I have every confidence in Jukts. I am absolutely sure of him. She said, angrily. Oh well, if you're sure, it's all right. Sajir Mane. The ringing of the telephone bell made a fortunate diversion. Jukts mean rushed to it. Clap the receiver to her ear and cried. Hello? Is that you Pierre? Oh, is it twer? Is it? Uh, some present have come, have they? Well, well, what are they? What? A paper knife? A mother paper knife? Another least, sixteenth instead? Oh, father. Where are they from? Oh, from the Countess Rudolf in the Wandererie? Her voice rules high, thrilling with pride. Then she turned her face to her friends, with the receivers still at her ear. And cried. Oh, girls are pro-neclus too! Oh, hard to win. The pearls are big ones. How jolly, Sajir Mane. Who sent it? Sajir Mane turned to the telephone again. Oh, a friend of Papa's. She added in a tone of disappointment. Never mind, after all it's a pro-neclus. You sure unlock the door carefully, Victor. I'll watch you? And lock up the necklace in the secret cupboard. Yes. Thanks very much, Victor. I shall see you tomorrow. She hung up the receiver, and came away from the telephone, frowning. It's preposterous, she said, paddishly. Papa's friends and relations give me marvelous presence, and all the swells send me paper knives. It's all jack's fault. He's above all this kind of thing. The football sajir Mane hardly knows that they're engaged. He doesn't go about advertising it. Sajir Mane. You're joking, but all the same much as he's true. Sajir Mane. That's exactly what his cousin Madamda Hills, he said to me the other day, at the end of the day at home she gave him my honor. Wasn't it Sonia? And she walked to the window, and turning her back on the seared out of it. She has got her mouth full of that at home. Said Jean-Mahéne Lou-Vois. There was an awkward silence. Mahie broke it. Speaking of Madamdae-Hausie, Do you know that she's on pins and needles within sighty? Her son is fighting a duel today. She said, hmm, said Sonia. No one knows. She got hold of a letter from the sentence, said Mahie. Mind, mind is quite at rest about Rheussier, such a man. He's the first class swordsman, no one could beat him. Sonia did not seem to share her freedom from anxiety. Her forehead was spuckered in little lines of proplexity. As if she were puzzling out some problem. And there was a look of something very like fear in her gentle eyes. Wasn't Helzi F, a great friend of your fiancée at one time? Said Jean. A great friend? I should think he was. Said Jean-Mahéne Lou-Vois. What? He was through Helzi F that we got you no shock. Where was that? Said Mahie. Here, in this very short term. Said Jean-Mahéne Lou-Vois. Actually, in his own house, Said Mahiene's some surprise. Yes, actually here. Isn't life funny? Said Jean-Mahéne. If a few months after his father's death, Jacques had not found himself hard of and obliged to dispose of this château to raise the money for his expedition to the salko. And if a pioneer had not won, then his story is château. And lastly, if a pebble had not suffered from rheumatism, I should not be calling myself in a month from now. The Duchess of Shumha's. Now, while the nerd has your father's rheumatism, go to do with your being Duchess of Shumha's. Pride Jean. Everything, said Jean-Mahéne. Papa was afraid that this château was damp. To prove to Papa that he had nothing to fear. Jacques and consenir offered him his hospitality. Here, at Shumha's for three weeks. That was truly duke, said Mahie. But he's always like that. Said Sonia. Oh, he's all right in that way. Let all his e-cures about society. Said Jean-Mahéne. Well, by a miracle, by father but cured of his rheumatism here. Jacques fell in love with me. Papa made up his mind to buy the château. And I demanded the hand of Jacques in marriage. You did? But you were only 16 then. Said Mahie with some surprise. Yes? But even at 16, a girl ought to know that a duke is a duke. I did, said Jean-Mahéne. Then, since Jacques was setting out for the south pole, and Papa considered me much too young to get married, I promised Jacques to wait for his return. Why? It was everything that's romantic. Pride Mahie. Romantic? Oh, yes. Said Jean-Mahéne, and she pouted. But between ourselves, if I'd known that he was going to stay all the way, I was going to stay all that time at the south pole, that's true, broken Mahie. To go away for three years and stay away seven at the end of the world, all Jean-Mahéne's beautiful youth, said Jean with her malicious smile. Thanks, said Jean-Mahéne, tarkly. Well, you are a 23. It's the far of one's age, said Jean. Not quite 23, said Jean-Mahéne hastly. And look at the wretched luck I've had. The Duke falls ill and is treated at Montevideo. As soon as he recovers, since he's the most absolute person in the world, he resolves to go on with the expedition. He sets out, and for an age without a word of warning, there's no more news of him. No news of any kind. For six months, you know, we believed him dead. Dead? Oh, how unhappy you must have been, said Jean-Mahéne. Oh, don't speak of it. For six months, I didn't put on a light frog. Said Jean-Mahéne turning to her. A lot should be left for him. We should be together. Fortunately, one fine day, the ladders begin again. Three months ago, a telegram, he formed us, that he was coming back. And at last, the Duke returned, with a theatrical ear. The Duke returned, cried Jean, and never mind, fancy waiting nearly seven years for once fiancé. That was constancy, said Sonia. Oh, you're a sentimentalist, Montmazelle Krichnoff, said Jean, in a tone of mockery. It was the influence of the castle. To own the castle of Shomachas, and call oneself madmazelle Gournemachta, it's not worth doing. One must become a Duchess, said Jean. Yes, yes, and for all this wonderful constancy, seven years of it, she had a man was on the point of becoming engaged to another man, said Mahae's smiling. And he, a mere baron, said Jean laughing. What? Is that true? Said Sonia. Didn't you know Mahae was on the kitchen off? She nearly became engaged in a Duchess cousin. The Bahonde Hillsier. It was not nearly so grand. Oh, it's so very well to laugh at me. But being the cousin and heir of the Duke, Hell's yeah, would have assumed a title. And I should have been Dutchess just the same. Said Jean, may I try, and for me. If it didn't, that was all that mattered, said Jean. Well, dear, I must be off. We've promised to run in to see the contested equation. You know the contested equation? She spoke with a near of careless pride and rose to go. Only by name, Papa used to know her husband or the stock exchange, when he was still called simply misyagroja. For his part, Papa preferred to keep his name intact. Said Jean, may I be quiet pride. In tact, that's the one way of looking at it. Well, then, I'll see you in Paris. You still intend to start tomorrow? Said Jean. Yes, tomorrow morning, said Jean, may I be quiet. Jean, may I sleep on their dust coats to the accompaniment of chattering and kissing? And went out of the room. As she calls the door on them, she'll return to Sonya and said, I do hate those two girls. There's such horrible snobbs. Oh, they're good nature enough, said Sonya. Good natured. Oh, hi, you idiot. They're just bursting within the of me, bursting, said Jean, may I be quiet? They have every reason to be, she added confidently, serving herself in a Venetian mirror with a padded child's self-content.

Fancies Versus Fads,G. K. Chesterton,105688,3.0,"March 23, 2019",[],0,"LeBrovox.org. Recording by Larry Wilson. Fancy's Versus Fads by G.K. Chesterton. Introduction. I have strong these things together on a slight enough thread, but as the things themselves are slight, it is possible that the thread and the metaphor may manage to hang together. These notes range over very, very gated topics and in many cases were made at very different times. They concern all sorts of things from LeBrovox barristers to cavemen and from psychoanalysis to freeverse. Yet they have this amount of unity in their wandering, that they all imply that it is only a more traditional spirit that is truly able to wander. The wild theorists of our time are quite unable to wander. When they talk of making new roads, they are only making new routes. Each of them is necessarily imprisoned in his own curious cosmos. In other words, he is limited by the very largeness of his own generalization. The explanations of the Marxian must not go outside economics. And the student of Freud is forbidden to forget sex. To see only the fancival side of these serious sex may seem a very frivolous pleasure, and I will not dispute that these are very frivolous criticisms. I only submit that this frivolity is the last lingering form of freedom. In short, the note of these notes, so to speak, is that it is only from a normal standpoint that all the nonsense of the world takes on something of the wild interest of Wonderland. I mean, it is only in the mirror of a very moderate sense in sanity, which is all I have ever claimed to possess, that even in sanity's can appear as images clear enough to appeal to the imagination. After all, the ordinary Orthodox person is he to whom the heresies can appear as fantasies. After all, it is we ordinary human and humdrum people who can enjoy eccentricity as a sort of elf land. While the eccentrics are too serious, even to know that they are elves. When a man tells us that he disapproves of children being told fairy tales, it is we who can perceive that he is himself a fairy. He himself has not the least idea of it. When he says he would discourage children from playing with tin soldiers, because it is militarism, it is we and not he who can enjoy and fancy the fantastic possibilities of his idea. It is we who suddenly think of children playing with little tin figures of philanthropists, rather round and with tin top hats. The little tin gods of our commercial religion. It is we who develop his imaginative idea for him by suggesting little lead and dolls of conscientious objectives in fixed attitudes of refined repugments. For a whole regiment of tiny Quakers with little gray coats and white flames, he would never have thought of any of these a substitute for himself. His negation is purely negative. Or when an educational philosopher tells us that the child should have complete equality with the adult, he cannot really carry his idea any farther without our assistance. It will be from us and not from him that the natural suggestion will come, that the baby should take its turn and carry the mother, the moment the mother is tired of carrying the baby. He will not win left to himself call up the poetical picture of the child, we lean a double perambulator with the father and mother at each end. He has no motive to look for lively logical developments. For him the assimilation of parent and child is simply a platitude and an inevitable part of his own rather platitudinous philosophy. It is we and not he who can behold the whole vista and vanishing perspective of his own opinions and work out what he really means. It is only those who have ordinary views who have extraordinary visions. There is indeed nothing very extraordinary about these visions except the extraordinary people who have provoked some of them. They are only very sketchy sort of sketches of some of the strange things that may be found in the modern world. But however inadequate be the example, it is nonetheless true that this is the sound principle behind much better examples and that in those great things as in these small ones sanity was the condition of set higher. It is because Gullover is a man of moderate stature that he can stray into the land of the giants and the land of the pigments. It is swift and not the professors of Laputa who sees the real romance of getting some beams out of cucumbers. It would be less than exact to call swift a some beam in the house. But if he did not himself get much sunshine out of cucumbers, at least he let daylight into professors. It was not the mad swift but the saints whipped who made that story so wild. The truth is more self-evident in men who were more sane. It is the good sense of rubble that makes him seem to grin like a gargoyle and it is in a sense because Dickens was a Philistine that he saw the land so full of strange gods. These ideal journalistic jottings have nothing in common with such standards of real literature except the principle involved but the principle is the right one. But while these are frivolous essays pretending only to touch on topics and theories they cannot exhaustively examine, I have added some that may not seem to fit so easily even into so slightest scheme. Nevertheless they are in some sense connected with it. I have opened with an essay on rhyme because it is a type of a sort of tradition which the antitraditionalists now attack and I have ended with one called Milton and Mary England because I feel that many may understand by case against the new Puritans. If they have no notion of how I should attempt to meet the more accepted case in favor of the old Puritans. Both these articles appear to originally in the London Mercury and I desire to express my thanks to Mr. J. C. S. Square for his kind permission to reprint them. But in the latter case I had the further feeling that I wish to express somewhere the historical sentiment that underlies the whole. The conviction that they're did and does exist a more normal and national England which we once inhabited and to which we may yet return and which is not a utopia but a whole. I have therefore thought it worthwhile to write this line of introduction to show that such a scrapbook is not entirely scrappy and that even to touch such things lightly we need something like a test. It is necessary to have in hand a truth to judge modern philosophies rapidly and it is necessary to judge them very rapidly to judge them before they disappear.

To the north rises the old crater, black at night, against the unfathomable blue of the sky. From the little circular building, with its mushroomed arm, the slopes plunged steeply downward into the black mysteries of the tropical forest beneath. The little house in which the observatory and his assistant live is, the about 50 yards from the observatory and beyond this are the huts of their native attendance. The study the chief observer was down with a slight fever. His assistant would house, paused for a moment in silent contemplation of the tropical night before commencing his solitary vigil. The night was very still. Now and then voices and laughter came from the native huts. Or the cry of some strange animal was heard from the midst of the mystery of the forest. Not turnling, sex appeared in ghostly fashion, out of the darkness and fluttered round his light. He thought perhaps, of all the possibilities of discovery that still lay in the black tank of beneath him. For to the naturalist, the virgin forest of Borneo, a still a wonderland full of strange questions and half suspected discoveries. Woodhouse carried a small lantern in his hand, and its yellow glow contrasted vividly with the infinite series of tints between lavender blue and black in which the landscape was painted. His hands and face were smeared with ointment against the attacks of the mosquitos. Even in these days of celestial photography, worked on in a purely temporary erection, and with only the most primitive appliances in addition to the telescope still involves a very large amount of cramped and motionless watching. He sighed as he thought of the physical fatigue before him, stretched himself, and entered the observatory. The read reads properly familiar with the structure of an ordinary astronomical observatory. The building is usually cylindrical in shape, with a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from the interior. The telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the centre, and the clockwork arrangement compensates with the earth's rotation. The lousest star once found to be continuously observed. Besides this, there is a compact trace of real wheels and screws about its point of support, by which the astronomer adjusts it. There is, of course, a slit in the movable roof which follows the eye of the telescope in its survey of the heavens. The observer sits all eyes on a sloping wooden arrangement, which he can wheel to any part of the observatory as a position of the telescope may require. Within, it is advisable to have things as dark as possible, in order to enhance the brilliance of the stars observed. The lousest and thread, as wood house entered his circular den, and the general darkness fled into black shadows behind the big machine, from which he had presently seen to creep back over the whole place again as a light waned. The slit was a profound transparent blue, in which six stars shone with tropical brilliance, and then lightly a pallid gleam along the black tube of the instrument, would have shifted the roof and then proceeding to the telescope, turned the first one wheel and then another. The great cylinder slowly swinging into a new position. Then he glance through the finder, the little companion telescope, moved the roof a little more, made some further adjustments, and set the clockwork in motion. He took off his jacket for the night was very hot, and pushed into position the uncomfortable seat to which he was condemned for the next four hours. Then, with the sigh, he resigned himself to his watch upon the mysteries of space. There was no sound now in the observatory, in the lantern-wane steadily. Outside there was the occasional cry of some animal in alarm or pain, or calling to his mate, and the intermittent sounds of the malay in the deacrestervence. Suddenly one of the men began a queer chanting song, which the others joined at intervals. After this it would seem that they turned into the night, for no further sound came from their direction, and the whispering stillness became more and more profound. The clockwork takes steadily. The shrill hum of a mosquito explored the place, and grew shrill at, in indignation, that would house his ointment. Then the lantern went out, and all the observatory was black. It had shifted his position, presently, when the slow movement of the telescope had carried it far beyond the limit of his comfort. He was watching a little group of stars in the Milky Way, in one of which his chief had seen, or fancied, a remarkable colour variability. It was not a part of the regular work for which the establishment existed, and for that reason perhaps, woodhouse would deeply interested. He must have forgotten things to rest real. All his attention was concentrated upon the great blue circle of the telescope field. A circle powdered, so it seemed, with an innumerable multitude of stars, and all luminous against the blackness of its setting. As he watched, he seemed to see himself becoming corporeal, as if he too were floating in the ethospace. Incidentally remote was the faint red spot he was observing. Suddenly the stars were brought it out. A flash of blackness passed, and they were visible again. Clear, said woodhouse, must have been a bird. The thing happened again, and immediately after, the great cube shivered, as though it had been struck. Then the donor of the observatory resounded with a series of thunder and blows. The stars seemed to sweep aside, as the telescope, which had been on clans, swung around in a way from the slit of the roof. Great Scott, Clyde Woodhouse. What's this? Some huge vague black shape, with a flapping something like a wing, seemed to be struggling in the aperture of the roof. In another moment the slit was clear again, and the luminous haze of the Milky Way short warm and bright. The interior of the roof was perfectly black, and only a scraping sound marked the wear about to the unknown creature. Woodhouse had scrambled from the seat to his feet. He was trembling violently, and in a perspiration with a suddenness of the occurrence. Was a thing what ever it was, inside or out? It was big, whatever else it might be. Something shot across the skylight, and the telescope swayed. He started violently and put his arm up. It was in the observatory then, with him. It was clean to the roof apparently, what the devil was it. Could it see him? He stood for perhaps a minute in a state of stupid affection. The beast, whatever it was, clawed at the interior of the dome, and then something flat door-after into his face, and he saw the momentary gleam as starlight, on a skin-like oiled leather. His water bottle would not block his little table with a smash. The sense of some strange bird creature hovering a few yards from his face in the darkness was indescribably unpleasant to Woodhouse. As his thought returned, he concluded that it must be some night bird, or a large bath. At any risk he would see what it was, and pulling a match from his pocket, he tried to strike it on the telescope's seat. There was a smoking street, a phosphorescent light, the match fled for a moment, and he saw a vast wing sweeping towards him, a gleam of grey brown fur, and then he was struck in the face, and the match knocked out of his hand. The blow was aimed at his temple, and a claw tore sideways down to his cheek. He reeled and fell, and he heard the extinguish lantern smash, another blow followed as he fell. He was partly stunned. He felt his own warm blood stream after upon his face. Stinked, he felt his eyes have been struck at, and turning over on his face to save them, tried to crawl under the protection of the telescope. He was struck again upon the back, and he heard his jacket rip, and then the thing hit the roof of the observatory. The edge to star as he could between the Woodnesseat and the IPs of the instrument, and turned his body round so that it was chiefly his feet that were exposed. Like these he could at least kick, who was still in a mystified state. The strange beast banged about in the darkness, and presently clung to the telescope, making it sway and the gear rattle. Once it flattened near him, and he kicked out madly, and fell to soft body with his feet. He was horribly scared now. It must be a big thing to swing the telescope like that. He saw for a moment the outline of a head blacky against the star like, with sharply pointed upstanding airs and a crest between them. It seemed the hint of his biggest amastance, then he began to ball out as loudly as he could for help. At that the thing came down upon him again, as it did so his hand touched something beside it on the floor. He kicked out, and the next moment his ankle was gripped and held by a row of keen teeth. He yelled again, and tried to freeze leg by kicking with the other. Then he realized he had the broken water bottle at his hand, and snatching it. He struggled into a sicking position, and feeling in the darkness towards his foot, grips a velvety air, like the air of a big cat. He had seized the water bottle by its neck, and brought it down with a shivering crash upon the head of the strange beast. He repeated the blow, and then stabbed and jabs with the jagged end of it, in the darkness, where he judged the face might be. His small teeth relaxed their hold, and that once wood has pulled his leg breathe and kicked hard. He felt the sickening feel of firm bang giving under his boot. There was a tearing bite at his arm, and he struck over it at the face, as he judged, and hit that fur. There was a pause. Then he had the sound of claws, and the dragging of a heavy body away from him, over the observatory floor. Then there was silence, broken only by his own stopping breathing, and a sound like licking. Everything was black, except for the parallelogram of the blue skylight, with the luminous dust to stars, against which the end of the telescope now appeared in silhouette. He waited, as it seemed, an interminable time. Was the thing coming on again? He felt in his trousers pocket for some matches, and then won remaining. He tried to strike this, but the floor was wet, and its spatter went out. He cursed. He could not see where the door was situated, and his struggle here quite lost his bearings. The strange beast disturbed by the splutter of the match, against a move again. Time, cold wood house, with a sudden gleaming of Murth, but the thing was not coming at him again. He must have hurt it, he thought, with the broken bottle. He felt a dull pain in his ankle, probably he was bleeding there. He wondered if it was supporting if he tried to stand up. The night outside was very still. There was no sound of anyone moving. The sleepy falls had not heard those winged battering upon the dome, nor his shouts. There was no good wasting strength in shouting. The monster flat-tits wings, and startled him into a defensive attitude. He hit his elbow against the seat, and it fell over with a crash. He cursed this, and then he cursed the darkness. Suddenly the oblong patrist dial-like seemed to sway to him fro. Was he going to faint? It would never do to faint. He clenched his fists and set his teeth to hold himself together. Where had the door got to? It occurred to him that he could get his bearings by the stars visible through the skylight. The patrist stars he saw was in Sagittarius and southeastward. The door was north. Or was it north by west? He tried to think. If he could get the door open, he might retreat. It might be the thing was wounded. The suspense would beastly. Look here, he said. If he don't come on, I shall come at you. Then the thing began clambering up the side of the observatory, and he saw its black outline gradually brought out the skylight. Was it in retreat? He forgot about the door, and watched as the dark fiftied and creaked. Somehow he did not feel very frightened or excited now. He felt a curious sinking sensation inside him. The sharply defined patrified light, with a black form moving across it, seemed to be growing smaller and smaller. That was curious. He began to feel very thirsty, and yet he did not feel inclined to get anything to drink. He seemed to be sliding down a long funnel. He felt a burning sensation in his throat, and then he perceived it with broad daylight. And that one of the day-experiments was looking at him with a curious expression. Then there was the top of Taddy's face upside down. Funny fellow Taddy to go about like that. Then he grasped the situation better. And perceived that his head was on Taddy's knee, and Taddy was giving him brandy. And then he saw the eyepiece of the telescope with a lot of red smears on it. He began to remember. He had made this observatory an a pretty mess, said Taddy. The deac boy was beating up an egg in brandy. He would have took this and sat up. He felt a sharp twinge of pain. His ankle was tied up, so his arm and the side of his face. The smashed glass red stained lay about the floor. The telescope sheet was overturned, and by the opposite wall was a dark pool. The door was open, and he saw the gray summit of the mountain against a brilliant background of blue sky. Pa, said woodhouse. Who's been killing calves here? Take me out of it. Then he remembered the thing, and the fight he had had with it. What was it? He said Taddy. The thing I fought with. You know that best, said Taddy. But anyhow, don't worry yourself now about it. How some more to drink. Taddy however was curious enough. And there was a hard struggle between duty and inclination to keep woodhouse quiet until he would decently put away in bed. And had slept upon a copious dose of meat extract Taddy considered advisable. They then talked to over together. It was, said woodhouse, more like a big bat than anything else in the world. It had sharp short ears, and soft fur, and its wings were leathery. Its teeth were a little bit devils sharp, and its jaw could not have been a very strong one, or else it would have bitten through my ankle. It has pretty nearly said Taddy. It seemed to me to hit out with its claws pretty freely. That is about as much as I know about the beast. A conversation was intimate, so to speak, and yet not confidential. The DAppchaps talk about a big collugo, a clang who tang, whatever that may be. It does not often attack men, but I suppose you made it nervous. They say there is a big collugo and a little collugo, and it is something else that sounds like cobbled. They all fly about at noise. For my own part, I know there are flying foxes and flying lemurs about here, but they are none of them, very big beasts. There are more things in heaven and earth, said woodhouse, and Taddy ground at the quotation. And more particularly in the forest of Borneo, than our drent tov in our philosophies. On the whole, if a Borneo-Forn is going to discord, any more of its novelty to Pondy, I prefer that it did say when I was not occupied in the observatory at night and all around.

Short Ghost and Horror Collection 033,Various,166039,4.0,"May 31, 2019",[],0,"org. Recording by Steve Mann. The Cats of Althar by HP Lovecraft. It is said that an Althar, which lies beyond the river sky, no man may kill a cat. And this I can barely believe, as I gaze upon him, who sit at the perring before the fire. For the cat is cryptic and close to strange things which men cannot see. He is the soul of antique adjiptus, and bearer of tales from forgotten cities of Maroan offer. He is the kin of the jungle's lords and heir to the secrets of Hory and Sinister Africa. The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language, but he is more ancient than the Sphinx, and he remembers that which she had forgotten. In Althar, before ever the Burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there dwelt an old cauter in his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbors. Why they did this I know not. Save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight. But whatever the reason this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel, and from some of the sounds heard after dark, many villagers fancy that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar, but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks as the back of an neglected yard. In truth, much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more, and instead of burating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished petter mouse or should stray to near the remote hovel under the dark trees. If through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed and sounds heard after dark, the loser would lament imbotantly, or console himself by thanking faith that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished. For the people of all thar were simple and knew not whence it was that all cats first came. When they a caravan of strange wanderers from the south ended the narrow cobbled streets of all thar, dark wanderers they were and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year. In the marketplace they told fortunes for silver and bought gay beads from the merchants. What was the land of these wanderers none could tell, but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that they had painted on the sides of their wagon strange figures with human bodies in the heads of cats, hawks, rams and lions, and the leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disk betwicks the horns. There was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother but only a tiny black kitten to cherish. The plague had not been kind to him, yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow, and when one is very young one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten. So the boy whom the dark people called meenies smiled more often than he wept as he sat playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon. On the third morning of the wanderer's stay in all thar, meenies could not find his kitten, and as he sobbed aloud in the marketplace certain villagers told him of the old man in his wife and of sounds heard in the night. And when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation and finally to prayer. He stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand, though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand. Since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming. It was very peculiar, but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy nebulis figures of exotic things of hybrid creatures crowned with horn flanked discs. Nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginative. That night the wanderers left all thar and were never seen again, and the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found. For each heart the familiar cat had vanished, cats large and small, black, gray, striped, yellow and white. Old crane and the burgermeister swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of meenies kitten and cursed the caravan in a little boy. But nith the lean notary declared that the old cauter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect. For their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold. Still no one burst complained to the sinister couple. Even when little atle the in-keeper's son vowed that he had a twilight seen all the cats of all thar and that a cursed yard under the trees, pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage to abreast, as if in performance of someone heard of right of beasts, the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy. And though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old cauter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard. So all thar went to sleep in vain anger and when the people awakened that dawn behold every cat was back at its accustomed hearth, large and small black gray stripe yellow and white, none was missing, very sleek and fat that the cats appear and sonorous with purring content. The citizens talked with one another of the affair and marveled not a little. Old crane and again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife, but all agreed on one thing that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious. And for two whole days the sleek lazy cats of all thar would touch no food, but only does by the fire in the sun. It was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage and of the trees. Then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away. In another week the burgamyster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thall the coutter of stone as witnesses. And when they had broken down the frail door they found only this. Two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earth and floor and the number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners. There was subsequently much talk among the burgis of all thar, zath the coroner disputed at length with nith the lean notary and crannon and shang and thall were overwhelmed with questions. Even little add all the in-keeper son was closely questioned and given a sweet meat as a reward. They talked of the old cauter and his wife of the caravan of dark wanderers of small mines in his black kitten of the prayer of mines in of the sky during that prayer of the doings of the cats the night the caravan left. And what was later found in the cottage end of the dark trees in the repellent yard.

The Big Blue Soldier,Grace Livingston Hill,122150,3.0,"March 10, 2019",[],0,"olunteer, please visit librvox.org. The Big Blue Soldier by Grace Livingston Hill. Chapter 1. And you don't think maybe I ought to have had lemon custard to go with the pumpkin instead of the mints. Miss Morilla Chadwick turned from her anxious watching at the kitchen window to search Mary Amber's clear young eyes for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Oh no, I think mints is much better. All men like mints pie. It's so sort of comprehensive you know. Miss Morilla turned back to her window satisfied. Well now if he came on that train, he ought to be inside around the bend of the road in about three minutes. She said tensely. I've timed it often when folks were coming out from town and it always takes just six minutes to get around the bend of the road. All through the months of the Great War, Miss Morilla had knitted and bandaged and emergency and caned teamed with an eager, wistful look in her dreamy gray eyes. And many a sweater had gone to some needy lad with a little thrilling remark as she handed it over to the committee. I keep thinking what if my nephew Dick should be needing one and this just come along in time? But when the war was over and most people had begun to use pink and blue wool on their needles or else cast them aside altogether and tried to forget their had ever been such a thing as war. And the price of turkey had gone up so high that people forgot to be thankful the war was over. Miss Morilla still held that wistful look in her eyes and still spoke of her nephew Dick with bayeded breath and a sigh. For wasn't Dick among those favored few who were to remain and do patrol work for an indefinite time in the land of the enemy while others were gathered to their waiting homes and eager loved ones. Miss Morilla spoke of Dick as one who still lingered on the border land of terror and who laid his young life a continuous sacrifice for the good of the Great World. A neat paragraph to that effect appeared in the spring haven chronicle, a local sheet that offered scant news items and fat platitudes at an ever increasing rate to a gullible and conceded populace. Who supported it because it was really the only way to know what one's neighbors were doing. The paragraph was the reluctant work of Mary Amber, the young girl who lived next door to Miss Morilla and had been her devoted friend since the age of four when Miss Morilla used to bake sugar cookies for her in the form of Stagie men with current eyes and outstretched arms. Mary Amber remembered nephew Dick as a young aunt of nine who'd made a whole long beautiful summer ugly with his torments. She also knew that the neighbors all around had memories of that summer when Dick's parents went on a western trip and left him with his Aunt Morilla. Mary Amber shrank from exposing her dear friend to the criticisms of such readers of the spring haven chronicle, as had memories of their cats tortured their chickens chased, their flower beds trampled, their children bullied, and their windows broken by the youthful Dick. But time had softened the memories of that fateful summer in Miss Morilla's mind, and besides, she was deeply in need of a hero. Mary Amber had not the heart to refuse to write the paragraph, but she made it as conservative as the circumstances allowed. But now, at last, among the latest to be sent back, Lieutenant Richard Chadwick's division was coming home. Miss Morilla read in the paper what day they would sail, and that they were expected to arrive not later than the twenty-night, and as she read, she conceived a wild and daring plan, why shouldn't she have a real life hero herself? A bit belated, of course, but all the more distinguished for that. And why shouldn't Mary Amber have a whole devoted soldier boy of her own for the village to see and admire? Not that she told Mary Amber that, oh no, but in her mind's vision, she saw herself, Mary Amber and Dick all going to church together on Sunday morning. The bars on his uniform gleaming like the light in Mary Amber's hazel eyes. Miss Morilla had one sudden pang of fear when she thought that perhaps he would not wear his uniform home, now that everybody else was in citizens clothing, then her sweet faith in the wholesomeness of all things came to her rescue, and she smiled in relief. Of course he would wear it to come home. That would be two outrageous not to when he had been a hero. Of course he would wear it in the first few days, and that was a good reason why she must invite him at once to visit her, instead of waiting until he had been to his home and been demobilized. She must have him in his uniform. She wanted the glory of it for her own brief share in that great time of uplifting and sacrifice that was so fast going into history. So Miss Morilla had hastened into the city to consult a friend who worked in the red cross and went out often to the warves to meet the incoming boats. This friend promised to find out just when Dick's division was to land, to hunt him up herself, and to see that he had the invitation at once. See that he came, she put in, with a wise reservation in her heart that the dear loving soul should not be disappointed. And now the very nights before, this friend had called Miss Morilla on the telephone to say that she had information that Dick's ship would dock at eight in the morning. It would probably be afternoon before he could get out to spring haven, so she had better range to have dinner about half past five. So Miss Morilla, with shining eyes and a heart that thrived like a young girl, had thrown her shawl over her shoulders and hastened in the twilight through the hedge to tell Mary Amber. Mary Amber, trying to conceal her inward doubts, had congratulated Miss Morilla and promised to come over the first thing in the morning to help get dinner. Promise also after much urging, almost with tears on the part of Miss Morilla, to stay and help eat the dinner afterward, in company with Miss Morilla and the young lieutenant. From this part of her promise, Mary Amber's soul recoiled, for she had no belief that the young leopard with whom she had played at the age of ten could have changed his spots in the course of a few years. Or even covered them with a silver bar. But Mary Amber soon saw that her presence at the dinner was an intrinsic part of Miss Morilla's joy in the anticipation of the dinner, and as much as she disliked the position of being flung at the young lieutenant in this way, she promised. After all, what did it matter what he thought of her anyway, since she had no use for him, and then she could always quietly freeze him whenever Miss Morilla's back was turned. Mary Amber could freeze with her hazel eyes when she tried. So quite early in the morning, Miss Morilla and Mary Amber began a cheerful stir in Miss Morilla's big sunny kitchen. Steadily appetizingly, they're grew in a ray of salads and pies and cakes and putings and cookies and donuts and biscuits and pickles and olives and jellies. While a great bird stuffed to bursting went through the seven stages of its final career to the oven. But no, it was five o'clock. The bird with brown and shining breast was waiting in the oven, done to a turn. Mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, suckatash and onions, had received the finishing touches and had only to be served. Crank berries, pickles, celery and jelly gave the final touches to a perfect table, and the sideboard fairly grown under its load of pies and cake. When my tough thought a whole regiment was to die with Miss Morilla Chadwick that day, from the sights and smells that filled the house. Up in the spare room the fire glowed in the Franklin heater and a geranium glowed in a west window between spotless curtains to welcome the guest. Now there was nothing left for the two women to do but the final anxiety. Mary Amber had her part in that, perhaps even more than her hostess and friend, for she was jealous for Miss Morilla and was youthfully incredulous. She had no trust in Dick Chadwick, even though he was an officer and had patrolled an enemy country for a few months after the war was over. Mary Amber had slipped over to her own house when she finished mashing the potatoes and changed her gown. She was putting little pets of butter on the bread and butter plates now, and the setting sun cast a halo of burnished light over her gold hair and brightened up the silk of her brown gown with its touches of wood red. She was beautiful to look upon as she stood with her butter knife, definitely cutting the squares and dropping them in just the right spot on the plates. But there was a troubled look in her eyes as she glanced from time to time at the older woman over by the window. Miss Morilla had ceased all thought of work and was intent only on the road toward the station. It seemed as if not until this moment had her great faith failed her and the thought come to her that perhaps he might not come. You know of course he might not get that train, she said meditatively. The other leaves only half an hour later but she said she'd tell him to take this one. That's true too, said Mary Amber cheerily and nothing will be hurt by waiting. I fixed those mashed potatoes so they won't get soggy by being too hot and I'm sure they'll keep hot enough. You're a good dear girl Mary Amber, said Miss Morilla giving her a sudden and pulse of kiss. I only wish I could do something great and beautiful for you. Miss Morilla caught up her shawl and hurried toward the door. I'm going out to the gate to meet him, she said with a smile, it's time he was coming in a minute now and I want to be out there without herring. She clamored down the steps her knees trembling with excitement, she hoped Mary Amber had not looked out the window, a boy was coming on a bicycle and if he should be a boy with a telegram or a special delivery letter she wanted to read it before Mary Amber saw her. Oh how awful if anything had happened that he couldn't come today. Of course he might come later tonight or tomorrow and a turkey would keep, though it was never so good as the minute it was taken out of the oven. The boy was almost to the gate now and yes, he was going to stop, he was swinging one leg out with that long movement that meant slowing up. She panted forward with a fertive glance back at the house. She hoped Mary Amber was looking at the turkey and not out of the window. It seemed that her fingers had suddenly gone tired while she was writing her name in that boy's book and they almost refused to tear open the envelope as the boy swung on his wheel again and vanished down the road. She had presence of mine's enough to keep her back to the house and the telegram in front of her as she opened it covertly, trying to keep the attitude of still looking eagerly down the road while the type written brief message got itself across to her tumultuous mind. Impossible to accept invitation, have other engagements, thanks just the same, signed, lieutenant Richard H. Chadwick. Ms. Marilla tore the yellow paper hastily and crumpled it into a ball in her hands as she stared down the road through Birmingham's. She managed an upright position but her knees were shaking under her and an empty feeling came in her stomach. Across the sunset skies and letters of accusing size, they're seemed to blaze the paragraphs from the spring Haven Chronicle, copied afterward in the country Gazette, about Ms. Marilla Chadwick's nephew. Lieutenant Richard H. Chadwick, who was expected at his aunt's home as soon as he landed in this country after a long and glorious career in other lands. And who would spend the weekend with his aunt and dapless be heard from at the spring Haven Clubhouse before he left. Her throat caught with a strange little sound like a groan, still with her hand grasping the front gate convulsively, Ms. Marilla stood and stared down the road, trying to think what to do. How to word a paragraph explaining why he did not come. How to explain to Mary Amber so that book of sweet and crudulousness should not come into her eyes. Then suddenly as she stared through her blur of tears, there appeared a straggling figure coming around the bend of the road by the hazard house. And Ms. Marilla, with nothing at all in her mind but to escape from the watchful loving eyes of Mary Amber for a moment longer, till she could think of what to say to her, staggered out the gate and down the road toward the person, whoever it was, that was coming slowly up the road. On stumbled Ms. Marilla, nearer and nearer to the oncoming man, till suddenly through a blur of tears she noticed that he wore uniform. Her heart gave a leap and for a moment she thought it must be dick, that he had been playing her a joke by the telegram and was coming on immediately to surprise her before she had a chance to be disappointed. It was wonderful how the years had done their halo work for dick with Ms. Marilla. She stopped short trembling, one hand to her throat, then as the man drew nearer and she saw his halting gate. Saw too, his downcast eyes and told to jack to daditude, she somehow knew it wasn't dick. Never would he have walked to her home in that way, there had been a swagger about the little dick that could not be forgotten. The older dick, crowned now with many honors would not have forgotten to hold his head high. Unconscious of her attitude of intense interest, she stood, with her hands still bledering at her throat and dies brightly on the man as he advanced. When he was almost opposite her, he looked up. He had fine eyes and good features, but his expression was bitter for once so young and in his eyes there was a look of pain. Oh, excuse me, said Ms. Marilla, looking around furtively to be sure Mari Amber could not see them so far away. Are you in a very great hurry? The young man looked surprised, amused, and slightly bored, but paused politely. Not specially, he said, and there was a tone of dry sarcasm in his voice. Is there anything I can do for you? He lifted the limp little trench cap and paused to rest as lame knee. Why? I was wondering if you wouldn't mind coming in and eating dinner with me, spoke Ms. Marilla eagerly, from a dry throat of embarrassment. You see, my nephews are returned soldier, and I've just got worried he can't come. The dinners all ready to be dished up, and it needed take long. Dinner sounds good to me, said the young man with a grim glimmer of a smile. I guess I can accommodate you, Madam. I haven't had anything to eat since I left camp last night. Oh, you poor child, said Ms. Marilla, beaming on him with a welcoming smile. Now isn't it fortunate that I should have asked you? As if there had been a throng of passing soldiers from which she might have chosen. But are you sure I'm not keeping you from someone else who is waiting for you? If there's anyone else waiting anywhere along the road for me, it's all news to me, Madam, and anyhow, you got here first, and I guess you have first rights. He had swung into the easy familiar vernacular of the soldier now, and for the moment his bitterness was held in a bayonth, and the really nice look in his eyes, shown forth. Well then, we'll just go along in, said Ms. Marilla, casting another quick glance toward the house. And I think I'm most fortunate to have found you, it's so disappointing to get dinner ready for company and then not have any. Must be almost as disappointing as to get all ready for dinner and then not have any, said the soldier, happily. Ms. Marilla smiled swiftly. I suppose your name does it happen to be Richard, does it? She asked, with that child is repeal in her eyes that had always kept her young woman and a good company for Mary Amber, even though her hair had long been gray. My just as well be that as anything else, he responded, happily, willing to step into whatever role was set for him in this most unexpected play. And you wouldn't mind if I should call you Dick, she asked, with a wistful look in her blue eyes. Like nothing better, he ascented glibly, and found his own heart warming to this confiding strange lady. That's beautiful of you, she put out a shy hand and laid it lightly on the edge of his cup. You don't know how much obliged I am, you see, Mary Amber has an ever-quite belief he was coming, Dick I mean, and she's been so kind and helped me get the dinner and all. I just couldn't bear to tell her he wasn't coming. The young soldier stopped short in the middle of the road and whistled. Horrors, he exclaimed in dismay, are there other guests? Who is Mary Amber? Why she's just my neighbor who played with you I mean with Dick, when he was here visiting as a child a good many years ago, I'm afraid he wasn't always as polite to her then as a boy ought to be to a little girl and well she's never liked him very well. I was afraid she would say I told you so if she thought he didn't come, it won't be necessary for me to tell any lies you know. I'll just say, Dick, this is Mary Amber, I suppose you don't remember her. And that will be all, you don't mind, do you? It won't take long to eat dinner. But I'm an terrible mess to meet a girl, he exclaimed unisily, looking down deprecatingly at himself. I thought it was just you, this uniform's three sizes too large and needs a drink, besides. He passed a speculative hand over his smoothly shave and chin. I hate girls, there was a deep frown between his eyes and the bitter look had come back on his face. Miss Marilla thought he looked as if he might be going to run away. Oh, that's all right, said Miss Marilla anxiously. Mary Amber hates men, she says they're all a selfish conceded lot, you need and have much to do with her, just eat your dinner and tell anything you want to about the war, we won't bother you to talk much. Come, this is the house and the turkey must be on the table getting cold by now. She swung open the gate and laid a persuasive hand on the shabby sleeve, and the young man reluctantly followed her up the path to the front door.

On the raft. Flossy, flossy, look at me. I'm having a steamboat ride. Oh, look. I am looking, Freddy Bobsy. No, you're not. You're playing with your doll. Look at me splash, flossy. A little boy with blue eyes and light curling hair was standing on a raft in the middle of a shallow pond of water, left in a green meadow after a heavy rain. In his hand, he held a long pole with which he was beating the water, making a shower of drops that sparkled in the sun. On the shore of the pond not far away and sitting under an apple tree, there was a little girl with the same sort of light hair and blue eyes as those which made the little boy such a pretty picture. Both children were fat and chubby and you would have needed but one luck to tell that they were twins. Now I'm going to sail away across the ocean, cried Freddy Bobsy, the little boy on the raft which he and a sister flossy had made that morning. By piling a lot of old boards and fence rails together. Don't you want to sail across the ocean, flossy? I'm afraid I'll fall off answered flossy, who was holding her doll off at arms length to see how pretty her new blue dress looked. I might fall in the water and get my feet wet. Take off your shoes and stockings like I did, flossy said the little boy. Is it very deep? Flossy wanted to know as she laid aside her doll. After all she could play with her doll any day, but it was not always that she could have a ride on a raft with Freddy. No answered the little blue-eyed boy. It isn't deep at all. That is I don't guess it is, but I didn't fall in yet. I don't want to fall in said flossy. Well I won't let you promise to brother, though how he was going to manage that he did not say. I'll come back and get you on the steamboat he went on and then I'll give you a ride all across the ocean and he began pushing the raft which he pretended was a steamboat back toward the shore where his sister sat. Flossy was now taking off her shoes and stockings which Freddy had done before he got on the raft and it was a good thing too for the water splashed up over it as far as his ankles and his shoes would surely have been wet, had he kept them on. Woe there stopped cried Flossy as she came down to the edge of the pond after having placed her doll and its new blue dress safely in the shade under a big bird-ock plant. Woe there seemed boat woe. You mustn't say woe to a boat objected Freddy as he pushed the raft close to the bank so his sister could get on. You only say woe to a horse or a pony. Can't you say it to a goat demanded Flossy? Yes, maybe you could say it to a goat Freddy agreed after thinking about it for a little while but you can't say it to a boat. Well, I wanted you to stop so you wouldn't bump into the shores at the little girl that's why I said woe. But you mustn't say it to a boat and this raft is the same as a boat and assisted Freddy. What must I say then while I wanted to stop? Freddy thought about this for a moment or two while a paddled his bare foot in the water. And he said, well you could say, halt maybe? Poo, halt is what you say to soldiers to Claird Flossy. We said that when we had a snow fort and played have a snowball fight in the winter. Halt is only for soldiers. Oh well, come on and have a ride when dawn Freddy. I forget what you say when you want a boat to stop. Oh, I know, Clyde Flossy clapping her hands. What? You just blow a whistle, you don't say anything. You just go too, too, and the boat stops. All right, agreed Freddy. Glad that this part was settled. When you want this boat to stop you just whistle. I will said Flossy, then she stepped on the edge of the raft nearest the shore. The boards and rails tilted to one side. Oh, oh, screened little girl, it's sinking. No, it isn't Freddy said it always does that when you first get on. Come on out in the middle and it will be all right. But it feels so, so funny on my toes said Flossy with a little shiver. It's tickly like. That's the way it was with me at first Freddy answered, but I like it now. Flossy wiggled her little pink toes in the water that washed up over the top of the raft, and then she said, well, I guess I like it too now, but it felt sort of squiggly at first. Squiggly was a word Flossy and Freddy sometimes used when they didn't know what else to say. A little girl moved over to the middle of the raft and Freddy began to push it out from shore. The rainwater pond was quite a large one and was deep in places, but the children did not know this. When they were both in the center of the raft, the water came only a little way over their feet. Indeed, there were so many boards, planks, and rails in the make-believe steamboat that it would easily have held more than the two smaller bobsy twins, where there was a double set of twins, as I shall very soon tell you. Isn't this nice ask Freddy as he pushed the pretend boat farther out toward the middle of the pond? awful nice, I like it said Flossy, I'm glad I helped you make this raft. It's a steamboat said Freddy, it isn't a raft. Well, steamboat then agreed Flossy, then suddenly she went, two, two, gear, what are you blowing the whistle now for, ask Freddy? We don't want to stop here, right in the middle of the ocean. I was only just trying my whistle to see if it would too explain the little girl, I don't want to stop now. Flossy walked around the middle of the raft, making the water splash with her bare feet, and Freddy kept on pushing it farther and farther from shore, yet Flossy was not afraid. Perhaps she felt that Freddy would take care of her. The little bobsy twins were having lots of fun pretending they were on a steamboat, when they heard someone shouting to them from the shore. Hi there, come and get us someone was calling to them. Who is it asked Freddy? It's Bert and Nan as with him, answered Flossy, as she saw a larger boy and girl standing on the bank near the tree under which she had left her doll. I guess they want to ride. Is the raft big enough for them too, Freddy? Yes, I guess so, he answered. You stop the steamboat, Flossy, and stop calling it a raft, and I'll go back and get them. We'll pretend their passengers, stop the boat. How can I stop the boat, the little girl demanded? Toot the whistle, toot the whistle answered her brother, don't you remember Flossy Bob'sy? Oh, said Flossy, then she went on. Toot, toot, toot answered Freddy. He began pushing the other way on the pole and the raft started back toward the shore they had left. What are you doing, Asa Bert Bob'sy, has the mass of boards and rails came closer to him. What are you two playing? Steamboat, Freddy, answered, if you want us to stop for you, why you've got to toot. Toot what, Asa Bert? Toot your whistle, Freddy replied, this is a regular steamboat, toot if you want me to stop. He kept on pushing with the pole until Bert with a laugh, made the tootings sound as Flossy had done. Then Freddy let the raft stop near his older brother and sister. Oh, Bert exclaim, Nan Bob'sy, are you going to get on? Sure, I am he answered, as he began taking off his shoes and stockings. It's big enough for the four of us. Where'd you get it, Freddy? It was partly made, I guess some of the boys from town must have started it. Flossy and I put more boards and rails on it, and we're having a ride. I should say you were laughed, Nan. Come on, said Bert to his older sister, as he tossed his shoes over to where Flossy's and Freddy's were set on a flat stone. I'll help you push, Freddy. Nan, who, like Bert, had dark hair and brown eyes, began to take off her shoes and stockings, and soon all four of them were on the raft, or steamboat as Freddy called it. Now you have met the two sets of the Bob'sy twins, two pairs of them as it were. Flossy and Freddy, the light-haired and blue-eyed ones were the younger set, and Bert and Nan whose hair was a dark brown matching their eyes were the older. This is a dandy raft, I mean steamboat said Bert. Quickly changing the word as he saw Freddy looking at him. It holds the four of us easy. Indeed the massive boards, planks and rails from the fence did not sink very deep in the water, even with all the Bob'sy twins on it. Of course, if they had worn shoes and stockings they would have been wet. For now the water came up over the ankles of all of them. But it was a warm summer day and going barefoot, especially while waiting in the pond, was fun. Bert and Freddy pushed the raft about with long poles, and Flossy and Nan stood together in the middle, watching the boys and making believe they were passengers, taking a voyage across the ocean. Back and forth across the pond went the raft's steamboat, when all of a sudden it stopped with a jerk in the middle of the stretch of water. Oh, cried Flossy, catching hold of Nan to keep herself from falling. Oh, what's the matter? Are we sinking, ask Nan? No, we're only stuck in the mud, Bert answered. You just stay there, Flossy and Nan, and you too, Freddy, and I'll jump off and push the boat out of the mud. It's just stuck, that's all. Oh, don't jump in, it's deep cried Nan, but she was too late. Bert quickly rolling as trousers up as far as they would go, had leaked off the raft, making a big splash of water.

The Actress in Highlight and Episode 1. 1. By Sue Petty Gruboan. Chapter 1. I was a traveler then, upon the more. I saw the hair that raised about with joy. I heard the woods in distant waters roar, or heard them not as happy as a boy. The pleasant season did my heart employ. My old remembrances went from me holy, and all the ways of men so vain and melancholy. By wordsworth. Gentle reader. Wherever you may be in bodily presence, when you cast your eyes on this page, let it for a few hours transport your complying spirit to a remote region and a bygone day. We may alter names without injury to our story, but every real character or event has its own time, place and accidents. To tear it from them is like transplanting a tree from its native spot. It must be trimmed and pruned and rubbed of its two proportions and its natural grace. Here then, on this lovely day near the end of the year 1812, you are in Alam Tahoe, the largest porous in an every-sense worst-people-trovments of Portugal. As its name implies, you are as-tellisment beyond the tiggus. Heson eastward over this sandy-arid plain, covered with a forest of stunted sea pines through whose tops the west wind glide with monotonous and melancholy mones fit music for the wilderness around you. Nor need you loiter on this desolate more, scantily carpeted with heats of different kinds and varying use. The drowsy tinkling of the cowbell amidst yonder brushwood, the goats spart of the clambering over that ledge of rocks, and those distant desky spots upon the downs which may be sheep, tell you that all life has not left the land. You may perchance on your journey, see a goat herd or a shepherd here or there. By rarer chants, you may meet some wayfair like yourself but is likely a robber as an honest man, and may find shelter at least in one of the few uncomfortable vendous the ratchadines the root of fords. You need not pause to gaze on many a wild scene some beautiful and even here in their fertile spot, nor loiter in this provincial town. Rich, perhaps, in mourish ruins, put in nothing else, but hasten onward till you reach that elevated point where the road, 100 miles from Lisbon, winds over the ridge of yonder hill. The chilly night winds of the peninsula have gone to sleep. Here, even in mid-winter, the sun of this hour shoots down scorching rays upon your head. Meet yourself by the roadside on this ledge of slayed rock at the foot of the cork oak, which so invitingly spreads out its sheltering arms. Here, while you take your breath, cast your eyes around you. You are no longer in the midst of broken desolate waste. To the south west rises the sadodosa. Its sides clothe with every green oaks and a dense growth of underbrush shalltering the wolf and the wild boar, while the northern slope of its rocky ridge is thatched with snow. For you is spread out the valley of the Guadiana. Soping downward toward the mighty stream, lie pasture, grow and field galeem mingle together. There to the east sits Elvis, on a lofty hill whose sides are covered with vineyards, all of yards and orchards, and just north of it, on and yet loft your peak with a deep narrow valley lying between them, stands the crowning castle of Lalypa, the strongest fortress and Portugal. Or beyond, but plainly seen through the clear atmosphere of the peninsula, now doubly transparent since it has been purified by the heavy rains which hear usher in the winter rises the blue mountain of Albuquerque, far away in Spanish as dramathura. Whichever way you look, searas, nearer or more distant, tower above the horizon, or fringets at most verge. Among these scenes of nature's handiwork, a production of human art demands your attention. On the on your right, the beginning of the ancient aqueduct reared by Mauritans, which leads the pure mountain stream for three miles across the valley to the city seated on the hill. Here the masonry is but a foot or two above the ground. Below, the road will lead you under its three tiers of arches with the water gliding and hundred feet above your head. But here comes a native of this region to enliven if not adorn the landscape. This lean swore the young fellow under his somber arrow with ample brim exhibits a fair specimen of the peasant's effelum taeho. His sheepskin jacket hangs loosely from his shoulders and between his nether garment and his clumsy shoes, he displays the greater part of a pair of sinewy legs, which would be brown where they not so well-powtered with a slate desk of the rocky road he travels. With a long, gold heurges on the panting beast yoke to the rudest of all vehicles, the ballacard of Portugal. This low wheels made of solid wooden blocks are fastened to the axle tree, which turns with them and at every step squeaks out complaining notes under the burden of a cask of the muddy and little prized wine of the province, which is seeking a market at Elvis. The character is now overtaken by a peasant girl who with basket on her arm has been gathering chestnuts and balotas in the wood. They are no strangers to each other and she exchanges her brisk elastic step for a pace better suited to that of the Tarling oxen. The beauty of this desky bell consists of a smiling mouth, bright black eyes and youth and health. Though fond of goddy cutters, she is not overdressed. A light handkerchief rather binds her a ribbon hair than covers her head. Her bright blue peticote, scanty and length, and her orange-cuttered Spencer open in front both well-worn, and showing here in their arent, but half concealed the graces of her form, and a pair of nimble feet, scorning the tramels of leather, picked their way skillfully along the stony path. That she does not contaminate ornament is shown by her one small golden earring, long since divorced from its mate, and the devout faith which glows in her bosom as symbolized by the little silver image of our lady, slung from her neck by a silk-and-cord spun by her own silkworms and twisted by her own hands. In short, she is neither beautiful, nor noble, nor rich. But her company seems instantly to smooth the road and lighten the toils of travel to her swaying. He helps himself, unasked, out of her basket, and urges her to partake of the stars of his leathered wallet, hard-goats-cheese, and the crumbling loaf of broa, or maize-bred. Soon in deep and sweet conference in their craved but expressive tongue, he forgets to make occasional use of his gold, and thus keeping pace with the loid-wing-bulk's they go leisurely along. Let them pass on and wait for better game. Turn, and look at this cavalcade, twirling up toward you. A sudden bend in the road has brought it into view, and its aspect half-native half-form, its mix-sible and military character attract attention. Two mounted ordodies in a British uniform lead the way, and are followed by a clumsy Lisbon coach every part of it well-laden with luggage. It is drawn by four noble murals, such as our seldom-seeing note of the peninsula, deserving more stylish pustillians than those who, in ragged jackets, greasy leather and breeches, and huge jack boots are urging them on. Two men sit at ease on the coach box. One at a young fellow looks at a distance like a field officer in a flashy uniform, but is only an English footman in a godly livery who needs the training of a London winter or two in a fashionable household to make him a flunky of the first water. The other and old man, with a severe countenance, is plainly dressed, but with a less brilliant exterior as a more respectable air than his companion. He too is the man in authority, as from time to time he directs the party and urges them on in somewhat impatient tones. If you are familiar with the country and the times, you may imagine that some British general officer has been so long in the peninsula that he has adopted the style and equipage of questa, and some other Spanish leaders, and followed into their habits of slow and dignified motion. She will think at high time for him to be sent home, that someone less luxurious and stately but more alert and energetic may fill his place. One look into the coach will undecive you. Its chief occupant is a lady, whose ears do not exceed 19, and she is evidently no native of Alam Tahoe, nor of Portugal, and she might have been sent out hither as a specimen of what a more northern country can occasionally produce. While she looks out with deep yet lively interest on the scenery before and around her, you naturally gaze with deeper interest only upon her. Her companion is her maid, some years older than herself, who might be worth looking at where her mistress out of the way. One of the orderlies turning in his saddle now points out the city to the old man, who in turn, leans over to the coach window and calls out, my lady, there is Elvis. And my father is an Elvis. She leans eagerly out of the window, but the front of the clumsy vehicle obstructs the view and she calls out, stop the coach moody and let me out. I will not go one step further until I have taken a good look at Elvis. The old man testily orders a halt. The footman opens the door and the lady springs lightly out, followed by her maid. Nick lecting all other objects in sight, she gays as long and eagerly at the city seated on the hill. The interest she shows is no longer merely that of observant curiosity, but is prompted by the gushing affections of the heart. In Elvis, besides much new and strange, there is something known and loved. She now begins to question the orderlies as to the exact spot where her father has quarded himself, but the old man interrupts her. You have traveled a long way, my lady, to get to Elvis, but you will never reach it while you stand looking at it inspiring about it. Very true, old wisdom. How comes it that you are always in the right? Let us push on now and in an hour, she exclaims stepping into the coach. I will see my father for the first time since I was 14. The coach moves on but too slowly for her. Leaning out of the window and surveying the road, she calls out galey. Our way lies down hillmoody and they tell me that news are so surefitted that in every stumble, pray by our borrow that long-goed from the young gentleman in the sheepskin jacket, by a skillful use of it you might mend our pace and bring us sooner to Elvis. We will leave this impatient lady to hasten on to Elvis, whether expedited or not by the use of the gold, to inquire at the occasion of her journey thither. For five years, the peninsula has been one battle field, and the present has been one of unsheacing activity to the British troops. During the year by suddenly crossing the frontier and investing sea-o-dad Rodrigo, they had taken it by storm in January, while the French were preparing to relieve it. Equally unexpectedly crossing the Tegas and the Guadiana, they had sat down before the strong fortress of the Badahos, and to save a few precious days in which suit and mow mow might have united their hosts to its rescue, they in April took it in a bloody assault by an immediate possession of the price of more than 1,000 precious lives. No sooner had the disappointed marshals withdrawn their armies to let exhausted regions, then the force of almarez were surprised in May, and the direct route of communication between them cut off. The British army then invaded Spain on the side of the kingdom of Lyon. The forts of Salamanca fell before them in June, and in July the Battle of Salamanca crushed the French force in that quarter, and opened the road to Madrid to the British who driving thence the ensues of King acquired the control of all central Spain. But at length, in October, the castle of Burtgos defied their utmost efforts unated by a siege train. The French hosts from north, south, and east, abandoning which province's anstronch fortress as they had held for years gathered around them in overwhelming numbers, and slowly, reluctantly, and with many a stubborn halt, the English general retraced his steps towards Portugal. The prostrated strength of both armies put an end to their campaign. The French gave up the pursuit being too hungry to march further, or to fight anymore. And the discipline and appetite to the British soldiers were indicated on their march through the forest, bordering the Huoebra, by the fuselade opened on the herds of swine, which were fattening on the acorns there. For a moment, their commander thought himself surprised, and that the country, for miles around, was the scene of one wide-spread skirmish with the foe. Even hanging a few of his men did not put a stop to the disorder. In November, the troops were permitted to pause for rest in the neighborhood of Ciudad Rodrigo, with their energies prostrated, and their discipline relaxed to the siege and battles. The continual marches, the exposure and the want of campaign so long and arduous as this. Strange it seemed to them, after going so far and doing and suffering so much, that they should end the campaign where they had begun it. Yet, they had done much. Renching the larger and richer half of Spain out of the grasp of the French, and changing their possession of the country to a mere invasion of it. Such toil's need long rest. Privations and sufferings like theirs should be repaid by no scanty measure of plenty and enjoyment. The troops went into winter quarters, chiefly between the duro and the Tegas, but as an army in this country is always in danger of starvation, a brigade was sent over into Alamtejo at once to make themselves comfortable and to facilitate getting up supplies from her province which now had something in it. As for four years, the French had been kept out of it. Accordingly, it was absolutely refreshing to see the liberal provision made for the almost insatiable wants of this brigade, for among them, our story lies. They prove themselves good soldiers to a man in their zeal to refresh and strengthen themselves against the next campaign by enjoying to the full, have a good thing within their reach. The officers, especially Rans act at the country for every commodity they could promote enjoyment and what Alamtejo could not furnish, Lisbon and London must provide. Nothing was too costly for their purses, no place too distant for their search. Doubtless, the veterans of the greatest of all great captains were permitted for a time to run a free and joyous career in Capua. In this brigade, besides having a little corner of Portugal to themselves, somewhat out of sight of the command to enchief and of Sir Roland Hill, enjoyed the further advantage of being led by a good soldier in the field, and a free liver in Garrison and Capua, who looked upon his men in winter quarters, after a heart-campaign, somewhat in the light of schoolboys in the holidays and was willing to see the liads enjoy themselves freely. Lord Strathern, a veteran somewhat the worse for where had entered the army a cadet of a scotch family, more noble than Mitch. At length, the obliging death of a cousin brought him a scotch-pearage and an estate little adequate to support that dignity. High rank and an arrow estate form an inconvenient union. So he stuck to the profession which he loved and being a widow or entrusted his only child a daughter to a sister in Scotland. Though he had seen little of domestic life, he was an affectionate man. The briskness of the last campaign and the number of his friends who dropped off in the course of it strongly warned him that if he would once again see his daughter now attaining womanhood it would be well to lose no time about it. So one morning during the retreat from Borgos, after issuing the brigade orders for the day, he penned an order to his sister in Scotland to send out the young lady with proper attendance under the care of the way for any officer of rank who might be sailing for this man. There she would be within reach and he might find letter to visit her. His sister would have protested against this as she had an opportunity, but the order of the father and the affectionate and adventurous spirit of the daughter at once decided the matter. On her arrival however in Lisbon, her father was too busy establishing his brigade uncomfortable quarters to meet her there, and the military horizon giving promise of a quiet winter he summoned her to join him at Elvis. The brigade had been for some weeks living in Clover in their modern capital when Lady Mabel Stewart joined her father. A Portuguese provincial town with its filthy streets and squalid populace could be no agreeable place of residence to a British lady. Lord Strathern felt this and looking about him found a large building in the midst of an orchard without the walls of Elvis and more than halfway down the hill. It had been erected by one of the monastic societies of the city as a place of occasional retirement for pleasure or devotion or both. The French had some early turn the out of it five years before and so thoroughly plundered them at the same time that they had not since found hard or means to repair and refurnish it. Accordingly it was a good deal dilapidated, but the refactory and the kitchen took his large up side. The former could die and have the officers of the brigade at a time and the latter allowed a bundled double room to cook since collions while preparing the feast. So here he established the headquarters of his brigade and here Lady Mabel Stewart made her appearance in the new dignity of womanhood to preside over his household.

There are chaps you know who have never seen the edge of a thing called life, and have never known of the challenge thrown in the darkness of the strife. There's a land we knew in the days of old when we trudged the wilderness. To us the land of pain, with the brand of cane, the home of the loneliness. We had cursed it off with the blackest curse, a reckless and capitalist lot, and headed our letters for going home, the country that God forgot. We had all been out since the early spring, and things had been going wrong, and it seemed that misfortune had dogged our trail each day as it dragged along. It appeared to be as an alien land for sick and by God in man. Till we heard the voice of the one who gave it birth when the world began. We had cursed that day more than air before, as fellows and anger do, and astroom that gathered above us broke, soaking us through and through. As we trampt it back to the lonely camp, it seemed the place was bad. And brown, with an awful curse, had said, the devil controls the land. Then the thunder rolled in the lightning flashed with this wondrous, lured glow, and we who had challenged the wilderness wandered the earth below. It seemed that a message was from above the knowledge of endless things, the power that quickens the soul of man, and models the hearts of kings. I remember, as though, to where yesterday the lesson we learnt that night, the answer that broke on our startle the years, the voice from the ribbon height. The God we had challenged with angry words was guarding and watching yet, and loving the wilderness we had cursed, the God who could not forget. He knew of the lonely location crew away in the shadowed past. He knew of the road we had come to build, reserving it to the last. He knew we would say he had long forgotten the earth in Thurstyland, but spoke from the heavens that night to show, to us even as he had planned.

We were Scunner Rigged in Rikish with a long and listen-hole. And we flew the pretty colors of the crossbones in the skull. We'd a big black jolly Roger flapping grimly at the four, and we sailed the Spanish water in the happy days of your. We'd a long brass gun and midships like a well-conducted ship. We had a brace of pistols and a cutlass at the hip. It's a point which tells against us and a fact to be deplored, but we chased a goodly merchant man and laid their ships aboard. Then the dead men found the scuppers and the wounded filled the chains. And the paintwork always splattered ash with other people's brains. She was boarded, she was looted, she was scuddled till she sank, and the pale survivors left us by the medium of the plank. Oh, then it was, while standing by the taffrail on the poop. We could hear the drowning folk lament the absent chicken coop. Then having washed the blood away, we'd little else to do, and dance a quiet hornpipe as the old salts taught us to do.

The War of the Worlds (Version 4),H. G. Wells,107318,3.0,"July 24, 2019",[],0,"please visit librevox.org. The War of the World by H.G. Wells. But who shall dwell in these worlds if they be inhabited? Well, we, will they, Lords of the World? And how are all things made for man? Kepler. Quoted in the anatomy of melancholy. Book 1, The Coming of the Martians. Chapter 1, The Eath of the War. No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century that this world was being watched, keenly and closely, by intelligence is greater than man's, than yet as mortal as it own. The Azmen design themselves, about their various concerns, they were scrutinised and studied. Perhaps, almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a dropper water. With infinite complacency men went too in fro over this globe, about their little affairs, so reigning their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the MPs are under the microscope to the same. No one gave a thought to the older world to space, as sources of human danger. Well thought to them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men fancy them are the men upon mass. Perhaps inferior to themselves, and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the Gulf of Space. Things that are to our minds, as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, into exvarced and cool and unsympathetic. Regarding this earth, within the Azais, and slowly and surely, through their plans against us. And early in the 20th century came the great disillusionment. The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of the 140 million miles. And the light and heat, every season the sun, is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebula hypothesis has any truth, older than our world. And long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one-centred of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water, and all that is necessary for the support of an emated existence. Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the very end of the 19th century, expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed their far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood, that since Mars is older than our earth, we scarcely a quarter of the superficial area, and remote from the sun. It necessarily follows, that it is not only more distant from times of beginning, but nearer its end. The secular cooling that must, someday, overtake our planet, has already gone far indeed with our neighbour. The aesthetic condition is still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region, the midday temperature barely approaches out of our coldest winter. Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans so shrunk, until they cover but a third of its surface. And as its slow season change, huge snow caps gather and melt about either pole, and periodically inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which towards is still incredibly remote, has become a present day problem for the inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellect, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And looking across space with instruments and intelligences such as we have scarcely green off, they see, at its nearest distance only 35 million of miles summed up, a morning star of hope, our own warm planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere, eloquent of fertility. With glimpses through its drifting cloud-wisp, of broad stretches of populous country, and narrow, navy-crowded seas. And we, men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as other monkeys and humans to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incestance struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its calling, and this world is still crowded with life. But crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare somewhere is indeed, the only escape from the destruction that generation after generation creeps upon them. And before we judge them too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has rot, not only upon animals, such as the vanish-bison and dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination, wage by European immigrants, in the space of 50 years. But we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians ward in the same spirit. The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety. Their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of hours, and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nipurfect unanimity. At our instruments permitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the 19th century. Men like Skiafer Early watched the Red Planet. It is ordered by the Bay, that recountless centuries, Mars has been the star of war. But failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they map so well. All that time, the Martians must have been getting ready. During the opposition of 1894, a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disc. First at the liquor observatory, then by Parisian of Nes and then by other observers. English readers heard a bit first in the issue of nature dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun in the vast pits sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Piccolia markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the side to the outbreak during the next two oppositions. The storm burst upon a six years ago now, as Mars approached opposition. Lavelte of Java set the woes of the astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas on the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of the 12th, and the spectroscope to which he had at once resorted, indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal puff of flame, suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet. As flaming gasses rushed out of the gun, a singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers, except a little note in the daily telegraph, and the world went in ignorance of all of the gravestangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of the eruption at all, had I not met Ogilby, the well-known astronomer, and that Ottershore. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of his feelings, he invited me up to take a turn within that night in a scrutiny of the red planet. In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vehicle distinctly, the black and silent observatory, the shadow lantern, throwing a fee bulk of that over the floor in the corner. The steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof, an oblong profundity with the stardust rigged to clutter. Ogilby moved about, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, once all a circle of deep blue, and the little round planets swimming in the field. It seems such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flaccant from the perfect round. But so little it was, so silvery warm, a pinched head of light. It was as if it quibbed, but really this was the telescope by braiding with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view. As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller, and to advance and received, but that was simply that my eye was tired. 40 million of miles it was from us, more than 40 million miles of void. Few people realised the immensity of vacancy, in which the dust of the material universe swims. We were in the field, I remember, with three faint points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder, and invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me, across that incredible distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the thing that was sending us. The thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched, no one on earth dreamed of that unairing missile. That night too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet. I saw it, a reddish splash at the edge, the slages' projection of the outline, just as the chronometers struck midnight, and at that I told O'Gorby, and each took my place. The night was warm, and I was thirsty, and I went, stretching my legs clumsily, and feeling my way in the darkness, to the little table where this ice-n-stood, while O'Gorby exclaimed that the streamer of gas that came out towards us. That night, another invisible missile, started on its way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so under 24 hours after the first one. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the mind you glee might see, and all that it would presently bring to me. O'Gorby watched till one, and then gave it up, and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house. Down below in the darkness were otters short and shirtsy, and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace. He was thought a speculation that night, about the condition of Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signaling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge vulcanic explosion was in progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organically evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets. The chances, against anything mankind on Mars, are a million to one, he said. Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night, and the night after about midnight, and again the night after, and so for ten nights, a flame each night. Other short ceased after ten, no one on earth has a tentative to explain. It may be the gases of the firing, cause the Martians in Cominians. Den's cloud of smoke called us, visible through a powerful telescope on earth, as little grey fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's atmosphere, and a obscured is more than a million features. Even todayly papers will cut to the disturbances at last, and popular notes appeared, there, and everywhere, concerning the volcano as upon Mars. The serial comic of Periological Punch, I remember, made a happy use of it in the political cartoon, and all unsuspected. Those missiles and Martians had fired at us, through earthward, rushing now to pace of many miles a second through the empty Gulf of Space, hour by hour, and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now, almost incredibly wonderful, that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days, people in these latter times, scarcely realised the abundance and enterprise of our 19th century papers. From my own part, I was much occupied in learning to write the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers, discussing the probable developments, of moral ideas, as civilisation progressed. One night, the first missile then could scarcely have been 10 million miles away. I went through a walk with my wife. It was starlight, and I explained the signs of the zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping as an effort, towards which so many telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of excursionists from churchy or arreworth past us, singing and playing music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed. From the railway station in a distance, came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost intermerely by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green and yellow signal lights, hanging in the framework against the sky. It seems so safe, and tranquil.

She was a pale child with black hair which she wore in curl rags from Friday night till Sunday morning. Her mother was poor and token washing. Because besides Amelia Ann, who was the eldest, there were some five other little stiggins' to feed. Now what happened one day just before Christmas that the five little stiggins' had coads in their heads, so Mrs. Stiggins sat them in a ring in the kitchen with their feet and a tub of mustard and water. After that, she put them into a big bed and gave them hot gruel to drink. She fell Amelia Ann stood gloomily by and shook her head which was covered with curl rags. The reason for the curl rags was that all the village children had been invited to a grand tea party at the squires the next day. And Amelia Ann was gloomy because it did not seem as if the five little stiggins' would be able to go. Sure enough, the next day the coads were worse and at three o'clock in the afternoon and Amelia Ann's hair was taken out of the rags and she put on her Sunday dress and coat and hat and started off to the tea party with 25 ringlets bobbing round her neck. And the five little stiggins' sat up in the big bed and howd horribly with disappointment. But Amelia Ann had hardly gotten out of the front door before she was back again. I want the umbrella, she said, and she took it from the corner in the parlor where it lived. It was large and green with a goose's head for a handle. It's never going to rain Amelia Ann. I said, Mrs. Diggins, whatever do you want to take the umbrella for? I don't know. But Amelia Ann tossed her head and said she wasn't so sure about the rain and she started off again with the green umbrella clasped in one arm. The squire was a jolly old man with a round red face and a beard like father Christmas. But the squire's sister, Ms. Josephine, was a cross-old maid and she thought it was a stupid thing to give a tea party to the village children. She was always there to see that they behaved themselves. Now Ms. Josephine's eagle eye was upon Amelia Ann as she took her seat at the great long table with the other children and Amelia Ann's stiggins. She said, what are you doing with that great umbrella in here? You ought to have left it in the hall with your coat and hat. Oh, nothing, please, Mom. Stamard Amelia Ann, trying to hide the umbrella under the table. Ms. Josephine stared very hard at her and then went on to find fault with somebody else. What a tea that was. There were cakes with pink icing and cherries on the top and jammed hearts that melted in one's mouth and biscuit with creamy insides and scones and bones and bones. Amelia Ann seemed to be terribly hungry for her plate was nearly always empty but though she did not reach out and help herself, she was never allowed to wait long because there was a great many smiling maids to pass the cakes and fill up the tea cups. When she was over the children went back to the hall and put on their hats and coats. As they went out, a smart footman at the door gave each child an orange and apple in a bag of sweets. Amelia Ann took her orange and apple and bag of sweets and said, thank you, sir. Amelia Ann was almost the last to go because she had taken the wrong hat and had to go back into the house. She was ready to go through the door again when suddenly Miss Josephine stepped forward. Amelia Ann stiggins, she said, I will put up your umbrella for you and she took it firmly out of Amelia Ann's hand. Oh mom! Criter Amelia Ann and clutch Miss Josephine's arm. But Miss Josephine shook her off and held out the umbrella and shot it open and out upon the floor and the bright light that came from the hall lamp fell jammed hearts and iced cakes and biscuits and scones. Criterie de Child said Miss Josephine, and Amelia Ann covered her face with her hands and wept. But the square looked down at the feast on the floor and padded Amelia Ann kindly on the shoulder. Come, come. He said, it was your own to you, put in the umbrella. I know because I watched you and you never ate anything at all. Oh, sir, Criter Amelia Ann uncovered her face. I'm glad you saw because I didn't take a bit more than what I could easily have ate. And the five of them scutt colds in their heads and when I left them they were all howling something awful and I couldn't bear to go home and tell them everything and them not have a bite as you might say, well, well. So this wire, I thought there was somebody missing. And of course there will be five, two's left over and I think we could find a sixth as this one is spoiled. Gone to the smart footman, a basket to please with cakes for six people. And John went like a shot while Miss Josephine dropped the umbrella and walked slowly past Amelia Ann in the square with her nose in the air and a look of horrified disgust on her face. And two minutes John was back again with a huge basket covered with a white cloth and 15 minutes later Amelia Ann staggered into the Stiginson's house and upstairs to the bedroom with a huge basket on one arm and the green umbrella clutched in the other and the five little Stiginson sat up and bed with her eyes nearly starting out of their heads and Missestiginson sat bump upon a chair because she said it gave her quite a turn when Amelia Ann took off the cover of the basket. For inside that basket we're cakes enough for six and Missestiginson's as well an orange and apples and bags of sweets and when everybody had finished Amelia Ann was sure that she must have eaten quite twice as much as she had meant to bring home in the green umbrella.

In days of old when all things in the wood head speech, they lived within its depths alone in Flaxfinner. She was a bent old creature and ill to look upon, but all the tongues of all the forest leaves were ever kept wgging, with the story of her kindly deeds. And even to this day they sometimes whisper lower among themselves, because they fain would hold in mind so sweet a tale. The story of her kindness to the little orphan orger. Trus no slight task the old Flaxfinner took upon herself. The day she brought the helpless child to share the shelter of her fathach. The oak outside her door held up his arms and solemn protest. Though dost but waste thy soul, he said. Thy benefits will be forgot, thy labors unrequited, for you there's ever but another title for ingratitude. Nay, friend, the old Flaxfinner said. My little ogre will not be ungrateful and forgetful. All hedged about with loving care, the orphan grew to gracious maidenhood and felt no lack of father, mother, brother, or sister. In every way the old Flaxfinner took their places, but many with the sacrifices that she made to keep her fed and warmly clad, and every time she went without herself that all go might receive a greater share. Why's Acoroke looked down and frowned and shook his head. Then would the old Dame hastened to her in a room, and there she pricked herself with her spindle, until a great red drop of her heart's blood fell into her trembling hand. With which reaverged she blew upon it, enrolled it in her palm, enmuttering, turned and turned and turned it, and as the spell was laid upon it, it tripled into a tiny round ball like a seed, and she strung it on a thread, where were many others like it saying. By this she will remember, she will not be ungrateful and forgetful. So years went by, and ogre grew in goodness and in beauty, and helped the old Flaxfinner and her tasks, as blindly in this willingly, is if she were indeed her daughter. Every morning she brought water from the spring, gathered the wild fruits of the woods, and spread the linen on the grass to bleach. At such times with the bent-old foster mother hold herself erect, and call up to the oak, dost-see, that wrong, you this not another title for ingratitude. Though hush not lived as long as I would be the only answer. One day is ogre was wandering by the spring, searching for water curses, the young prince of the castle rode by on his prancing charger. A snow-white plume waved in his heart, in a shining silver-bugle hung from his shoulder, free of unfollowing the chase. He was thirsty and tired and asked for a drink, but there was no cup with which to dip the water from the spring, but ogre caught the drops as they bubbled out from the spring, hauling them in the hollow of her beautiful white hands, and reaching up to where he sat, offered him the sparkling water. So gracefully was it done, that the prince was chombed by her modest manner, as well as her lovely face, and bearing his head when he had slaked his thirst, he touched the white hands with his lips. Before he rode away, he asked her name and where she lived. The next day, a currier and scarlet and gold stopped at the door of the cottage, and invited ogre to the castle. Princesses and royal ladies from all over the realm were to be entertained there, seven days and seven nights. Every night a grand ball was to be given, and ogre was summoned to each of the balls. It was because of her pleasing manner and her great beauty that she had been bitten. The old flack spin a curtsy'd-low to the courier, and promised that ogre should be at the castle without fail. But good-dame! Criteral go on the currier had gone. Pretty tell me why thou didst make such a promise? Knowing full well this gown of toe is all I own. Wouldst have me stand before the prince and beggars gap? Better to bite at home for I than be put to shame before such guests. Have done my child, the old-dame said. Thou shalt wear a court robe of the finest. Years have I toil to have it ready, but that is not. I love thee as my own. Then once more the old flack spin a went into her in a room. And prick to self with her spindle till another great red drop of her heart's blood fell into a trembling hand. With which re of words she blew upon it and rolled it in her palm, and muttering, turned and turned and turned it. And as the spell was laid upon it, it tripled into a tiny round ball like a seed, and she strung it on a thread, where were many others like it. Seventy-time seven was the number of beads on this strange rosary. When the night of the first ball rolled around, ogre combed her long golden hair and twined it with a wreath of snowy water lilies, and then she stood before the old-dame and her dress of toe. To her wonderment and grief she saw there was no silken robe in waiting, only a string of beads to clasp around her white throat. Each bead in the necklace was like a little shriveled seed, and ogres eyes filled with tears of disappointment. O'Baynee and all will be well,"" said the old woman. When now reaches the castle gate. Clasp one bead in thy fingers and say, for love sweet sake in my hour of need, blossom in deck me little seed. Straight away right royally shut that beclad, but remember carefully the charm. Only to the magic words full of sweet sake with a necklace give up its treasures. If thou shudst forget, then now must be doomed all is to wear thy gown of toe. So ogres sped on her moonlighted way through the forest, until she came to the castle gate. There she paused, and grasping a bead of the strange necklace between her fingers, repeated the old-dame's charm. For love sweet sake in my hour of need, blossom in deck me little seed. Immediately the bead burst with little puff. It's if a seed pod had snapped a sunder. A faint perfume surrounded her, rare and subtle as if it had been blown across from some flower of Eden. Ogle looked down, and found herself enveloped in a robe of such delicate texture, that it seemed soft as a rose leaf, and as the airy as pink clouds, that sometimes flowed across the sunset, the water lilies in her hair had become a core and all of opals. When she entered the great ballroom, the prince of the castle started up from his throne in amazement. Never before had he seen such a vision of loveliness. Surely, said he, some rose of paradise have found a soul, and drifted earthward to blossom here. And all that night he had eyes for none but her. The next night Ogle started again to the castle in her dress of toe, and at the gate she grasped the second bead in her fingers, repeating the charm. This time the pale yellow of the daffodils seemed to have woven itself into a cloth of gold for her adorning. It was like a shimmer of moon beams, and her hair held the diamond flashings of a hundred tiny stars. That night the prince paid her so many compliments, and singled her out so often to bestow his favours that Ogle's head was turned. She tossed it proudly and quite scorn the thought of the humble cottage, which had given her shelter so long. The next day, when she had returned to her gown of toe and was no longer a hearty court lady, but only Ogle, the flagspinners made and she repined at her lot. Frowning, she carried the water from the spring. Frowning, she gathered the creases and plucked the woodland fruit. And then she sat all day by the spring, refusing to spread the linen on the grass of the beach. She was discontented with the old life of toil, and pouted crossly because duties called her, when she wanted to do nothing but sit idly dreaming of the gay court scenes in which she had taken a bright brief part. The old flagspinners fingers trembled as she spun, when she saw the frowns, for she had given of her heart's blood to buy happiness for this maiden she loved, and while she knew there can be no happiness where frowns abide. She felt that her years of sacrifice had been in vain, but when the Ogle quagged his head, she called back waveringly. My little Ogle will not be ungrateful and forgetful. That night outside the castle gate, Ogle gaposed. She had forgotten the charm. The days discontented darkened her memory as storm clouds darkened the sky, but she crossed her necklace empiriously. Deck me at once, she cried in a hearty tone. Cloth me more beautifully than mortal maid was ever clad before, so that I may find favor in the princess side, and become the bride of the castle. I would that I would done forever with the spindle and the distaff, but the moon went under a cloud, and the wind began to moan around the turrets. The black nightharks in the forest flapped their wings warningly, and the black bats flitted low around her head. Oh, baby at once, she cried angrily, stamping her foot and jerking at the necklace. But the string broke, and the beads went rolling away in the darkness in every direction and were last. All but one, which she clashed in her hand. Then Ogle gaped at the castle gate. Wept outside in the night in the darkness, in her peasant's garb of toe. But after a while, through her sobbing, stole the answering sob of the nightwind. Hush, it seemed to say, never a heart can come to harm. If the lips but speak the old dames charm. The voice of the night winds sounded so much like the voice of the old flacks been at Ogle was startled and looked around wonderingly. Then suddenly she seemed to see the thashed cottage in the bent form of the lonely old woman at the wheel. All the years in which the good-dayme had befriended her, seemed to rise up in a row, and out of each one called a thousand kindnesses as with one voice. How can't thou forget us, Ogle? We were done for love sweet sake, and that alone. Then was Ogle sorry and ashamed that she had been so proud and forgetful, and she wept again. The tears seemed to clear her vision, for now she saw plainly, that through no power of her own, could she rest strange favours from fortune. Only the power of the old charm could make them hers. She remembered it then, and holding fast the one beat in her hand, she repeated humbly. For love sweet sake in my hour of need, blossom in deck me, little seed. Low is the word left her lips, the moon shone out from behind the clouds above the dark forest. There was a fragrance of lilies all about, and a gossamagound floated around her, white her than the whiteness of the fairest lily. It was fine like the finest lace the frost elves weave, and softer than the softesterm in of the snow, on her long golden hair, gleamed a coronet of pearls. So beautiful, so dazzling was she she entered the castle door, that the prince came down to meet her, and kneeling, kissed her hand and claimed her as his bride. Then came the bishop in his mighter, and led her to the throne, and before them all, the flag spin as maiden was married to the prince, and made the princess Olga. Then until the seven days and seven nights were done, the revels lasted in the castle, and in the merry-minute the old flag spinner was again forgotten. Her kindness from the past, her loneliness in the present, had no part in the thoughts of the princess Olga. All night the old oak, tapping on the thach, cold down. Thought forgotten, Thought forgotten. But the beads that had rolled away in the darkness, buried themselves in the earth and took root, and sprang up as the old woman knew they would do. There at the castle gate they bloomed, a strange strange flower, from every stem hung a row of little bleeding hearts. One day the princess Olga, seeing them from her window, went down to them in wonderman. What do you hear? She cried, for in her forest life she'd learned all speech of bird in beast and plant. We bloom for love sweet sake, they answered. We have sprung from the old flag spinners gift, the necklace that it's break and scatter, from her heart's best blood she gave it, and her heart still pleads to think she is forgotten. Then they began to tell the story of the old-daym sacrifices, all the 70 times seven that she had made for the sake of the maiden, and all gregary of dischievous and that she could have been so ungrateful. Then she brought the prince to hear the story of the strange strange flowers, and when he had heard, together they went to the lowly cottage, and fetched the old flag spinner to the castle. They had to live out all her days in ease and contentment. See now, she whispered to the oak at parting, but steadily he held his ground, persisting. Now what's to Ben forgotten, save for that miracle of bloom, and still the flower they call bleeding heart glooms on by cottage walls and castle gardens, to awaken all the world to great full memories, and ever it doff bring to mind the lonely hearts that bleed because they are forgotten, and all they sacrificed for love's sweet sake to give us happiness.

"The ""Falcon"" on the Baltic",Edward Frederick Knight,300782,7.0,"November 9, 2020",[],0," Librevox.org. The Falcon on the Baltic by EF-Night. Chapter 1 I get a new boat. In the summer of 86, I was without my favourite toy, a yacht, and had no intention of purchasing a vessel. I just returned from a winter cruise about a Spanish mane and through the West Indies, and any voyage more extensive than a boating expedition on the Albert Tames was quite out of my mind. When I, by chance, came across a boat lying at Hamasmith of all unlikely places, which appeared to me to be singularly adapted for the realization of one of my earliest yachting dreams. For many years, I had talked of visiting the Baltic in a small yacht, and I had often taken up the charts and pilot books of that tideless sea, and planned pleasant cruisers among the deep winding fjords, and narrow sounds of the Danish islands, and now I saw before me the very boat for the purpose. The small of the yacht, the better the sport, is a maxim which, in my opinion, holds good in most waters, but especially so when a cruise on the Baltic is in question. For on all the shores of that sea, even where the map indicates long straight stretches of iron bound coast, there are innumerable small artificial havens, which have been constructed by the hearing of fishermen, for the accommodation of their shallow craft. And again, on many of the islands, the only harbours are those of hoarding shelter to the ferry boats which plied to the main land. Harbours, as a rule, have no more than three feet of water. Therefore, small yachts only can visit these out of the way spots. A cruise among the islands affords some of the fascination of a voyage of discovery. At many of them, sea-going vessels never call. And as all the English yachts that into the Baltic are of considerable tonnage, the English yachtsmen knows but little of the charms of the best cruising ground in Europe. The Baltic is a treacherous sea, settled where there can never be dependent on. Gale spring up, ferry unexpectedly, and a nasty sea rises quickly on its shallow waters. But a little yacht, following the coast, has nearly always some snug harbour to run for, should bed where there come on. Whereas a larger craft with deeper draft must need stand out to sea and make the best of it she can. The small yacht is certainly the one for the Baltic, but to get her there is a somewhat difficult task. To arrive at the mouth of the river Eider, when the Baltic can be reached by canal, involves a voyage across the north sea and a lengthy cruise along the coast of Holland and Germany. Unless the yachtsmen has exceptional luck with his weather, this journey is likely to cause him a considerable amount of anxiety. For the east coast of the north sea, its dangerous shores, tumbling seas and lack of harbours to run for, is certainly the last the skipper of a small yacht would select for a pleasure cruise. But once let him reach the mouth of the Eider, and he will be more than compensated for his preliminary difficulties and hardships. The yacht at Hamasmith possess two qualities not usually found together, she was a very light draft, and yet she was an excellent seaboat. She drew something under three feet, and so could enter the shallowest Danish boat harbor, with her, if I saw a port before me I could run in boldly, not needing a pilot, and without troubling my head about the depths of water. For where any other boat had gone before, mine was able to follow it. She also looked like a craft that would put up with a great deal of heavy weather, and could be trusted to carry one safely across the north sea. I saw that she was, in short, the very vessel I required, so I came to terms with her owner, and some found that I had no reason to be disappointed with my bargain. The Falcon, for so I named her after my former vessel, was an old piano lifeboat, and her doubtless made many of which to endure and back on a steamer's deck. As is the way with lifeboats, her bow and stern were alike, and she had far more sheer than he's ever given to a yacht. She had been built in the strongest manner by the well-known lifeboat builder, white of cows. She was double-skinned, both skins being of the best teak, the outer of horizontal, the inner of diagonal planking. The gentleman from whom I bought her had converted her into a yor, or to be more correct, a catch, for her misnmast was well-in-bored, so that her mancil was smaller, and her misnmast, than used the case with yours. An advantage as far as handing out these concerned. The water tide compartments had been taken out of her. A false keel had been farstened on, and she had been decked all over with the exception of a small well. There was no appliance for covering over this well in bed, whether, but I have never seen a pint of water tumble into it, so buoyant and admirable a seabot did the little vessel proved to be. The falcon is jury-reaked, too much so indeed, her spars and sails being rather too small. Her main masts glowers on a tap and echo, a system which I do not like for seawork, but which proved useful on an orphaned roads. She is 29 feet long and of three tons register. When I bought her, the season was so far advanced, that I had to postpone my Baltic expedition until the following summer, but I made a pleasant trial cruising her down our east coast, and on the broads and rivers of Norfolk. I succeeded in exploring all the potions of those inland waters which are practicable to a yacht of three feet draft, but as might be expected from so long and shallow a boat, she was slow in stays and ill adapted for the narrow streams beloved of the East Angle and Yachtsmann. This crewed so rather falcon was brought back to Hamasmith, and during the winter, all was got ready for her Baltic voyage. So strong our life boats went built on this diagonal system, that it is considered unnecessary to timber them. But when one of them is converted into a yacht, and if you seem tended to subject her to the great strain of rigging, it becomes advisable to place some timbers into her, especially under the channel plates. So I had seven stout timbers put in on either side, and among other improvements, a strong oak rubbing piece was carried around her, a new and larger rudder fitted on, and a stout rail placed on her bow-warks. After all this, built as she was of imperishable wood and copper-fastened, she seemed to savor little vessel as it sailors hard could desire. Her cabin was a spacious one for a boat of her tonnage. There wasn't much headroom in it, but I don't hold it some do, that to be able to stand up in one's cabin is an essential honour small yacht. If one wishes to assume an erect position, one can always go on deck. The shingle ballast, which she contained when I purchased her, was taken out and somewhat more than a ton of iron substituted. Many told me that this was far from sufficient, but a shallow boat should always be kept light. With more ballast, she was certainly turned windward better in smooth water, but it is of far greater importance to keep her lively and safe in a heavy sea. It is rare indeed that a yacht is fitted out at hammersmith for a foreign cruise, and it is certainly not one of the best places in England for these purpose. But somehow a yacht is not without much wrath on the part of all concerned, and not without much of the work having to be pulled pieces as utterly bad and done over again. Everything was satisfactorily completed at last. And as the Falcon lay off the dove's in, she looked far more smart and ready for business than she had ever done in her previous existence. When I bought her, her sides were tired, and active atrocious faddleism, for her skin was of the cleanest and most beautifully grained teak. So now all the tyre was burnt off, she was scraped and her natural lovely nose revealed. When she had been sandpapered and banished, she looked a very different sort of craft from a vault. No picture dealer who discovers some rare old master under a smoky door, ever effected so marvelous a transformation as did we, with this once black heavy-looking old top. In the second week in May, the finishing touches would give into the yacht, and the stores were brought on board. A goodly supply of 10-metes and pickles was stowed in the lockers. For the benefit of inexperienced yachtsmen, I may state that the above, together with tea, sugar and coffee, are the only provisions of which it is advisable to carry a large quantity from England. Everything else is much cheaper abroad. We did all our cooking with a large spirit stove which answered admirably. Mr George Wilson of Glasshouse Street supplies similar stoves in several sizes. I have used petroleum on small yachts, but I shall never do so again. The spirit stove is far cleaner and better in every respect. We did a good deal of cooking each day with this kitchener, and yet we consumed only a shillings worth of spirit per week. I took a large supply of methylated spirit with me from England. As an old traveler I should have known better for burning spirit is nearly twice as dear in England as in the countries I visited, and it is easy to procure it, even in small farm towns. I did not forget to lay up a stock of old rum. Trouette is that spirits for internal application are also cheaper abroad. But then one does not at once acquire the taste for Scandinavian aqua vete and the firewater of Holland in Germany. Of tobacco I took that sufficient to last me across the German ocean. Not being one of those who cannot smoke Dutch tobacco, because it costs little more apparent than the English does and ounce. A considerable number of charts were necessary for my projected cruise. These I procured in London. A great mistake on my part. Danish and Swedish charts for the Baltic are better than those of our English Admiralty, which last do not indicate a snug little fishing harpers I've mentioned above. One of the best known map and chart sellers in London sold me for 25 shillings, what he called the only reliable maps of the Dutch canals. They proved to be quite useless. But while walking through the higher glateron I saw some really admirable maps of the low countries in a shop window, which I purchased for three shillings. The vessel was of course provided with riding lights, side lights and anoride, and all the manifold articles necessary for a small yacht bound fun. I brought with me my quant, a relic of the North at Browards, and very useful to it often proved to be. A rifle in shotgun weren't forgotten, but they were never put to use. My sextant was also on board, with which I took the latitude twice only during the cruise, and on those occasions more for amusement than from necessity. How dinghy was a live and feet long, we had no room for it on deck so we always told it as soon. It followed us thus all the way to Copenhagen, and no accident be felled. This dinghy had a six inch false keel and sailed extremely well under her balance lug. She was found very useful for ascending fjords and shallow rivers, inaccessible to the yacht. A dinghy will tow in a far less erratic manner before a following sea, if she's provided with a false keel. We were in the habit of putting a half-hundred-way to vire in the interstune, to steady her when the weather was rough. With the result that she followed us as quietly as possible, not cheering wildly about and rushing furiously down upon us as this the want to dinghy's under such circumstances. So much for the yacht and now for the crew. Until almost the last moment I had no idea as to who was to be my companion. My wish had been to take friends with me and dispense with professional sailors, but though I found no lack of friends who would have liked to join me, none could spare the time for so long a voyage, especially at this early period of the summer. I had no intention of shipping a yacht sailor for it's difficult to find among that somewhat spoiled class the right man for a foreign cruise in a small yacht. I knew of one John Wright, a young fellow who had been with me before and who was the very man for the purpose, but the last I had heard of him was that he had sailed out of London before the mast on a vessel bound for me in the air as Australia or some other distant portion of the globe and it was impossible to say when he might return. So the Falcon lay off the dove's end, their sail's bent ready for sea and all respects, saved that she had a captain only in no crew. When, one afternoon, met me when I was a ranging things in the cabin, a messenger arrived to say that a young man which to speak with me, the young man proved to be none other than John Wright himself. He had landed in the docks that morning having arrived from Alexandria in the very nick of time to sail with me. John Wright has luckily had nothing to do with cows and yachts. His life is passed before the mast in foreign-going steamers and sailing vessels and for his foreign-arft training, he's indebted to mistly barges and small coasting steamers on the North Sea, an excellent school. A yachting cruise of this sort was a novelty to him and I believe he enjoyed it as much as I did myself, which is saying a good deal. Provided with the best boat and best crew for my purpose, I anticipated a successful and pleasant holiday and I was not disappointed. As is usually the case when one wishes to get away, I found that business was likely to detain me in England until the end of the month. But I can drive to take the Falcon to the mouth of the Timts for a trial trip so that if anything was wrong with the vessel, we might discover and repair it at once. On May the 13th, Wright and myself were on board shortly after daybreak, getting already for the journey through London. We un-stipped the muslim, lowered the main mast on deck, took the boat's bread in and anchoring in the stream, waited for the beginning of the air. In the tugs with their strings of barges or stern, might be expected to pass us on their way from Brentford to Woolwich. At about 7 o'clock, we recognised the puffing Billy Sunbeen, coming around the corner opposite Chisick, with three barges in towed. I hailed the skipper, came to terms with him, and he turned round to pick me up. We quickly got our anchor up, hove the tug the end of our grass road, and was soon towing at a rattling pace downstream, under London's 20 breaches. Then breakfast was got underway and we were quite ready for our hot coffee, for a strong and keen northeast wind was blowing. It felt him looked like December, and the weather was certainly as unsuitable as possible for small yacht sailing. The day was still young when we reached Woolwich. Here, the tugs lift us, and we let go our anchor off north Woolwich Gardens close to the steamboat pier in the company of several scooters and barges. For this is a favourite anchorage for small coasters. We now raised our masks set up the rigging, and made the Falcon look once more like a yacht. As we didn't anticipate having to lower the masks again during the cruise, we took the precaution of frapping our forest outfall, and also putting on a preventive fall. A very necessary precaution with a tabernacle, the emission of which has caused many accidents. When we'd completed our work, we found that the remained but on our ove, then both tired and wind would be against us. So as it was clearly not worth our while to sail that day, it was decided to remain where we were until the marrow. North Woolwich is a dismal and unlawfully spot. A theory steamer runs every few minutes to south Woolwich, but as this isn't even still lacing by a plane place, I did not venture to cross the river. A travelling circus proprietor had pitched his tent near the shore at north Woolwich. So in the evening I took a topony stall and sat through the performance. It blew very hard from the north east, the rickety tent swayed in an alarming manner as if about to fall and bury us at any moment. The wind too found its way with the inn and the climate became so burying. Some of the performers were really clever, but it was not a very cheerful spectacle. The fair are teeth with blue noses, shibard in their thin tides. And the clown's teeth chatted so with cold that he could scarcely bring out his time on his chests. It would have been still more chillers where it not for one comfortable rule of the establishment, the audience and members of the company also were not performing were permitted to smoke. We all availed ourselves of the permission, and of course under the enchantment of tobacco things seemed better at once. To my surprise, I recognised among the truth a clever acrobat whom I had last seen in cubant garden circus. This man, it seems, is so incurable of a heme in his tastes that though he can always command a salary which many at distinguished lawyer would envy. He loves to pass a large portion of the year in vagabondising about the country, with ambiguity as and record travelling companies of this description, living from hand to mouth and often retiring suppolus to bed after a hard night's work. And though he thus volunteered in due as so many provisions, he informed me that he could not understand any sane person undertaking such a boy at just the one I meditated in a small boat. This critic could see no eccentricity in his own uncomfortable way of taking his pleasure. This story has a moral which I submit to certain of my friends, the while devoted to as arduous and not so healthy hobbies as my own, and who yet went contemptuously at the motive my eye quite heedless of their own being, but this sounds confused and as if I was trying to pung end of chapter read by Jane Bennett.",Travel & Geography,English,08:02:08,LibriVox Volunteers,"['Dutch', 'Danish', 'muslim', 'Scandinavian', 'German', 'Swedish', 'Spanish', 'Baltic']","['Gale', 'Wright', 'John Wright', 'Hamasmith', 'George Wilson', 'Alexandria', 'Billy Sunbeen', 'Woolwich', 'Eider', 'Jane Bennett']","['Holland', 'Australia', 'the West Indies', 'London', 'Norfolk', 'Germany', 'North Woolwich', 'Yachtsmann', 'England', 'Brentford', 'Woolwich']","['the east coast', 'the East Angle', 'the north sea', 'Baltic', 'the North Sea', 'Europe']",2,2,3,0,7,2,0
The 'Mind the Paint' Girl,Louis Tracy,306213,4.0,"July 2, 2020",[],0,"isit liprifox.org. Recording by A to N Stevens. The mind of the paint girl by Lewis Tracey Chapter 1. A May Morning. The music of the band came nearer. The cold streams were marching from Chelsea to relieve the grenadiers. Strollers in the park, loungers in Pal-Mal and St James' street seemed to quicken visibly under the lute and rhythm of the lively air. A crowd, mostly drawn from the provinces and overseas, had gathered already on the pavement, either beneath the wall of Marbra House or on the south of Pal-A Square. And even the case hardened coccaners who happened to be passing hurried to watch the daily pageant of guard mounting. The oncoming band acted on them as a magnet acts on steel filings. As it approached, each human atom became active. Two men, neither of whom had seen the other, turned out to Pal-Mal about the same moment, but on opposite sides of Marbra gate. The elder of the pair unmistakably the type of retired soldier, which ranges from Colonel to Field-Marshall had just quit it a club in St James' street. If hair and mustache were white, his figure was trim and erect, and at the martial strains of the band, his shoulders unconsciously squared themselves, and his face lost an expression of settled melancholy, singularly out of keeping with spruce guitar and military bearing. The younger man, tall and strongly built, was a captain in a line battalion, but walked with the air and swing of a cavalry man. He came from Pal-Mal and a casual glance at the century in front of Marbra House in order to learn from the colour of the Caucas, and the arrangement buttons on the skull at Tionic, what regiment had been on duty during the previous 24 hours, cost him an opportunity of recognizing an old friend. London gives, or withholds, such haphazard encounters, with calisind difference. In ordinary conditions, these two might not have met a second time within the year, but now the band, with bloodstaring clash of brass and symbols, had wheeled out of the park into the wall-pant road, and alert policemen were shepherding the onlookers into compact masses. Again, the band wheeled, some staccato orders made themselves heard above the din of drums and instruments. The old guards, rifles clatter to the present. The new guard became two solid lines of black and red, faced to the left, and moved in toward the square. Then the crowd broke, eager to gain a few yards close of you of the spectacle, and this reshuffling of its units brought the two army men side by side. Hello Niko! Hello Colonel! Their hands met with a ready-class befriendship. My wife tells me you are in town, she saw you last night in the stalls at the Pandora, so we were expecting you to call, said the veteran. Yes, of course, this afternoon, without fail, said Niko Jays, Niko to his intimates. But Captain Nicholas Jays of the North Devons to the wide world. The C.O. gave me ten days district-leave, and I reached town from the carer yesterday, just in time to dress and eat before going to the theatre. Colonel, the honorable Arthur stood off, for all that he was, a society man, to the tips of his well-manic-udfingers, had an incurable trick of allowing his face to betray his thoughts. A slight frown of bewilderment now chased away the smile, which had welcomed Jays. Today is in May, exclaimed. I had a notion you were keen on soldiering Niko. So I am so, nobody more so, yet even Napoleon kicked when he was sent from Paris to O'azel, and the carer is a deuce of a whole after older shot. Stead off, snorted, disapproval. But you were a version first, my boy, and a jolly long first before the Pandora Theatre and its frills, he said. You'll hardly believe it, knowing me as you do, but time was, when I would have jumped down my junior captain's throat, if he had asked for ten days leave, in the very height of the drill season. Sorry, Niko. For the tired old eyes, had detected a flush of embarrassment beneath the tan of his heurus cheeks. That's a beastly in hospital remark, and you know I don't mean it in that sense. Just for a moment, I put myself in low-coper antists. Perhaps Satan, Rebeconcine would be a better similarly, because your father died in harness, whereas I, well, here I am, tiptoeing among the mob to gaze at my enrichment, dash it all, it's a fine morning. Let's talk about something else. Jay's had his own reasons for falling in readily with a suggested change of topic. Most of the men here on you to me, he said, who is the grenadier subaltern with the colours? Oh, that's farmcome, nice boy, son of the Earl of Godloming. Why can't farm come? Yes, lucky chap, soldering as made easy for him, so it was me, yet I had a chuck the service soon after I got command of the battalion. Then Jay's could have bitten his tongue viciously, if that could have withdrawn the unhappy remark. For it was an open secret that Stidoth had been refused and extension, sure preliminary to a district, at a major general ship, because he had married Dolly Enzo, a minor star of the Pandora galaxy. The honourable Mrs. Arthur Stidoth might have averted the deadly effect of the maize alias, had she been sufficiently plastic to adapt herself to the ways and use edges of society, but she was a good deal more of a Pandora girl after marriage than before. She regarded her rise in the social scale as justifying a loudness of manner, which the stage manager had sternly repressed on the board of the theatre, and as the direct outcome her husband was shelved professionally. Not that Mrs. Stidoth cared a jot. Married to the brother of an Earl, and fairly well provided with money, so long as she remained within the four walls of the law, she could not be ousted wholly from the sacred enclosures of the upper ten thousand. Fully content she tripped joyously through life, and the ex-kernal of the guards gained hers, Dolly Enzo's husband, a celebrity denied to his military career. In his confusion, the younger man could find nothing to say. As for Stidoth, he was gazing hungrily at the little group of officers who had now broken up into pairs and were strolling to and fro, while sergeants and corporals marched reliefs to the various posts in the precincts of the palaces. The band had become an orchestra, and the conductor, after submitting a program to the senior captain, raised his baton. When Jay's heard the opening bars of a selection, his face brightened. By joe of Kernal, he said, these fellows are bang up to date, they are playing the Duchess of Brickston, and it was only produced a week ago. The older man came back from his stage room, yes, he said. I was there. Mrs Stidoth is an inveterate first, neither. Rather a pretty opera, but while I don't pose at an expert in such things, it struck me as lacking the one song or the outstanding bit of acting, which usually splies the clue to a musical comedy. Oh, I thought it was capital. Protested James. His companion laughed, Mother, so he said. He said, you are young enough to watch the twirling feet of the pretty girls, rather than pay heed to such trifles as plot and melody. The rotten thing about the stage, commented Jay's earnestly, is the way genuine talent, his burped. I can't say how it is with the men, but where the girls are concerned, an actress depends far more on having a pull with a manager, or with some city magnate who is financing the show, that on real ability in her work. I have heard that said a great many times, Niko. Yet, what little experience I have goes to prove the exact contrary, the managerial or financial pull, we will speak of, will never succeed in filling the house, grit and genius tell on the stage exactly as they come on, the prizes in every other profession. Why, I could give you a list of names that would surprise you. I did every instance, so women has forced herself to the front by straining his effort, backed up, of course, by a good voice and good looks. Look at, is he a governor? Broken a small man, with ginger hair and a bristling moustache, who had been striving vainly to catch the strains of the new opera. If you wouldn't mind, then Colonel stood off last quite cheerfully. I apologise, my friend, he said. Doing anything, Niko, count on my club, will have a jaw and an early lunch. Sorry, I have an appointment for the west. Jay is consulted his watch. I must take a cab, he added. I had plenty of time to stroll, though, when we had started, but I did not realise how the minutes were slipping along. And the years, don't forget the years, see you at T. Yes, sir. Meanwhile, my best wishes to miss his stood off. They parted. Carrots nunched his neighbour. Bloy me, he go gold. Or he didn't catch his name the first time, an honorable ears. Dolly answers us, Ben. Fancy me chip in the old cock like that. But he ain't so dead stuck on the stage, is he charley? No, he's a damn psyched too much about it. So, surely, who was by way of being a philosopher. Jay's was using no polite fiction when he spoke of taking a cab. He sees the first that presented itself a handsome as it happened. The taxi meter being just at the beginning of its triumphant descent on London and told the driver to rush him to hide park corner. The hands of the clock over the lodge keepers house stood exactly at eleven, as he sprang to the pavement and he hurried across the row with an air of urgency, fully explained by the cheerful impatience, with which he was greeted by a pretty girl awaiting him near the statue of Achilles. Cult you tripping at last, you are late, Nikko, she cried. Only one minute, he protested, is somewhat heavy face brightening with your sight of her. I met Colonel Stidoff and I couldn't in decency hurry away, especially as he was lecturing me. What about, about me? No, Lily, thank God, he has never even heard your name. But, Nikko, why so serious? Why should you offer up thanks because I am a misnobody of nowhere whom no one ever even heard of, as you say? Evidently the two were bent on some more definite object than a mere stroll in the park, for they had turned in the direction of Stan hope gate, without any discussion as to the root they should follow. The girl, tall, slim and quietly tired, moved with an easy, supple elegance. She was young, not yet twenty, and youth is naturally graceful, but the expert eye would determine at a glance that she was a dancer, and in all probability and uncommonly good one. A blue surge costume, neat gloves and boots, at a hat by no means flamboyant in style or size, showed that Miss Lily Paradelle, so only a curry-fay in the Pandora theatre did not share the average taste of her class for bizarre garments. Despite her youth, she had graduated in the hard academy of pantomime and musical, and her companions' fervour, with regard to her professional insignificance, was hardly justified, since it was no small achievement that she should have won her way already through the most closely guarded stage door in London. The rounded brows, over the big earnest eyes, she had raised to her escort's face, showed that she was surprised, perhaps a trifle resentful of his tone, and a slight wave of colour heightened and glorified her somewhat pale cheeks. Always pretty, Lily Paradelle had suddenly become beautiful, and had kept in jays been more finely observant. He might have made the delightful discovery that a bright intelligence was a greatest charm, but he could only feel that he had somehow struck a false note, and he hastened to correct the blunder. I didn't mean that, Lily, and you're merely teasing me by pretending that you think otherwise, he said. In fact, poor old stiddles remarks ran in a precisely contrary sense. I was grumbling about the difficulty, a really smart girl encounters in making a start, in raising herself above the common level that is, but he stuck out that the stage does really offer, la carrière au vert au telon. How are you getting on with your French? Well, enough to understand that, she said gleefully, and your friend is right, Niko. Not that he, let me see, didn't he marry Dolly-Encer? Yes! Why do you say yes in that way? Because the honourable Arthur used to be such a smart chap in my time at Sanhurst, and now he's a back number. He should have done more with his life than simply barrior woman who happened to be a bit of a celebrity, I didn't he make a career for himself. Appley Jay's had tacked enough to check the imminent explanation. He rather lost touch with soldering, I've been see, he said. But the girls' sharp ears had caught the pause, the careful weighing of the reply before it was uttered. Was it because he married an actress? She demanded quickly. Good gracious, no, there's no barter social progress nowadays. Some mischief was thought danced in the girls' eyes, which continued to search her friends son-bern face inquisitively. Lots of our hike, because Mary Lords, which is a cut above her non-reble, I suppose. She seemed to be musing aloud, but there was no uncertainty in the succeeding question, which was very much to the point. Nico, what would you say if I made a hit? And all the giddy young gathers about town began chasing me? May I smoke? Such as? Yes, but answer me. I would be pleased, of course, and frontically jealous, equally of course. Now, let's chuck problems and admire the flowers. We cross here, the beds begin at the other side of Stan Hope gate. Nico, I'm serious, as to the hit, at any rate? I have been given my chance. What do you mean? Has that silly little ass, Lion or Dropa been filling her head with nonsense? The star-wet captain's voice had grown harsh. He knew that this charming girl was flirting with him innocently, leading him on, and he hated himself for the miserable, truckling to convention, which held him back from the supreme step of asking her to be his wife. Please don't call Uncle Low, rude names, said Lily. Though the tremendous news, which she could no longer retain, choked down the resentment she would certainly have expressed at any other time, the ultimate reference to Ropa was quite unwarranted since he approved to be a real friend to herself and her mother. I'm thoroughly in earnest. Marie Kooling, our business manager, you know, was growling the other night about the lack of go in the Duchess of Brickston, and Vincent Bland, the composer, he really is a duck, or the cows love him. Remember that I sang a little ballad rather well one night in the Canterbury, and what do you think? He has written me a song full stage with chorus. I'm rehearsing it today for the first time, and I really do believe it will catch on. The concluding words rose in a crescendo of excitement, and, for once, she was blinded the scale on her cabanian's face. Matters had come to that pitch. He was furiously resentful of any influence that might lift Lily Paradelle into prominence, less his own dog in the manger policy should be endangered, but he had the sense and good breeding to conceal his feelings for the hour. By Joe, I congratulate you, little. He managed to stammer. Is it a decent sort of song? What's the air like? Oh, it goes with a splendid swing, and it has such jolly catch word, I'm supposed to be the mind the paint girl. This is the chorus of the first verse. Mind the paint, mind the paint, no matter whether maples bills are settled or they ain't. Once you smear it, or you scratch it, it's impossible to match it, so take care please off the paint off the paint. Isn't it great? Can't you hear it's on the parallel organs? If only I work it up as I think I can, it will go through town like the flue. Jay's pulled her out of the way of a noiseless electric brawler. In her enthusiasm, Lily had forgotten her surroundings, though she was only humming a refrain, her artist's eyes were gazing at a dim and crowded house beyond the footlights. She heard the subdued strains of the orchestra. She watched the conductors uplifted baton. This was her opportunity, and she must seize it with both hands now. The motor stole past with silent speed. It had creptoonier and might have knocked her down, but for Jay's is prompt help. Yet, Lily Paradelle was still seeing visions, and being a vivacious young lady she laughed at the careless chauffeur. Mind the paint, she cried, and a bewiscid face, ground by a silk hat, was framed for an instant in the Brawms window. Oh dear, she sighed, now I've gone and done it. That was Colton's mouth, whatever will he think of me. To her, the manager of the Pandora Theatre was a tremendous dirty, thrown high on some peak of the Thespian Olympus. In reality, he was a shrewd and cautious judge of public taste in musical comedy, and he was thinking that if the girl would only throw as much animation into the new song on stages, she had displayed in the park, the Duchess of Brixton was safe for a hundred nights at least. See what it is to have a steady-going chap like me handy, such as, if I hadn't been just in the right place, you would have been run over. Nor would I have been singing and generally playing the guitty goat in Hyde Park, still, I'm awfully obliged to you, Nick O'Deer. You know you come first all the time, no matter what the future may have in store. She flashed a look at him, and such a wealth of tender kindliness poured from a deep blue eyes that his brain reeled. He could not guess, Lily herself could not have told him that friendship rather than love, inspired that thrilling glance. Youth, a bounding vitality, the first glimpse of back-ending ambition, such was the formula of the magic elixir, coursing through her veins on that bright May morning. It rendered her more than ever desirable. Given her favour, no man could resist her. A Nicholas J. is was a man, though neither bright Nor swift at nature. Least of all did he understand women, or he would have known that Lily Paradale was simply brimming over with high spirits in good nature. When she loved, she would die rather than offer her love. Yet it was a moment fraught with possibilities. A briefed word, a caressing pressure of the girl's arm, and the divine spark might have reached the hidden store of passion in Lily's heart. J. is glove-tans were clenched fiercely. He was on the verge of what he regarded as a social precipice, when an aristocratic Dame, leading a pecanese dog met the two as they reached the path and gave him a gracious nod of recognition. Who was that? said Lily in an undertone, Lady Vallataut, Mutted J. Friend of yours? Yes, friend of my mother's to be exact. She didn't forget to look me up and down, you know heaps of people like her, I suppose, or do you to be walking with me here, Niko? Don't talk nonsense. Why shouldn't I walk with you here or anywhere else? You might have said it was an honour conferred by me, dear boy, but you didn't, and you're right, I'm not in your set. That word's set is the most detestable word in the English language. There are others and we wouldn't use them if they had no meaning, but we're not going to quarrel, Niko, because Lady Watts' name raised her eyebrows. Here are the flowers, how perfectly beautiful. Now I can see what you meant when you said last evening that we Londoners would call the gods to witness that there was nothing in the world to equal them if we saw such a display in Paris, yet we passed them by our noticed in dear old foggy London, but who christened them such awful names? Ah, here is something in my line. Don't touch, keep off the grass. Don't you see? It's another way of telling you to mind the paint. You'll be in town next Monday? Yes, how chilly! I shall feel more at home if I see you in the stalls grinning like a cheshire cat and yelling for an encore. Some girls packed the theatre on the first night of a new song just to make it go, but I shant, I couldn't. If I wanted to ever so, there's only you and Lao Roper and Bertie Fulcason if he hasn't died too well. Poo! Bertie Fulcason, young idiot! Captain Nicholas Jays was himself again and the North Devon's mess at the colour was spared a sensation, but Cupid perhaps stole away among the flowers and soaked until some other youthful pair aroused his interest or sought his sympathy.

Mr. Govard and Smith read by TJ Burns. In Spectre Morton read by Beth Thomas. The bottle read by Lian Yao. Mrs Hudson, the land lady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering woman. Not only was her first floor flat invaded, at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters. But her remarkable larger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life, which must have sorely tried her patients. He's incredible untidyness. His addiction to music has trained hours. His occasional revolver practice within doors. His weird and often melodious scientific experiments. And the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him, made him the very worst tenant in London. On the other hand, his payments were princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his room during the years that I was with him. The Lian ladies stood in the deepest awe and respect of him, and never dared to interfere with him. However, outrageous his proceedings might seem. She was fond of him too for header and remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a surest opponent. Knowing how genuine was her regard for him. I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my room in the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to his my poor friend who was reduced. He's dying, Dr. Watson. Said she. For three days he has been sinking, and I doubt if he will last a day. He would not let me get a doctor. This morning, when I saw his bones sticking out of his face, and his great bright eyes looking had me, I could stand no more of it. With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very hour, said I. That it be Watson, then, said he. I wouldn't waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive. I was horrified for I had had nothing of his illness. I need not say that I rushed to my coat in my hat. As we drove back I asked the details. There was little I can tell you, sir, he has been working at a case down at Rutherhire, in an early near-deriver, and he has brought this illness back with him. He took to his bed and went to the afternoon and has never moved sins. For these three days, night or food nor drink has passed his lips. Good God, why did you not call in a doctor? He wouldn't have it, sir. He know how masterful he is. I didn't dare to disobey him, but he is not long for this world, as you will see for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him. He was indeed a deplorable spectacle. In the dim light to a foggy November day, the sickering was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt, wasted face, staring at me from the bed, which sent the children my heart. His eyes had the brightness of fever. There was a hectic flush upon either cheek, and dark crusts clung to his lips. The thin hands upon the couple at twitched incessantly, his voice was cranking and spasmud it. He lay listlessly as I entered the room, but the sight of me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes. Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days, said he, in a feeble voice, but with something of his old kindness, a misold kindness of manner. My dear fellow, I tried, approaching him. Stand back, stand right back, said he, with a sharp imperialistness, which I had associated only with moments who crisis. If you approached me Watson, I shall order you out of the house. But why? Because it is my desire, because that's not enough. Yes, Mrs Huggton was right. He was more masterful than ever. It was pitiful, however, to see his exhaustion. I only wish to help, I explained. Exactly. You will help best by doing what you are told. Certainly, Holmes. He relaxed the austerity of his manner. You are not angry. He asked, gasping for breath. Poor devil. How could I be angry when I stalk him lying in such a plight before me? It's for your own sake Watson. He croaked. From my sake? I know what is the matter with me. It is a coolly disease from Sumatra, a thing that the Dutch know more about than we. Though they have made little of it up to date. One thing only is certain. It is infallibly deadly, and it is horribly contagious. He spoke now with a feeble hennake. On hand, twitching and jerking as he motioned me away. Contagious by touch Watson. That's it, by touch. Keep your distance and all is well. Good heavens, Holmes. Do you suppose that such a consideration weighs with me of an instant? It would not affect me in the case of a stranger. Do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to sow older friend? Again, I advanced, but he repulsed me with a look of her as anger. If you will stand there, I will talk. If you do not, you must leave the room. I have so deep respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes that I have always deferred to his wishes, even when I at least understood them. But now, all my professional instincts were arose. Let him be my master elsewhere. I at least was his in a sick room. Holmes, say, I, you are not yourself. A sick man is but a child, and so I will treat you, whether you like it or not, I will examine your symptoms and treat you for them. He looked at me with venomous eyes. If I am to have a doctor, whether I will or not, let me at least have someone in whom I have confidence. Said he, then you have none in me, in your friendship, certainly. But facts are facts, Watson, and after all, you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience and mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to say these things, but you leave me no choice. I was bitterly heard. That's your remark is unworthy of you Holmes. It shows me very clearly the state of your own nerves. But if you have no confidence in me, I would not treat my services. Let me bring you to just for me, or penmost isher, or any of the best men in London. But someone you must have, and that is final. If you think that I am going to stand here and see you die with either helping you myself, or bringing anyone else to help you, then you have mistaken your man. You mean, well, Watson, said the sick man with something to sort an adurene. Shall I demonstrate your own ignorance? What do you know, pray of tapinually fever? What do you know of the black, foremost, a corruption? I have never heard of either. There are many problems of disease, many strange pathological possibilities in the east, Watson. He paused after each sentence to collect his failing strength. I have learned so much during some recent researches, which have a medical criminal aspect. It was in the course of them that I contracted this complaint. You can do nothing. Possibly not. But I haven't to know that Dr. Aestry, the greatest living authority from tropical disease, is now in London. All remnants of his useless. I am going this instant to fetch him. I turn regularly to the door. Never have I had such a shock. In an instant, with a tiger spring, the dying man had intercepted me. I heard the sharp snap of a twisted key. The next moment he had started back to his bed. He exhausted and panting after his one tremendous outflame with energy. You won't take the key from me by force, Watson. I've got you my friend. Here you are, and here you will stay until I will otherwise. But I'll do you me. All this in little gas, with terrible struggles for breath between. You've only my own good at heart. Of course, I know that very well. You shall have your way, but give me time to get my strength. Not now, Watson. Not now. It's four o'clock at six you can go. This is insanity home. Only two hours, Watson. I promise you will go at six. Are you content to wait? I seem to have no choice. Now, in the world, Watson. Thank you. I need no help in arranging the clothes. You will please keep your distance. Now, Watson, there is one other condition that I would make. You'll seek help not from the man you mentioned, but from the one that I choose. My own means. The first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered this room Watson. You will find some books over there. I am somewhat exhausted. I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a non-conductor. At six Watson, we resume our conversation. But it was destined to be resumed, long before that hour, and in circumstances which gave me a short hardly second to that cause by his spring to the door. I had stood for some minutes looking at the silent figure in the bed. His thesis was almost covered by clothes, and he appeared to be asleep. Then, unable to settle down to reading, a walk slowly ran room, examining the pictures of celebrate criminals, with which every wall was adorned. Finally, in my aimless peramulation, I came to the mantle piece. A little of pipes to back up out his syringes, ten knives, revolver cartridges, and a bit debris was scussed over it. In the midst of these was a small black and white ivory box with a sliding lid. It was a neat little thing, and I had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely when it was a dreadful cry that he gave, a yellow which might have been hurt down the street. My skin went cold, and my hair bristle had had horrible scream. As I turned, I caught a glimpse of a convolved face and frantic eyes. I stood paralyzed with a little box in my hand. Put it down, down this instant Watson. This instant, I say, his head sank back upon the pillow, and he gave a deep sigh of relief, as I replaced the box upon the mantle piece. I, heaped to have my things touched Watson, you know that I hate it. You fidget me beyond endurance, you a doctor, you are enough to drive a patient into an asylum. Sit down, man, and let me have my rest. The incident left the most unpleasant impression upon my night. The violent and causal six-segment followed by this brutality of speech, so far removed me usual swabby. Showed me how deep was this organisation of his mind. Of all ribbons, that of an oval mind is the most deplorable, a satin silent injection until the stipulated time had passed. He seemed to have been watching the clock as well as I, for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the same figure's animation as before. Now Watson said he, have you any change in your pocket? Yes. Any silver? A good deal. How many half crowns I have, five? Ah, two few, two few. How very unfortunate Watson. However, such as they are, you can put them in your watch pocket, and all the rest of your money in your left trouser pocket. Thank you. It will balance you so much better like that. This was a rating insanity. He showed it, and again, they're astounded between a coffin and a dog. You will now light the gas Watson, but you will be very careful that not for one instant. Shall it be more than half on? I implore you to be careful Watson. Thank you. That is excellent. No, you need not draw the blind. Now you will have the kindness to place some letters and papers upon this table within my reach. Thank you. Now some of that litter from the mantelpiece. Excellent Watson. There is a sugar tongs there, kindly raised that small ivory box with its assistance. Place it here among the papers. Good. You can now go and fetch Mr. Culverton Smith of 13 Lower Burke Street. To tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened. For poor arms was so obviously hilarious that it seemed dangerous to leave him. However, he was as eager now to consult the person named as he had been obstinate in refusing. I never heard the name, said I. Possibly not, my good Watson. It may surprise you to know that the man upon earth, who is best versed in this disease, is not a medical man, but a plounter. Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of Sumatra, now visiting London, an outbreak of the disease upon his plantation, which was distant from medical aid. Caused him to study it himself with some far reaching consequences. He is a very methodical person, and I did not desire you to start before six, because I was well aware that you would not find him in his study. If you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique experience of this disease, the investigation of which has been his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me. A gave home disremarks as they could decadive hole, and I will not attempt to indicate how they were interrupted by goth things for breath, and those clutches of his hands, which indicated the pain from where he was suffering. His appearance had changed for the worst during the few hours that I had been with him. Those hectic spots were more pronounced. The eyes show more brightly out of darker hollows, and the cold sweat glimmer upon his brow. He still retained, however, the guilty gallantry of his speech. To the last gas, he would always be the laster. You will tell him exactly how you have left me. Said he, you will convey the very impression which is in your own mind, a dying man, a dying and delirious man. Indeed I cannot think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures seem. Oh, I am wondering. Strange how the brain controls the brain. What was I saying Watson? My directions for Mr. Colbert and Smith. I, yes, I remember. My life depends upon it, plead with him Watson. There is no good feeling between us. His nephew Watson. I had suspicion of foul play, and I allowed him to see it. The boy died horribly. He has a grudge against me. You will soften him Watson. Bec him, pray him, get him here. By any means, he can save me, only he. I will bring him in a cab if I have to carry him down to it. You will do nothing of the sort. You will persuade him to come, and then you will return in front of him. Bec any excuse, so as not to come with him, don't forget Watson. You won't fail me. You never did fail me. No doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the creatures. You and I Watson, we have done our part. Shall the world then be overrun by oysters? No, no horrible. You convey all that is in your mind. A left him full in the image of this magnificent intellect, babbling like a foolish child, he had handed me the key, and with a happy thought I took it with me, blessed he should lock himself in. Missed it's Hudson was waiting, trembling and weeping in the passage. Behind me as a person in the front, I heard homes whose high things of voice in some delirious child, below as I stood whistling for a cab, and man came on me through the fog. How was Mr. Holmes, sir? He asked, it wasn't all the questions, his back to Morton of Scotland, Yard, dressed in unethical tweets. He is very ill, I answered. He looked at me in a most singular fashion, had it not been too fiendish, I could have imagined that the gleam of the fan like showed exaltation in his face. I heard some rumour of it. Said he, the cab had driven up and I left him. Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses, lying in the vague borderland between nothing hill and Kensington, the particular one at which my cabin pulled up, had an air of smug and immuerepectability, in its old fashioned iron railings. It's massive folding door, and it's shining brass work, always in keeping with the solemn Butler who appeared friends in the pink radians of a tinted electrical light behind him. Yes, Mr. Colbert and Smith is in, Dr. Watson. Very good, sir. I will take up your card. My humble name and title did not appear to impress Mr. Colbert and Smith. Through the half-open door, I heard a high, petulant, penetrating voice. Who is this person? What does he want? Dear me, Stable's, how often have I said that I'm not to be disturbed in my hours of study? That came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the Butler. Well, I won't see him, Stable's. I can't have my work interrupted like this. I'm not at home. Say so. Tell him to come in the morning if you really must see me. The game's a gentle mother. Well, well, give him that message. He can come in the morning, or he can stay away. My work must not be hindered. I thought of home tossing upon his better sickness and counting the minutes perhaps, until I could bring help to him. It was not the time to stand upon ceremony. His life depended upon my promise. Before the apologetic Butler had delivered his message, I had pushed past him and was in the room. With a shrill cry of anger, a man rose from a reclining chair beside the fire. I saw a great yellow face, coarse grained and grizzy, with heavy double-gen, and two-cellent, many sing-ray eyes, which glare that me from under-tuffed it and sandy brows. A high-bought head had a small, velvoured smoking-gap-poised coquettishly upon one's eye of its pink curve. The skull was of enormous capacity, and yet as I looked down, I saw to my amazement that the figure of the man was small and frail, twisted in the shoulders and back, like one of herself had been from Ricky's in his childhood. What's this? He cried in a high-screening voice. What is the meaning of this intrusion? Didn't I send you word that I would see you tomorrow morning? I am sorry, Ted I, but the matter cannot be delayed, Mr. Fielock Holmes. The mention of my friend's name had an extraordinary effect upon the little man, the look of anger past inner and instant from his face. His features became tense and alert. Have you come from Holmes? He asked, I have just left him. What about Holmes? How is he? He is desperately ill, that is why I have come. The man motion me to a chair and turned to resume his own. As he did so, a quarter glimpse of his face in the mirror over the man called peace. I could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and abominable smile. Yet I could swearly myself that he must have been some of those of the contract, which I had surprised for he turned to me, and in simple later, with genuine concern upon his features. I am sorry to hear this. I only know Mr. Holmes through some business delines which we have had, but I have ever respected his talents and his character. He is an amateur of crime as I am of disease. For him, the villain, for me, the microbe. There are my prisons. He continued pointing to a row of bottles and jars, which stood upon a side table. Among those gelatin cultivation, some of the very worst offenders in the world are now doing time. It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr. Holmes desired to see you. He has a higher opinion of you, and thought that you were the one man in London who could help him. The little man started as a jointly smoking caps slither floor. Why? He asked. Why should Mr. Holmes think that I could help him in his trouble? Because of your knowledge, your Eastern diseases. But why should he think that the disease which he has contracted is his turn? Because, in some professional inquiry, he has been working on Chinese sailors down in the dogs. Mr. Cowards and Smith, small pleasantly, and picked up his smoking cap. Oh, that's it, is it? I trust the matter is not so great as you suppose. How long has he been ill? About three days. Is he delirious? Okay, can we? Touch, touch. This sounds serious. It would be inhuman not dancers call. I very much resent any interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but this case is certainly exceptional. I will come with you at once. I remember, Holmes' injunction. I have another appointment. Say, I. Very good. I will go alone. I have a note of Mr. Holmes address. You can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most. It was with this thinking heart that I re-empted Holmes' bedroom. For all the time, you, the worst might have happened in my absence. To my enormously, he had greatly improved in the interval. His appearance was as ghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left him, and he spoke in a feeble voice. It is true, but with even more than his usual Christmas and lucidity. Well, did you see him Watson? Yes, he is coming. Adorable Watson, admirable. You are the best of messengers. He wished to return with me. That would never do Watson. That would be obviously impossible. Did he ask God to alote me? I told him about the Chinese in the East End. Exactly. Well Watson, you have done all that a good friend could. You can now disappear from the scene. I am his weight, and here he is a opinion Holmes. Of course you must. But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion would be very much more frank and valuable. If he imagines that we are alone, there is just room behind the head of my bed Watson. My dear Holmes. I fear there is no alternative Watson. The room does not lend itself to concealment, which is as well as it is the less likely to arouse suspicion. But just there Watson, I fancy that it could be done. Suddenly he sat up with the rich and intent in the pond his Haggiel face. There are the wheels Watson. Quick man if you love me, and don't punch whatever happens. Whatever happens, do you hear? Don't speak, don't move, just listen with all your ears. Then in an instant his sudden access of strength departed, and his masterful purposeful talk, from the way to the low vague murmurings of a semi-dularious man. From the hiding place into which I have been so swiftly hossled, I heard the footfalls upon the stair, with the opening enclosing of the bedroom door. Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence, broken only by the heavy breathing and gaspets of the sick man. I could imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and looking down at the sufferer. At last that strange hush we broken. Holmes. He cried. Holmes. In the insistent tones of one who awakes a sweeper. Can't you hear me, Holmes? There was a rustling, as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder. Is that you, Mr. Smith? Holmes whispered. I hardly dared hope that you would come. The earth had laughed. I should imagine not. He said. And yet, you see, I am here. Coles of fire, Holmes. Coles of fire. It is very good of you. Very noble of you. I appreciate your special knowledge. I will visit this, think it. You do. You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do you know what is the matter with you? The same. Said Holmes. Ah, you recognize the symptoms. Only too well. Well, I shouldn't be surprised, Holmes. I shouldn't be surprised if it were the same. A bad look out for you if it is. Poor Victor was a dead man on the fourth day. A strong, hearty young fellow. It was certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an out of the way as you had a disease in the heart of London. A disease, too, of which I had made such a very special study. Singular coincidence, Holmes. Very smart of you to notice it. But rather uncharitable, it is just that it was cause and effect. I knew that you did it. Oh, you did, did you? Well, you couldn't prove it anyhow. But what do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that? And then crawling to me for help, the moment you are in trouble. What sort of a game is that, eh? I heard the rough thing, ladies, breathing of this sick man. Give me the water. He got her. You're a precious near your end, my friend. But I don't want you to go until I've had a word with you. That's why I give you water. There. Don't slap it about. That's right. Can you understand what I say? Holmes, groan. Oh, do what you can for me. Let bygones be bygones. You whispered. I'll put the words out of my head. I swear I will. Only cure me. And I'll forget it. Forget what? I'll forget about Victor Savage's death. You as good as it missed it. Just now that you had to done it, I'll forget it. You can forget it. Or remember it? Just as you like. I don't see you in the witness box. Glide another shaped box, my good Holmes. I assure you. It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died. It's not him we are talking about. It's you. Yes. Yes. The fellow who came for me. I forgot in his name, so that you contracted it down in the east end among the sailors. I could only account for it, so. You are proud of your brains, Holmes. Are you not? Think yourself smart. Don't you? You came across someone who was smarter this time. Now, cast your mind back, Holmes. Can you think of no other way? You could have got this thing. I can't think. My mind is gone. For heaven's sake. Help me. Yes. I will help you. I'll help you understand just where you are. And how you got there. I'd like you to know before you die. Give me something to ease my pain. Painful, is it? Yes. The coolies used to do some squealing in the end. Take she was a crab by fancy. Yes. Yes. It is cramp. Well, you can hear what I say anyhow. Listen now. Can you remember any unusual incident in your life? Just about the time your symptoms began? No. No. Nothing. Think again. I'm too ill to think. Well then, I'll help you. Did anything come by post? But post? A box by chance? I'm fainting. I'm gone. Listen, Holmes. There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying man. And it was all I could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding place. You must hear me. You shall hear me. Do you remember a box and I every box? It came on Wednesday. You opened it. Do you remember? Yes. Yes. I opened it. Those shops bring inside it. Some joke. It was no joke as you will find your cost. You fool. You would have it and you have got it. Who asked you to cross my path? If you had left me alone, I would not have hurt you. I remember, Holmes. The spring. It's true blood. This box. This on the table. The very one by George. And it may as well leave the room in my pocket. There goes your last shred of evidence. But you have the truth. Now Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that I killed you. You knew too much of the Vadevictor's avid. So I have sent you to share it. You are very near your end, Holmes. I will sit here and I will watch you die. Holmes, the voice had sunk to an almost innable whisper. What is that? Sets me. Turn up the gas. Ah, the shadows begin to fall. Yes. I will turn it up that I may see you the better. He crossed the room and the lights suddenly brightened. Is there any other little service that I can do to my friend? A mad, gender cigarette. I nearly called out in my joy, am I am asmen? He was speaking in his natural voice. A little weak, perhaps. But the very voice I knew. There was a long pause, and I felt that co-witz and Smith was standing in certain the maidsmen looking down at his companion. What's the meaning of this? I heard him say it last in a dry, roughing tone. The best way of successfully acting apart is to be it. Said Holmes. I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither food nor drink, until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water. But it is the tobacco which I find most irks. Ah, here are some cigarettes. I heard the striking of a man. That is very much better. Hello? Hello? Do I hear the step of a friend? There were footfalls outside, the door opened, and inspect a north and a pier. All is in order, and this is your man. Said Holmes. The officer gave the usual caution. I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage. He concluded. And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes. Really marked my friend with a chuckle. To save an invalid trouble, inspector, Mr. Colvert and Smith was good enough to give our signal by turning up the gas. By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the right hand pocket of his coat, which it would be as well to remove. Thank you. I would handle it gingerly if I were you. Put it down here. It's made play it's part in the trial. There was a sudden rush and a scuffle followed by the classroom iron and a cry of pain. You'll only get yourself hurt. Said the inspector. Stand still, will you? There was a click of the closing handcuffs. A nice trap. Cried the high-snowling voice. It will bring you into the dark Holmes not me. He asked me to come here. I was sorry for him and I came. Now he will pretend no doubt that I have said anything which he may invent, which will corroborate his insane suspicions. You can lie as you like Holmes. My word is always as good as yours. Good heavens. Cried home. I had totally forgotten him. My dear Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies to think that I should have overlooked you. I need not introduce you to Mr. Colvert and Smith. Since I understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening, have you the camp below? I will follow you when I am dressed, for I may be a some use at the station. I never needed it more. Said Holmes as he refreshed himself for the glass of clarinet and to biscuits in the interval of his toilet. However, as you know, my habits are irregular and such a feat means less to me than to most men. It was very essential that I should impress Mrs. Hudson with the reality of my condition since she was to convey it to you and you in turn to him. You won't be offended, Watson. You will realise that among your many talents, dissimulation finds no place and that if you had shared my secret, you would never have been able to impress Smith with the urgent necessity of his presence, which was the vital point of the whole scheme. In his vindictive nature, I was perfectly certain that he would come to look upon his handiwork. But your appearance, Holmes, your glassly face. Three days of absolute fast does not improve one's beauty, Watson. For the rest there is nothing which a sponge may not cure. With Vaseline upon one's forehead, Bella Donna in one's eyes, rouge over the cheekbones and crusts of beeswax round one's lips. This satisfying effect can be produced. Now lingering is a subject upon which I have sometimes sort of writing a monograph. A little occasional talk about half crowns, oysters or any other extraneous subject produces a pleasing effect of dillierium. But why would you not let me know since there was in truth no intention? Can you ask my dear Watson? Do you imagine that I have no respect for your medical talents? Could I fancy that your astute judgment would pass a dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or temperature? At four yards I could deceive you. If I failed to do so, who would bring my Smith within my grasp? No Watson, I would not touch that box. You can just see if you look at it sideways, where the sharp spring, like a Viper's tooth, emerges as you open it. I dare say it was by some such device that poor savage who stood between this monster and a reversion was done to death. My correspondence, however, is, as you know, a very dwell, and I am somewhat upon my guard, against any packages which reached me. It was clear to me, however, that by pretending that he had really succeeded in his design, I might surprise a confession. That pretends I have carried out with the thoroughness of the true artist. Thank you Watson. You must help me on with my coat. When we have finished at the police station, I think that something nutritious at Simpsons would not be out of place.

Permit me to announce the subject of the comedy, which is about to be presented. And to address you in the new logic of the personages who are to appear in it. Ladies and gentlemen. Inevitably it treats of love. Love. Love. I wish, ladies and gentlemen, I wore a poet at this moment, so that I might present to you in a nose gay of the sweetest smelling syllables. A panjurric of that dear misfortune, of that delightful pain that fatal passion. That enchantment, that irresistible effluence of the stars, that fierce consuming of the soul, that death-dilling microbe, or whatever it is that you may decide this delicious inquired to be, which, through all the centuries, men and women, have agreed to call, love. You would listen to maize, if I were such a poet, to the crackling and sentilation of my metaphors. You would admire and marvel at the unstable shifting winds, the soft unfolding flowers, the broad expanse of heaven, the silver fountains, the caverns, the eagles, the sun rays, and the moon beams, and all the twinkling stars which I should make dance before you upon the rope of my imagination to embellish my discourse. You would twittle your thumbs with the light, ladies and gentlemen, listening to my discourse, if I were a poet. But I have already told you that I am not one, I am only a marionette, and a prologue. I see you smile, smile then, but don't disdain me, to be these two things at one in the same time, one must amount to something. Marionette, I see you laugh, joy sparkles in all your eyes. Do you suppose that it is a small thing to have a name, the very mention of which is enough to make people laugh, and do you suppose that it is nothing, when you have it, to be able to live up to it throughout the ages, and to uphold such a reputation with a dignity which, after all, is purely ridiculous. And we have upheld it, yes we have ladies and gentlemen, splendidly, like kings and princes, our little bodies are our witnesses. To win applause, they just join themselves, twist and turn, and bend backward, throw off their arms and heads into the air, or lose a leg in a high-prens, to get it back again in a pirouette. See, we palpitate from head to foot, every inch of us, as if our bodies were all hearts. And yet ladies and gentlemen, beyond it out we have no hearts. What should we need of them when we vibrate and fly from one thing to another so continuously without them? But, Mr. Prologue, how can Marionette's love if they have no hearts? I did not say that they could love my dear young lady. Didn't you say, Mr. Prologue, that your comedy was about love? That is exactly it. It is about love, but it is a comedy. Oh! But do not be sad, beautiful black eyes, for our comedy will be incomparably played, all the love in the world could never discover love or size anywhere, which would be like those of Columbine. Good, good. Are you going to tell us about Columbine? Why not? No then, that she is white, but not pale, because in each of her cheeks every instant, our row is as about to be born. She has painted her lips with the red of poppies, and one day when she sat down to dream, making out or remetto, two violets sprang up and jumped into her eyes. Since then, nobody has been able to tell whether her glances were fragrance or light, and out of the sweet confusion, as out of all beautiful confusions, a harmonious brings, which we call music. And so the look of Columbine is a song. Marionette listening to her sing and hearing her laugh, men have gone mad. So her mind is like a wonderful bird cage, filled with nightingales, which, like all captive nightingales, feed upon hearts, upon her heart. That is why Columbine is unfaithful to payroll. Sometimes to feed her heart. For payroll, who is a Marionette and a poppid as she is, refuses her the heart's meat on which, as I have told you, the nightingales feed. Good, good, now tell us about parole. What shall I tell you about, Pyrrhal? His mind is like a sun beam which is fallen into a globe of crystal and clear water, and all the colors are there in it, except one, which is constancy. You see today he imagines he is a philosopher, but out of his philosophy, roses bring, so that our comedy which begins with a sigh, ends with an embrace, or rather with two embraces, because hathokin, after he has sung his song so earnestly, and too such uttered is stain, consoles himself a love by loving, and for the kisses which he cannot get by those the girls will give. For this is the proper way all love song should end. Why, and sing them gentlemen, you will always find some ear that is willing to hear. And you, beautiful ladies, listen to the song of love while it is floating in the air, and catch it on the wing, for you will find that it is tame and it thrives in captivity. As Pyrrhalet, if the kisses have not turned to honey, which he has taken in when they lost their way, and had nowhere else to go. Now ladies and gentlemen, I can only add that wisdom is about to appear upon the stage of our farce, but the triumph of folly will oblige him soon to break his wand. The curtain rises, the comedy begins, this is the garden. I forgot to tell you that the stage represents a garden. Open your ears, for the fountain begins to play. In your eyes, for the roses are bursting into bloom. The prologue retires. Scene one. In Pyrrhalet's garden, there is an arbor with rustic benches at the right. It is spring. Trees with bushes drooped their mouths, laid in heavily with flowers, perfume in all the air. The breezes sing with the voices of birds in the sky smiles bright with sunshine. Some binds seated within the arbor whose foliage conceals are almost completely, seems wrapped in mill and cauliflower. Pyrrhal walks up and down at the rear, musim, and gazing contemplatively from the sky to the ground, and from the ground to the sky, lingering lovingly before the flowering trees, and talking to the flowers. Pyrrhal declaiming. Oh nature, mother without beginning and without ending, beyond the touch of time, what can I do to merit all thy gifts? Rose is a fire. How can I ever hope to know the mystery which is flaming at your hearts? Lillies, how can I penetrate the secrets of your petals of heights now? Thanks, thanks so beauty thanks, but there has to range that I've veiled before my eyes, and in contemplation of thy treasures I must end my life. Pyrrhal, disappearing lost in the depths of the garden. Thanks, thanks a thousand thanks. I value my vision and my poach dreams above all the splendors and above all the loves of earth and heaven. Whoa, isn't me! Enter, senior polish nell quickly. For now, senior perro is wrapped in his meditations. He will not discover that you are here. Enter. Did you say that your mistress has sent for me? Oh, how eagerly senior match could I but make you understand how wretched the poor child has been? Has it not pierced the very soul to look at her? She spends all the day and in a night time sign, she has faded away so fast. That divine form of hers is not what it once was, the last. A last. How oblivious men are to such things in your magic. Not all men. My ladies like the driven snows of heaven to her spouse. Only in a round toward the back with the menacing gesture. Ah, senior perro. Senior perro. Oh, I think column vines discovered us. Columdine coming out of the arbor and advancing in tears towards porch nell. Ah, senior magician, how impatiently I have awaited your arrival? Columdine bowing. Bring chest, pirate. Oh, what was me? Do not sigh, lady. I am so unhappy. I congratulate you. Have fun being unhappy? No. Upon finding that your beauty has not faded so fast as I had been led to suppose. Of course, I had heard from pirate. Pirette returning with the chairs. What do you know about such things you all don't out? Don't sense. I suppose a woman's beauty is like an article of religion in your eyes. There's no more to it than seen and believing. Leave us, pirate. Pirette, before retiring, she looks towards the rear where it is to be suppose that she sees pirette. There he is now. Look at him, bending over the roses and I dare say composing verses in their praise. I would hand him a bunch of roses if he had the honor to be my spouse. Ah, senior poro. Unhappyest of men. Don't you know that you are not the only poet in the world? That there are others who compose as beautiful verses as you do and to better purpose. The notes of a sithor are heard in the distance. Didn't I tell you, it is good Harlequin. Harlequin singing. White roses are her forehead, the waving green her hair, the stars her eyes. I love Esther pure her shoulder and the beauties that enfolder the starry skies. Who would not be of the roses or the grain that is in her hair her starry eyes. Or her neck of I'll abaster, serve and slave when she is master her deep heart's eyes. The words are heard afar off linked with a hunting melody. Pureetta listens, entranced, emphasizing them with gestures of approval. Column-bine rises indignantly, the first densest scarcely concluded and presently addresses pureette. Pureette. Lady. Didn't I command you to send that imparting and fellow away? His music is displeasing to my ear. In compliance with your command, I shall negate in his face and the body of your lover remains outside in the alley, so are distressed. But his spirit, woe is me, is an immaterial thing. And who can deprive senior Harlequin with the consolation of sending it after you, wherever you may be, on the wings of his songs. Go and tell him that he offends me with his music. I would not be to severe with him if I were you. But how can it do, just to hear? A piercett. Pureette, as she turns to go. All, all are blindly in love with the impossible. My lady with her husband, Harlequin with my lady, and with me, nobody, which allows his only two possible. Column-bine sinks again into her chair and size weirdly. Woe she now, wately perplexed. But will you be kind enough to explain to me what the matter is? What is the meaning of these tears? These songs of Harlequin's is an explicable discontent upon the part of your mate. Why all this mystery? I haven't distracted. I shall go out of my head. Ah, senior polygina. Love is the most mysterious thing in the world. I shall be so sorry to have you a thing so. Love is a natural function. It is symbol, perfect is symbol. The difficulty is that we complicated with spiritual distinctions. Ah, that is where the trouble begins. Nature is never willing to have man improve upon her processes. The fact is. The fact is that my husband does not love me. What do you say? What is that? Pierro is deceiving you? He is not even deceiving me. Oh, if only once he would deceive me, then at least I might be thankful that he had had the grace to consider me to make some effort to preserve my ideals. My rival, senior mage, is nature. Poshanella is dumbfounded. Yes. Pierro is a poet, the most miserable he, he adores the carmine in the roses, but he distains it upon my lips. He worships the asger of the overarching sky, but he cannot see it in the teadrop which glistens in my eye. He drinks sweet perfumes on the breezes, but he will not co-often from the surface which are wafted from my mouth. Oh, woe is me, woe is me. Pierro a poet, you're right. Poetry in marriage is entirely out of place. It is an intruder and interloper, like anything else which we do not expect. But these songs of harlecoins? They are another complication, senior mage. My misfortune, thanks to the little pains which my husband takes to deceive me, has become known to all men, and harlek in haste the audacity to presume to console me for it. He wishes me to follow the old, a dutch, which says that love is cured by love. He, woe is it that he wishes you to do. Oh, he has no fear, I shall not follow his advice. You are right, for this notion that love can be cured by love is sheer nonsense. Believe me, there is no cure for anything on earth outside of science. You could trust me for that senior. I'm a wise old man. That is the reason I have sent for you. You have done well, my daughter. He meditates. You say that your husband has deserted you. He has abandoned his tired of you. He writes furses, or these are bad signs, very bad. However, fortunately. Oh, is there no remedy? One, which is well-nine, fallable. He draws a crystal file from the recesses of his robe. Take this file. He has been brewed a filter, compounded by magic art out of the essence of your tears. But what shall I do with this filter? Whenever P.I.R.O. is pensive and absorbed, wrapped in his poetic ecstasy, let forber 200 up from his file, and both he, add here. I do not understand. Listen, for example, you say the P.I.R.O. is in raptured with the asurer of the skies. It's a little but one drop, let forber, but one tear, and the sky will be covered with thick clouds in his sight. Oh, I understand. So little, by little, our, by our, he will become disinjunted with all natural beauty. You will turn again to yours. Which also is natural, believe me, senior mage? I believe you are too well, I do. How can I ever thank you? Do not thank me too much, or your gratitude will overcome my wisdom, and they prostrate in the dust. Senior aura. He bows and retires. I am saved. He retires. P.I.R.O. Come and rejoice with me. P.I.R.O. to disappoint him. Do you mean that is to say, has the sage found a remedy? Then? In devouring to conceal a note which he is carrying in her hand. What is that? What paper are you trying to conceal? She ceases it. A letter from howl again, is this the way that you obey my commands? I gave you a message to senior harlequin, and he was cast down into the other most depths, when he heard that his song had given you pain. And so, to prove that he intended no offense, he has written at the verses on this piece of paper, which he begged me to put into your hands. But if you do not wish it, no, let me see. Surely I ought to read what they are. It is my duty to make an example of him, a horrible example. She runs her eye over the paper. No, words and phrases of fire. Fire shall put out your fire. My lord, my lady. Spirit of God, aid me now. We row enters. He carries a bunch of purple roses in his hand. As he advances, he gazes lovin' leaf from flower to flower, and begins meditatively to recite the verses which he has composed in their praise. Pappal-patthos-rich, you, God has shed his blood for you. Column-buying lets the first drop fall from the vile. A. Column-buying running up to him. What is the matter? Thorn pierced my hand. My love, believed the roses for the affull of thorns. She takes the flowers from Pera's hands and dashes them vitally upon the ground. They leave a purple trail behind them as they pass through the air, and then fall, there's dimms bear. Pera's watches them fall, and size heavily. Column-buying flings herself into his arms. What are you thinking of? What is on your mind? Don't you know that my love is a flower that can never be stripped bare? Seen two. Pera's garden in autumn. There are no more flowers in it. Only a few pallid roses and some hearty-crisis-thumums. At the back glows the red of the setting sun. Above little white clouds are driven fitfully across the sky, while at intervals gusts of wind shake the trees and scatter the dry leaves upon the ground, or rustle them about in restless golden whirls. Column-buying and pushing now are seated in the garden. Column-buying is even more melancholy than in the first scene. But it is clearly possible, do you say that my remedy produced no effect? A most marvellous effect. Frankly then, I do not understand. The remedy was worse than the disease. Pera has ceased to be a poet, but he has become a philosopher. A philosopher? Yes, so much more miserable he? He will feel the worst two efficacious. For days now there has been no sky without clouds for Pera, no rose without a thorn, no pleasure without loathing and disgust. Even the perfume of the flowers gives him pain so that I, too, have almost begun to pity him. But have you manifested your pity with tenderness and affection? As affectionate as I was able, but less when my husband disillusioned with the perfidies and imperfections of nature turned to hate and despise them, he took it into his head that my beauty also was a natural thing, and it has been impossible to disuse him of it. You can imagine the consequence. My lips seemed to him like roses, my eyes like the sea or the sky, my hair like the sunbeams, and not only that, but Pera has discovered in various parts of my person, all the blots, scar, stains, blemishes, tempest sense, domed clouds that afflict the universe or offend the sense of beauty. I am worse often I was before senior mage. A pause in suicide. Have you known you remedy to prescribe for this new evil? It will be difficult in your calm mind. It seems that the spirit of your husband is up to you right to love. If you could only learn to forget to resign yourself. Instead all your boasted science can do? No then that I do not wish to resign myself. I wish to love. I am looking for a cure, not for consolation. Do not be angry with me, lady. The problem is stubborn and involved. But I shall study it in my laboratory, and I swear to you that I will never emerge from it. As long as I shall live, I must have found an infarvel medicine. He goes out. Science and wisdom here. Perait enters. Wisdom? I shall like to know what wisdom has got to do with love. What has that old impasse to know about it anyway? At his age. Age is a guarantee of knowledge. Not to me. It may be in some things, but in affairs of the heart, practice makes more perfect and learning. In love, experience is the key which opens hearts. If it is not used, it rusts. And I do not need to ask you how long it must be, since senior polish in hell has used his key. Where you always destroy my illusions, Perait? Yes. Because when reality is with a thousand illusions, senior harlequin. Do not talk to me about harlequin. Senior harlequin is a reality. Believe me, my lady. There is no illusion about him. I know, and I can answer for it. Besides, you must be convinced by this time that all the drugs of all the sorcerers are of no avail to win back the heart of senior perro. Unless, so I am. Who is me? So that you will never find a remedy through the aid of science? I fear it. Leave it to me then. And let me put my plan into execution. What plan? What is it that you wish to do? You will soon see. Without any other science than experience, which I have picked up on my way through the world, I shall save you. The first thing to do is to receive harlequin. Perait. Though it be only to undiseave him, one angry word from your lips would have a thousand times more effect than a thousand sermons from mine, which to tell the truth, who are not made for sermons. But in any case, he is here. Harlequin enters and throws himself a column by his feet. Queen of my soul, son of my spirit, a magnet in pole of my desire. What is this? Rise. Perait is this the way that you obey my commands. Pardon lady. But it is too much for you to expect me to stand forever between the fire and the wall. You don't know to what dangers I have been exposed, contending continually against the ardors of senior harlequin. My lady, in turn I be seek you to pardon Perait. It was not her negligence, but my audacity which caused this wrong. If wrong it be. How? Does the heart overwhelm the darkness sin because it desires the light? This desire is one thing, performance is another. Column by in the mind of lovers, desire is performance. The desires of love are mandates, perimptory as the rules of life. You blaspheme sin your harlequin, certain need to love like this is a crime. What matters so long has it is love, do not shrink and draw away from me. Move closer lady, at least listen to my tale of war, grant me this solace. Where do you promise to go away then immediately if I do? If you ask me to, and will you promise never to come back? If you are not convinced by my arguments, you may talk. Thanks. He kisses her hand. I said talk. My lady, that was the irrepressible cry of my soul. You have a soul that has been most rudely brought up. Perait to Column by. Good, lead him on. My lady, for my soul and for me, we have both hungered through so many ages for a sight of this glory, that now when we find ourselves in your presence, my soul and I face to face. It is small wonder that we forget our ill fortune, and become boys again, and throw to the winds or sense of proper restraint. Which my dignity cannot excuse in your heart again. But your love and your sympathy ought to excuse it. Do you presume to talk to me of art? What they're not to be many oughts between you and me, Column by. Outs and never an ought not. Between you and me, you. Let's Column by. Me. It is not for my sake. It may not be through your faults. I like that better. But it is the same to me. My misery is the same because I love you, Column by. I love you. I love you so much that when I love you all I can, I hate myself. I'm unhappy that I am because I cannot love you more. I love you. I love you. I love you. Each time that he says I love you, he kisses her hands passionately. Column by defending herself a little, but did not this please did heart. Not so loud in your heart again, not so loud. There may be an echo in the garden. They wander off at the rear pursuing the debate and disappear. I should never have believed it possible that the grief of my mistress would have been so difficult to console. Ah, me. Piro enters. He carries a book in his hands. He reads and meditates. To think that even in the due drops, the radiant tears of morning, there is a world of monsters, a contending universe of pain, to know that the smiling verger of the field is but the mask of foul decay, the immortal beauty which we love, the veil and dull similitude of death. He paces back and forth absorbed in his meditations. Piroto approaching him sympathetically. Senior, Piro. Who speaks to me? Ah, is it you? Why are you smiling? Why are you so happy? Senior, life is beautiful. Do you know what you pair within? A skeleton, a void, nothing. A pause follows. Where is your lady? She was here a moment since. So wretched over your philosophy. She was in tears. And now she is consoling herself that is to say she has company, senior hallachwyn. Harachwyn? A most extraordinary young man, proud, handsome, amorous. What is that? And an excellent poet. My lady could not possibly have chosen better company. What do you say? Why do you tell me these things? Because they are true. What makes you look at me like this? I was counting sadly the wrinkles which the less of you dug into your brow. Tell Colin behind that I wish to see her. Do you think it will be wise to interrupt them now? Is she so intent upon that visit? Look and see. There they are. Piroto retires and appears through the shrubbery. Do you see anything? That harlequin is a fool. Oh no, he is not. Why? All the while one is with him. He has such winning ways. Colin behind laughs. Ha ha. My lady laughs. Poor lady. It is so long since I have heard her laugh. Ah, look. I wondered what they were doing. There was a happy stroke of senior hallachwyns. But what is the matter? Piro starts to run and rush his head long up the stage like what possessed. Where are you going? Ha ha ha. See him run. A jealous man is always ridiculous. There he is now. He is furious. My lady pleads from mercy. And senior harlequin? He effaces himself. He fades mudously out of sight. I'm sorry for that man. The sound of rude voices has heard in the garden. Shortly afterward, harlequin emerges from the trees. He comes forward with a dejected, disappointed air, and hurried rapidly across the stage. Piroto detain him. What is the matter senior harlequin? Was that my lady willing to be consoled? Your lady is a model of conjugal fidelity. Who told you to go wandering in other people's gardens? Exploring hearts which have masters. Better stick to the highways in the highways senior rover and to fields which are virgin. Do you know any? There is a reflection upon me. What do you mean senior harlequin? I mean any disposed to receive me? Why senior harlequin? I...what do you want me to say? I am a young and inexperienced girl, but I am sure that there must be someone. Perhaps not so very far away. You know what the song says when you least expected? And I never expected it. Don't look at me like that. Apause ensues. Piroto eyes become eloquent in the silence of her lips. And pronounce a significant discourse. Harlequin with sudden resolution. Could you love me, Piroto? Do you think I win my victories, the other people's arms? Don't be cruel. My lady is much more beautiful than I. Illusion. The beauty of women is all a one great store. Unfast and perfect body in which every woman is but an individual part. Your lady is beautiful. You are as beautiful as she. Both different parts of the same great beauty. But I wonder just what part of this great beauty that you tell me of, am I? From what I feel, you must be very near the harlequin. Piro and Columbine re-enter an advance into the garden. They also are locked in an embrace and gaze steadfastly into each other's eyes. Full of happiness. Swear to me that you are telling me the truth, Piero. I swear it. The fear of losing you has revealed to me the truth that you love with the soul of my life. Your words are the most beautiful of poems and your embraces the most enduring of philosophies. Portionel inter-empercipitously with a file in his hand. Signure, here is the filter, the love metric, the true, the infallible medicine. The whole left gale, imperial careouser and pertinent, so far as to mend the magician with many ecomic grievous. Portionel stares at them in amazement. The file which he carries in his hands explodes with a loud report and the elixir of love is scattered upon the ground. It was about time to explode it. Watch this, I see. What you see, Senior Magis and play this. That science is superfluous but it comes to affairs of the heart. They are all wisdom as vain and all filters are colored water, for love is cured by love and is stained by jealousy. So it has been since the beginning of the world and so it will be into the world as ceased to be. Spells and conjurations are a very little use. The love that is fallen asleep through excess of good fortune is not to be awakened again without the menace of another love which is more passionate and which burns like youth's fire. Though that is all there is to it, my master was asleep because my lady loved him too much and he has waked at the fear that she might cease to love him so. Don't you see? Um, what I see? But, put in at Holicon. Wasn't this gentleman also in love? Head over heels. You can surely see it? Horshinel, a protesting. But not with you? He thought not himself, but he soon found his mistake through my assistance and the force of circumstances. HMM. Although I am a young man, Senior Ponthinel and a poet, I too have my philosophy and in the first chapter, there is this amaxium. He who refuses to console himself for the kisses which he cannot get by those the girl will give. His mad entirely. The sorcerer is genuised, takes to his heels covering his ears with his hands, then throwing his arms into the air, brandishing them wildly. Soft, sweet music sounds, and the two pairs of lovers begin a slow and stately dance. Curtin.

He was quite excited as he told the story to his wife, and in the telling he revealed to her a depth of credulity of which she would not have believed him capable. He was a hard-headed man and conducted his business on hard-headed principles. Indeed, he had conducted his courtship and matrimonial affairs in a manner which she would not have termed reckless or romantic. When therefore she found him excited and over such a story, she did not know what to think. She ended by agreeing with him, not because her reason was satisfied or even touched, but simply because he was excited, and women generally welcome anything which disturbs or varies the dull round of use and want, and will bathe in excitement whenever they get the chance. This was the story he told. As he was walking down Grafton Street to lunch, a motor car came spinning down the road at a speed much too dangerous for that narrow and always congested the river. A man was walking in front of him and just as the car came behind, this man stepped off the path with a view to crossing the road. He did not even look behind as he stepped off. Her husband on that moment stretched for the long muscular arm, the swept to the man back to the pavement one second before the car went blaring and buzzing by. If I had not been there, said her husband. The two men grand at each other. Her husband smiling with good fellowship, the other crinkling with amusement and gratitude. They walked together down the street and they had lunch together. They sat for a long time after lunch, smoking innumerable cigarettes and engaged in a conversation which she could never have believed. Her husband would have stood for 10 minutes and they parted with an expressed wish from her husband that they should be to get on the following day and a wordless smile from the man. He had neither ratified nor negative the arrangement. I hope he'll turn up, set her husband. It was this conversation had excited her man for it had drawn him into a mental atmosphere to which he was a stranger and he had found himself moving there with such ease and pleasure that he wished to get back to it as often and with as little delay as possible. Briefly as he explained it to her, the atmosphere was religious and while it was entirely intellectual, it was more heavy and exhilarating than the emotional religion to which he had been accustomed and from which he had long since passed. He tried to describe his companion but had such ill success that she could not remember afterwards whether he was tall or short, fat or thin, fair or dark. It was the man's eyes only he succeeded in emphasizing and these it appeared where eyes such as he had never before seen in a human face. That also he said was a wrong way of putting it. For his eyes were exactly like everybody else's. It was the way he looked through them that was different. Something very steady, very ardent, immensely quiet and powerful was using those eyes for purposes of vision. He had never met anyone who looked at him so directly, so comprehendingly, so agreeably. You are in love, said she with a laugh. After this, her husband's explanations became more explanatory but not less confused until she found that they were both with curious unconsciousness in the middle of a fairy tale. He asked me, said her husband, what was the thing I wished for beyond all things? That is the most difficult question I have ever been invited to answer he went on and for nearly half an hour, we set quietly thinking it out and discussing various magnificences and chances in life. I had all the usual thoughts and of course, the first of them was wealth. I mentioned it too tentatively as a possibility and he agreed that it was worth considering, but after a while I knew that I did not want money. When always has made of money, said his wife. In a way that is true, said he, but not in this way, for as I thought it over, I remembered that we have no children and that we have few desires which the money we have already gathered can not buy. Also, we are fairly well off. We have enough in the stocking to last our time, even if I ceased from business, which I am not going to do. And in short, I discovered that money or its purchasing power had not any particular advantages to offer. All the same said she and halted with her eyes fixed on bonnets far away in time and space. All the same he agreed with a smile. I could not think of anything worth wishing for, he continued. I mentioned health and wisdom and we spoke of these, but judging myself by the standard of the world in which we move, I concluded that both my health and knowledge were as good as the next man's. And I thought if I elected to become wiser than my contemporaries, I might be a very lonely person for the rest of my days. Yes, she said thoughtfully, I am glad you did not ask to be made wise, unless you could have asked it for the both of us. I asked him in the end what he would advise me to demand, but he replied that he could not advise me at all. Behind everything stands desire, said he, and you must find out your desire. I asked him then if the opportunity came to him where he would ask for, not in order that I might copy his wish, but from sheer curiosity. And he replied that he would not ask for anything, and I was about to adopt that attitude. Oh, said his wife, when an idea came to me. Here I am, I said to myself, 48 years of age, rich enough, sound enough in wind and limb, and as wise as I can afford to be. What is there now belonging to me? Absolutely mine, but from which I must part, and which I would like to keep. And I saw that the thing which was leaving me day by day, second by second, irretrivably and inevitably, was my 48 years. And I thought I would like to continue at the age of 48, until my time was up. I did not ask to live forever, or any of that nonsense, but I asked to be allowed to stay at the age of 48 years, with all the equipment of my present state unimpaired. You should not have asked for such a thing, said his wife, a little angrily, it is not fair to me. You are older than I am now, but in a few years, this will mean that I shall be needlessly older than you. I think it was not a loyal wish. I thought of that objection, said he, and I also thought that I was past the age at which certain things matter, and that both temperamentally and in the matter of years, I was proof against, well, say, feminine attractions, or feminineity of any kind. It seemed to me to be right. So I just registered my wish with him. But did he say she queried? He did not say anything, he just nodded, and began to talk again of other matters, religion, life, death, mind, a host of things, which for all the diversity, they seem to have, when I enumerate them, were yet one single thing. I feel a more contented man tonight than I have ever felt to continue, and I feel in some curious way a different person from the man I was yesterday. Here his wife woke up as it were from the conversation, and began to laugh. You are a foolish man, said she, and I am just as bad. If anyone were to hear us talking, this solemn silliness, he would have a right to mock at us. He laughed hardly with her, and after a supper they went to bed. During the night his wife had a dream. She dreamt that a ship set off for the polar seas on an expedition in which she was not sufficiently interested to find out its reason. The ship departed with her on board. For a time she was concerned with baggage and with counting and going over various articles, she had brought against the Arctic weather. She had thick woolen stockings, she had skin, boots, wool, hairy inside, all pliable and wrinkled without. She had a great skin cap shaped like a helmet and fitting down in a cape over the shoulders. She had even and did not astonish her, a pair of very baggy fur trousers. She had a sleeping sack. She had an enormous quantity of things, and everybody in the expedition was equipped if not with the same things, at least similarly. These traps were an unending subject of conversation aboard and although days and weeks passed, the talk of the ship hovered about and felt continually into the subject of warm clothing. There came a day when the weather began to be perceptibly colder, so cold indeed that she was tempted to draw on these wonderful breaches and fit her head into that most cozy hat, but she did not do so for and everybody on the ship explained it to her. It was necessary that she should accustom herself to the feeling of cold, and she was further informed the chill of what she was now feeling was nothing to the chill she would presently have to bear. It seemed good advice, and she decided that as long as she could bear the cold, she would do so, and would not put on any protective covering. Thus, when the cold became really intense, she would be to some degree ready for it, and would not suffer so much. But steadily and day by day, it became colder, and now they were in wild and whirling seas, were in great green and white icebergs went sailing by, and all about the ship, little Hummick survived and serty, and went under and came up, and the gray water slashed and hissed against and on top of these small he looks. Her hands were so chilly that she had to put them under her armpits to keep any warmth in them, and her feet were in a worse condition. They had begun to pain her, so she decided that on the next day, she would put on her winter equipment, and would not mind what anybody said to the contrary. It is cold enough, said she, from my Arctic trousers and my warm soft boots, and my great furry gloves, I will put them on in the morning, for it was then almost night, and she meant to go to bed at once. She did go to bed, and she lay there quite cold and miserable. In the morning, she was yet colder, and immediately on rising, she looked about for the winter clothing, which she had laid ready by the side of her buck, the night before, but she could not find them. She was forced to dress in her usual, rather thin clothes, and having done so, she went on neck. When she got to the side of the vessel, she found that the world about her was changed, the sea had disappeared. Far as the eye could go was a leveled plain of ice, not white, but gray, and over it, their lowered a sky gray as itself, and evolved off the same shade. Across this waist, there blew a bitter and piercing wind, so that her ears tingled and stung. No one was moving on the ship, and the dead silence which brooded on the snow, lay heavy and almost solid on the vessel. She ran to the other side and found that the whole ship's company had landed, and were staring at her from a little distance of the land, and these people were as silent as the frozen air, as the frozen ship. They stared at her and made no move and made no sound. She noticed that they were all dressed in their winter furs, and while she stood, ice began to creep into her veins. One of the ship's companies suddenly strode forward a few paces, and held up a bundle in his mittened hand. She saw the bundle contained her clothes, her broad furry trousers, her great cozy helmet and gloves. To get from the ship to the ice was painful, but not difficult, for a rope ladder was hanging against the side, and down this she went. The wrongs felt hard as iron for they were frozen stiff, and the touch of those glossy surfaces bits into her tender hand like fire. But she got to the ice and went across it towards her companions. Then to her dismay, to her terror, all these suddenly, with one unexpressed accord, turned and began to run swiftly away from her, and she with a heart that could scarcely beat, took after them. Every few paces she fell, for her shoes could not grip on the ice, and each time she fell, those monsters stood and turned and watched her, and the man who had her clothes waved the bundle at her, and danced to grow testically silently. She continued running, sliding, falling, picking herself up, until her breath went, and she came to a halt, unable to move a limb further, and scarcely able to breathe, and this time they did not stay to look at her. They continued running, but now with greater and greater speed, and she saw them become black specks away on the white distance, and she saw them disappear, and there was nothing left where she stared, with the long white miles, and the terrible silence, and the cold. How cold it was, and with that their rose again a little wind, keen as a razor which whipped into her face, swelled about her angles like a whip, and stabbed under her armpits like a dagger. I am cold, she buttered. She looked backwards when she had come, but the ship was no longer in sight, as she could not remember in what direction it lay. Then she began to run in any direction, indeed she ran in every direction to find the ship, for when she had taken and hundreds steps in one way, she thought, frankly, this is not the way, and it once she began to run on the opposite road, but run as she might, she could not get warm. It was colder, she got, and then she slipped again, and when sliding down a hollow, faster and faster, she came here to bring of a cleft and swished over this, and down into a hole of ice, and there she lay. I shall die, she said. I shall fall asleep here, and die. Then she awoke. She opened her eyes directly on the window, and saw the dawn struggling with the darkness, a film of grayish light which framed the window, but did not lift the obscurity of the room, as she lay for a second, smiling to herself at the grotesque dream, and thanking God, it had only been a dream. The next second she felt that she was cold. She pulled the clothes more tightly about her, and she spoke to her husband. How miserably cold it is, she said. She turned over in the bed and lay against him for warmth, and then she found that the atrocious cold came from him that it was he. She leaped out of the bed with his scream, switched on the light and bent over him. He was stoned dead. He was stoned cold, as she stood by him, shivering and whepering.

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Version 6 dramatic reading),Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,169472,8.0,"October 15, 2020",[],0,"libberocks.org. The advantages of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Coven Doyle. Section 1, a scandal in theemia. Dr John Watson read by Andrew Nixon. Sherlock Holmes read by Pity Wesley. I read by Beth Thomas. The king of Bohemia read by Bant Umer. Godfrey Norton read by Numer. By St Andrew read by Larry Wilson. I read made read by Amelia Tessley. To Sherlock Holmes, she is always the woman. I have seldom heard and mentioned her under any other name. In his eyes, he eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irwin Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were appalling to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced minds. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen. But as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of this off the passions, saved with a driver's nearing. They were admirable things for the observer. Excellent for drawing the veil for men's motives and actions. But for the trained reason that word meant such intruders into his own, a delicate and finely adjusted temperament. Was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grits in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-powered lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his, and yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Aryan Adler of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately, my marriage had drifted as away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-cented interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, was sufficient to observe all my attention, while Holmes, loathed every form of society with his whole behaviour and soul, remained in our lodging as in vagus-free, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drasiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation, in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hurtless by the official police. From time to time, I heard some vague account of his doings, of his summons to our desor, in the case of the crap-off murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Ackenson brothers at Trinkongoli, and finally, of the mission where he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland, the only signs of his activity, however, which I nearly shared with all the readers of the daily press, a new little of my former friend and companion. One night, it was on the 20th of March 1888, I was returning from a journey to a patient for I had now returned to civil practice, when my way led me through bank history, as I passed the well-rement of door, which must always be associated in my mind with my living, and with the dark incidents of the study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see homes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers, his rooms were brilliantly lit, and even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure passed twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the rooms swiftly, equally, with his head sunk upon his chest, and his hands clashed behind him. To me, in New York, his every mood and habit is attitude and manner told their own story, he was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-creating dreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been, in part, my own. His manner was not abusive, it seldom was, but he was glad, I think, to see me, with hardly a words spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an archer, through a cross his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case, and a gasigine in the corner, then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. Where do lock suits you? He remarked. I think what's in it you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you? Shen, I answered. Indeed, I should have thought a little more, just a trifle more, I found see what's in and in practice again, I am served. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness. And how do you know? I see it. I did do so. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl? My dear homes, said I. This is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday, and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes, I can't imagine how you did use it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice. But there, again, I failed to see how you worked it out. Each Uncle do himself, and rug his long nose hands together. It is simplicity itself, Shen. My eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the fire light strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously, they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the soul in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavie, as to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of Iodiform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forfinger, and a bowled on the right side of his top hat, to show where he has secreted his stethoscope. I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession. I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. When I hear you give your reasons, I remarked, the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I can easily do it myself, but each successive instance of your reasoning, I am dathalled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours. Quite so. He answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. You see, but you do not observe, the distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room, frequently, how often, well, some hundred of times, then how many are there? How many? I don't know. Quite so. You have not observed, and yet you have seen that is just my point. Now I know that there are 17 steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this. He threw over a sheet of thick, pinching, didn't know paper, which had been lying open from the table. It came by the last post, said he, read it aloud, the note was undated, and without either signature or addressed. There will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight o'clock, it said, a gentle man who decides to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one, who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance, which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then, at that hour, and do not take it a miss if you visit her where a mask. This is indeed a mystery. Oh, you know. Well, you might get in that it means. I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Incensibly, one begins to twist facts to suit theory, instead of theories to suit facts, but to note itself, what do you deduce from it? I carefully examine the writing, and the paper upon which was written. The man who wrote it was presumably well to do, are he marks, endeavoring to imitate my companions' processes. Such paper could not be brought under half a crown of packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff. Piculia, that is the very word, said Holmes. It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light. I did so, and so, a large E with a small G, and the P, and a large G with a small T, word into the texture of the paper. What do you make of that? I'll just Holmes. The name of the maker, though, doubt, or his monogram, rather. Not at all. The G with a small T stands for gazelle shaft, which is the German for company. It is a customary contract, and like our co. P, of course, stands for papier. Now for the EG, let us glance at our continental gazette here. He took down a heavy round volume from his shells. Iglau, iglau, it's... Ah, here we are, igria. It is in a German-speaking country in Bohemia, not far from Karlsbeid. Remocable as being the scene of the death of a valenstein, and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills. Aha, my boy, what do you make of that? His eyes sparkle, and he sent up a great blue triangle of his cigarette. The paper was made in Bohemia, I said. Precisely, and the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you know it's a peculiar construction of the sentence? This account of you we have from all quarters received. A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncurtious to his verbs. It only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this German, who writes upon Bohemia and paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I'm not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts. As he spoke, there was the sharp sound of horses' hooves, and grating wheels against the curb, followed by sharp pull of the bell. How is whistle? A pair by the sound? Said he. Yes, he continued, glancing out of the window. A nice little brown and a pair of beauties, a 150 gn is a piece. There's money in this case what's and if there is nothing else. I think that I had better go home. Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my boswell, and this, from a sister be interesting, it would be a pity to miss it. But you're quiet. Never mind him, I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes, sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your best attention. A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap. Come in, said Holmes, a man entered, who could hardly have been less than 16, 16 inches in height, with a chest and a lind of the hercules. His dress was rich with a richness of its wood in England. The looked upon as a king to bad taste, heavy bands of Asra Khan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch, which consisted of a single flaming barrel, boots which extended half of his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric oculence, which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a brawl, brim, tatinous hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheap bones, a black vis art mask, which he had apparently adjusted at that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of his face, he appeared to the amount of strong character with a thick hanging blit and a long-strait chin, suggested of red elution, pushed the length of the obstinacy. You had my note? He asked, with a deep part of voice and a strongly marked German accent. I told you that I would call, he looked from onto the other office, as if I was certain which to address. Pretty tick a seat. Said Holmes. This is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Who have I the honor to address? You may address me as the count from crum, a bohemian noble man. I understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honor and discretion, whom I may trust with the matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone. I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed him back as my chair. It is both on none. Said he. You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me, the count shrugged his broad shoulders. Then I must begin. Said he. By bending you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present, it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history. I promise. Said Holmes. And I. You will excuse this mask. Continue to strange visitor. The August person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own. I was aware of it. Said Holmes, Riley. The circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the raining families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great house of Armstrong. A redditary kings of Bohemia. I was also aware of that. Mermaid Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor collapsed with some apparent surprise at the language lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reason and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. If your majesty would condescend to state your case, he remarked, I should be better able to advise you. The man's prank from his chair and paste up and down the room in a uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and held it upon the ground. You are right. He cried. I am the king. Why should I attempt to conceal it? Why indeed? Mermaid Holmes. Your majesty had not spoken. Before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottstrak's biggest monde von Hormstein Grand Duke of Castle Thelstein and hereditary king of Bohemia. But you can understand? Siddar strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead. You can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in this power. I have come in cocked it all from Prague for the purpose of consulting you. Then, pre-consult. Siddar. Shutting his eyes once more. The facts are briefly these. Some five years ago during a lengthy visit to Warsaw I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventurous Irene Atlas. The name is No Doubt Familiar to you. Kindly look her up in my index doctor. Mermaid Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years, he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fishes. Let me see, Siddar Holmes. Born in New Jersey in the year 1858, control to Laskala. Prima Donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw. Yes, retired from operatic stage. Living in London quite sir. Your majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote to her some compromising letters and is now a desire of getting those letters back. Precisely so. But how was there a secret marriage? None. No legal papers or certificates. And then I failed to follow your man, if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity? There is a writing. Pha. Forgery. My private note paper. stolen. My own seal. imitated. My photograph. Bought. We were both in the photograph. Oh dear, that is very bad. Your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion. I was mad in saying. You have compromised yourself seriously. I was only crown prince then. I was young. I am about thirty now. It must be recovered. We have tried and failed. Your majesty must pay it must be bought. She will not sell. stolen then. Five attempts have been made. Twice brown gloves in my pay ran Zekhe House. Once we devoted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been wailed. There has been no result. No sign of it. Absolutely none. Hengla. This is quite a pretty little problem. She said he. But very serious want to me. Return the king reproredfully. Very indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph to ruin me? But how? I am about to be married. So I have heard. To clotilled love man from Zekhe's meaning and second daughter of the king of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself a very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end. And are you in battle? Threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful women and the mind of the most resolute of man. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go. None. You are sure that she has not sent it yet. I am sure. And why? Because she has sent that she would send it on the day when the brutal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday. Oh, then we have three days yet. Said home to the you on. That is very fortunate as I have what our two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will of course stay in London for the present. Certainly you will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count from Crump. Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress. I shall pray, do so. I shall be all anxiety. Then as to money, you have cartploss. Absolutely. I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph. And for present expenses, the king took a heavy shambal as a back from Sunday's cloak and laid it on the table. There are three hundred prounds in gold and seven hundred in notes. He said, home scribble the receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him. And marms the dress he asked. He asked, is Brian Iludch's affantine Avenue's in John's foot? Home to the note of it. One other question, said he, was the photograph a cabinet? It was. Then good night to your Majesty and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good night Watson. He added, as the wheels of the Royal Browon, rolled down the street. If you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock, I should like to chat this little matter over with you. At three o'clock precisely, I was at Baker Street, but homes had not yet returned. The landlord informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of waiting him. However long he might be. I was already deeply interested in a link or is for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features, which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded. Still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it to character of his own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand. There was something in his masterly grip of his situation and his keen in size of reasoning, which made it a pleasure to meet a study his system of work. And to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inexplicable mysteries. So our custom was eye to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter my head. It was closed at one for before the door opened, and a drunk looking groom, ill kebts inside whispered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. The custom, as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he, with a nod he vanished into the bedroom. And I went to him urge him five minutes, tweeted and respectable as a world. Putting his hand in his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed hardly for some minutes. Well, really, he cried, and then he choked him after gain, until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless in the chair. What is it? It's quite too funny. I'm sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing. I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habit, and perhaps the house, the misironing Adela. Quite so, but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and free-masonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Brian E. Lodge. It is a Beesu villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road. Two stories. Chabloc to the door? Large sitting room on the right side, well furnished with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners, which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage windows could be reached from the top of the coachhouse. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest. I then lounge down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a muse in a lane, which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the oscillors a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received an exchange, tuppance, a glass of half and half, two fills of shakta backo, and as much information, as I could desire about Miss Adler. To say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood, in whom I was not in the least interested, but, whose biographies I was compelled to listen to. And what do I mean Adler? Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the serpentine muse to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. So don't go out at other times, except when she sings, has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome and dashing. Never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a capman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine muse, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Bryney Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign. This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer that sounded ominous. What was the relation between them and what? The object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question, depending whether I should continue my work at Bryney Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties. If you are to understand the situation, I am following you closely. I am still balancing the matter in my mind, when a handsome cab drove up to Bryney Lodge and a gentleman's bring out, he was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aqualine, and mistarced. Evidently the man of whom I had heard, he appeared to be in a great hurry, shattered to the cab man to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door, with the heir of a man who was thoroughly at home. He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses off him in the windows of the sitting room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her, I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurry than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly. He shattered. First a gross and hanky's in region street, and then to the church a saint Monica in the edge where roared. Half a guinea if you do it in 20 minutes. A way they went and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them. When up the lane came a neat little landour, the coachman with his coat only half battled, at his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for. The church of Saint Monica John. She cried. And half a sovereign if you reach it in 20 minutes. This was quite too good to lose Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landour when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fair, but I jumped in before he could object. The church of Saint Monica said, I, and half a sovereign if you reach it in 20 minutes. It was 25 minutes to 12, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind. My cabbie drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landour were their steaming horses, were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there saved the two whom I had followed, and a serposed clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounced up the side eye, unlike any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and God for inought and came running as hard as he could towards me. Thank God. He cried. You'll do? Come. What's in? I asked. Come man. Come. Only three minutes or won't be legal. I was half dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was, I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing. And, generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, Spinster, to God for inought and bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other. While the clergyman peamed on me in front, it was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the brideroom from having to salient into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and that I mean to wear it on my watch, Jane, in memory of the occasion. This is a very unexpected turn of the therres, said I. And what then? Well, I found my plans very seriously, menest. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so an assesitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated. He driving back to the temple, and she to her own house. I shall drive out in the park at five as usual. She said as she left him, I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements, which are some cold beef and the glass of beer. He hunted, ringing the bell. I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busy as still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your cooperation. I shall be delighted. You don't mind breaking the law, not in the least. Nor running a chance of arrest. Not in a good cause. Oh, the cause is excellent. Then I am your man. I was sure that I might rely on you. But what did it you is? When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray, I will make it clear to you. Now he said, as he turned hungry on the simple fare that I will land lady and provide it. I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours, we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene or Madam, rather, returns home from her drive at seven. We must be at Briany lodge to meet her, and will then you must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere. Come what may. You understand? I am too usual. To do nothing, whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards. The sitting room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window. Yes. You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you. Yes. And when I raise my hand. So you will throw into the room what I give you to throw. And will at the same time raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me. Intilely. It is nothing very formidable. He said, taking a long cigar shaped roll from his pocket. It is an ordinary plummers smoke rocket. Fitted with a cap of either end to make itself lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up. By quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street. And I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear. I am too remain neutral to get near the window. To watch you. And that the signal to throw in this object. Then raise the cry of fire. And to what you have the corner of the street. Precisely. Then you may entirely rely on me. That is excellent. I think perhaps. It is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play. He disappeared into his bedroom. And returned in a few minutes in the character of an amybore and simple-minded, non-conformist Clogium. His broad black hand, his baggy trousers, is white tie. His sympathetic smile. And General look of pairing and benevolent curiosity, was such as Mr. John Harrellone, could have be equaled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, is very soul-seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor. Even a science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime. It was a quarter past six when we left Bakus' street and it still was a ten minute to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as he placed up and down in front of Brian Hillard, waiting for the common of his occupant. The house was just such as I had picked it from Sherlock Holmes's succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighborhood that was remarkably animated, there was a group of shabbydress men smoking and laughing in a corner. Osset's grinder with his will. Two guardwins who were flirting with the night's go and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with the guards in the house. You see? Remote tone has been paced to and fro in front of the house. This marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-aged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as a verse to its being seen by Mr. Gottfried Norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, where are we to find the photograph? Where indeed? It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the king is capable of having her way laid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it then that she does not carry it about with her. Where then? Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what, indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a businessman. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay in her hands upon it. It must be in her own house, but it has twice been burgled. Shit. They did not know how to look. But how will you look? I will not look. What then? I will get her to show me. But she will refuse. She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter. As he spoke, the gleam of the sidelines of the carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landout which rattle up to the door of Brianny lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loathing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper. But was Albert away by another loathe who had brushed up with the same intention. A fierce coral broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sight with one of the lounges. And by the scissors grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow is struck, and in an instant bloody who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck sabbically at each other with their fists and sticks. Homes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady. But just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall, the guard went up to their heels in one direction. The lounges in the other. Well a number of better dressed people who had watched a scuffle without taking part in it crowdied in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Agla, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps, but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the streets. Is the poor gentleman much hurt? She asked. Yes, he did. He did. Crud several voices. No, no, there's life in him. Shattered another. But he'll be gone before you can get him the hospital. He's a brave fellow. Said a woman. They would have had the lady's person to watch if it hadn't been for him. They were again and a rough one too. Ah, he's breathing now. He can't lie in the street. May we breathe him in, ma'am? Surely, bring him into the sitting room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please. Slowly and solemnly, he was born into Brian Lodge and laid out in the principal room. While I still observe the proceedings from my post by the window, the lamp said me to let, but the blind said not in drawn. So that I could see homes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction on that moment, for the party was playing. But I know that I never felt more happily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring. Or the grace and kindness with which he waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to homes, to draw back now from the part which he had entrusted to me. I hardened my heart and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another. Homes had sat up upon the couch and I saw him motion like a man who was in need of air. The maid rushed across the thrill of the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cryo. Fire! The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd was spectators. Well dressed and ill. Gentleman, oslas, and servant maid, joined in with a general shriek of... FIRE! Thick clouded a smoke curled through the room and after the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of homes from within, assuring them that it was a falter alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd, I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was a rejoice to fight my friends arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of the at-raw. He walked swiftly and ensignings for some few minutes, until we had turned down with the quiet street, which lead towards the Edwyr Road. You did it very nicely, Doctor. Here in Mark. Nothing could have been better. It is alright. You have the third glass. I know where it is, and how did you find out? She showed me. As I told you she would. I am still in dark. I do not wish to make a mystery. Said he, loving. The matter was perfectly simple. You of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening. I guessed as much. Then, when the round broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face. And became a pittiest spectacle. It is an old trick. That also I could follow. Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on account, try motioned for air. They were compelled to open the window. And you had your chance. How did that help you? It was all important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution scandal, it was of use to me. And also in the Anzworth Castle business, a married woman grabs it her baby, an unmarried one, reaches for her jewel box. Now, it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house, more precious to her than what we are in quest for. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess. Behind a sliding panel, just above the right Belpool, she was there in an instant. And I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glassed at the rocket, rushed from the room. And I have not seen her since. I rose and, making my excuses escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once, but the coachman had come in. And as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-presidence may ruin all. And now, I asked. Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the king tomorrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown it to the sitting room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes, she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands, and when will you call? At eight in the morning, she will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field besides, we must be prompt. For this marriage, may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the king without a delay. We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing a said. Good night, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. There were several people in the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from slim youth in an ulster who had agreed by. I have heard that voice before, said her own. Steering down the din of the rich street. Now, I wonder, would a do-sat could have been? I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of Bohemia rushed into the room. I have really got it! He cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder, and looking equally into his face. Not yet. But you have hopes. I have hopes. Then come, I'm all in patience to be gone. We must have a cab. Now, my brooom is waiting. Then that will simplify matters. We descend in and start it off once more for the brining lodge. Arion Adler is married. In our terms. Nareed? When? Yes today. But to whom? To an English lawyer named Norton. But you could not laugh him. I am in hopes that she does. And why in hopes? Because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your majesty. If she does not love your majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty's plan. It is true, and yet, well, I wish she had been of my own station, what a queen she would have made. He relaxed into a new desilance, which was not broken until we drew up in certain time of a new. The door of brining lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with the side-on-a-kai as we stepped down in the brawling. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe. Setchy. I am Mr. Holmes. Answered in my companion. Looking at her with her questioning, and rather startled gaze. Indeed. My Mr.'s told me that you are likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 515 train from chairing cross for the continent. What? Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with shagarin as a prize. Do you mean that she is left England? Never to return. At the papers? After King, mostly. Oh, it is lost. We shall see. He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing room. Followed by the kingdom myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers. Just a lady had hurriedly ransacked under the vore her fright. Holmes rushed at the vore. Towel back a small sliding shutter, and plodging in his hand. Pulled out the photograph, and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adela herself in evening rest. The letter was super-scribed too. Sherlock Holmes, S.K. To be left till cold for. My friend, Taurus, opened, and we all freered it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way. My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you really did it very well. You took me in completely. And to laughter the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the king employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman, but you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John the coachman to watch you. Ran upstairs, caught into my walking clothes as I called them, and came down just as you departed. Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good night, and started for the temple to see my husband. We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable and antagonist. So you all find the nest empty when you call tomorrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The king may do what he will without hindrance from one room he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess, and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Very truly yours. I remain not an heir. What a woman. Oh, what a woman. Criter King of Bohemia. When we had all free read this episode. Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirer of a queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level? From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed, to be on a very different level to your majesty. Sheath Holmes, co-glee. I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your majesty's business to a more successful conclusion. On the contrary, my dear sir, client the king. Nothing could be more successful. I know that her world is in violet. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire. I am glad to hear your majesty say so. I am immensely indebted to you. Pray. Tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring he slipped and emeralds night ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand. Your majesty has something which I should value even more highly. Said Holmes, you have better name it. This photograph. The king stared at him in an arrangement. Irene's photograph? He cried. Suddenly, if you wish it, I thank your majesty. Then, there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning. He blowed and turned away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him. He set off in my company for his chambers. That was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by women's wit. He used to make Mary over the cleverness of women. But I have not heard him to it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

Or had he gone for good? What's he doing in there? By Fritz Leaver. The professor was congratulating Earth's first visitor from another planet on his wisdom in getting in touch with a cultural anthropologist before contacting any other scientists, or governments God forbid, and in learning English from radio and TV before landing from his orbit parked rocket. When the Martian stood up and said hesitantly, excuse me, please, but where is it? The baffled professor and the Martian seemed to grow anxious. Adlyse his long mouth curved upward, and he had explained earlier that it curled downward was his smile, and he repeated, please, where is it? He was surprisingly humanoid in most respects, but his complexion was textured, so like the rich, dark armchair, he'd just been occupying that the professor's pinstripe gray suit, which he had eagerly consented to wear, seemed an arbitrary interruption between him and the chair. A sort of mother-hubber dress on a phantom conjured from its leather. The professor's wife, always a perceptive hostess, came to her husband's rescue by saying with equal rapidity, top of the stairs, and of the hall last door. The Martian's mouth curled happily downward, and he said, thank you very much, and was off. Comprehension burst on the professor. He caught up with his guest at the foot of the stairs. Here, I'll show you the way he said. No, I can find it myself. Thank you, the Martian assured him. Something rather final in the Martian's tone made the professor disist, and after watching his visitor sway up the stairs, with an almost hypnotic, softly jogging motion. He rejoined his wife in the study, saying wonderingly, who'd have thought it by George? Function taboo's as strict as our own. I'm glad some of your provisorial visitors maintain him, his wife said darkling. But this one's from Mars darling, and to find out he's, well, similar in an aspect of his life, is as thrilling as the discovery that water is burned hydrogen. When I think of the day not far distant, when I'll put his entry in the cross-cultural index. He was still rapsidizing when the professor's little son raced in. Pop, the Martian's gone into bathroom. Hush dear, manners. Now it's perfectly natural darling that the boy should notice and be excited. Yes, son, the Martian's not very different from us. Oh, certainly, the professor's wife said, with a trace of bitterness. I don't imagine his turquoise complexion will cause any comment at all when you bring him to a faculty reception. They'll just figure he's had a hard night, and that he's got that baby elephant nose sniffing around for assisted professorships. Really darling, he probably thinks of our noses as disagreeably amputated and paralyzed. Well, anyway, Pop, he's in the bathroom. I followed him when he squiggle upstairs. Now, son, you shouldn't have done that. He's on a strange planet, and it might make him nervous if he thought it was being spied on. We must show him every courtesy. By George, I can't wait to discuss these things with Akli Ram's bottom. When I think of how much more this encounter has to give an anthropologist than even a physicist or astronomer, he was still going strong on his second rapsity when he was interrupted by another high-speed entrance. It was the professor's cultish daughter. Ma'am, Pop, the Martians, Hushed here, we know. The professor's cultish daughter regained her adolescent poise, which was considerable. Well, he's still in there, she said. I just tried the door and it was locked. I'm glad it was. The professor said, while his wife added, yes, you can't always be sure what, and caught herself. Really dear, that was very bad banners. I thought he'd come downstairs long ago, her daughter explained. He's been in there an awful long time. It must have been a half an hour ago. I saw him gire and gimbal upstairs in that real gone way he has, with Nosey here following him. The professor's cultish daughter was currently soaking up both giv and Alice. When the professor checked his wrist watch, his expression grew troubled. By George, he is taking his time. Though, of course, we don't know how much time Martians, I wonder. I listened for a while, Pop, the sun volunteered. He was running the water, a lot. Running water, A, we know Mars is a water-starve planet. I suppose that in the presence of unlimited water, he may be seized by a kind of madness. And, but he seems so well adjusted. Then his wife spoke, voicing all their thoughts. Her outlook on life gave her a natural settler-car voice. What's he doing in there? Twenty minutes, and at least as many frantic suggestions later, the professor glanced again at his watch, and nerved himself for action. Motioning his family aside, he mounted the stairs and tipped-oed down the hall. He paused only once to shake his head and mud around her his breath. By George, I wish I had fin-church or von Gottchock here, there a shade better than I am on intercultural contracts, especially Taboo Breaky and a front. His family followed him in a short distance. The professor stopped in front of the bathroom door. Everything was quiet as death. He listened for a minute, then wrapped measuredly, steadying his hand by clutching its wrist with the other. There was a faint splashing, but no other sound. Another minute passed, the professor wrapped again. Now there was no response at all. He very gingerly tried the knob. The door was still locked. When they had all recreated to the stairs, it was a professor's wife, who once more voiced their thoughts. This time her voice carried overtones of supernatural horror. What's he doing in there? He may be dead or dying. The professor's cultish daughter suggested, bristly. Maybe we ought to call a fire department, like they did for old Miss Frisbee. The professor wenced. I'm afraid you haven't visualized the complications dear, he said gently. No one but ourselves knows that the Martian is on earth, or has even the slightest inkling that interplanetary travel has been achieved. Whatever we do, it will have to be on our own. But to break in on a creature engaged in, well, we don't know what primal private activity is against all anthropological practice. Still, dying's a primal activity is daughter said crisply. So is ritual bathing before mass murder, his wife had it? Please, still, as I was about to say, we do have the moral duty to sucker him, if, as you all too reasonably suggest, he has been incapacitated by a germ or virus, or more likely by some simple environmental factor, such as earth's greater gravity. Tell you what, pop, I can look in the bathroom window and see what he's doing. All I have to do is crawl out my bedroom window and along the gutter a little ways. It's safe as houses. The professor's question beginning with, son, how do you know? died unuttered, and he refused to notice the words his daughter was voicing silently at her brother. He glanced at his wife's sargonically composed face, thought once more of the fire department, or of the other and larger and even more jealous, or would it be skeptical, government agencies, and clutched at the straw offered him. 10 minutes later, he was quite unnecessarily assisting his son back through the bedroom window. She, pop, I can't see a sign of him. That's why I took so long. Hey, pop, don't look so scared. He's in there, sure enough. It's just that the bath thubs under the window and you have to get real close to see into it. The Martians taking a bath? Yep, got it full up and just the end of his little old shnows sticking out. Your suit pop was hanging on the door. The one word the professor's wife spoke was like a deathnell. Drowned. No, why don't think so? His shnows was opening and closing regularly like. Maybe he's a shape changer. The professor's cultist daughter said in a burst of evil fantasy. Maybe he softens in the water and thins out after a while until he's like an eel, and then he'll go exploring through the sewer pipes. Wouldn't it be funny if he went under the street and knocked on the stopper from underneath and crawled into the bathtub of President Rexford, or Mrs. President Rexford, or maybe right in the middle of one of Jani Rexford's, oh, I'm so sexy, bubble bass? Please, the professor put his hand to his eyebrow and kept it there, cuddling the elbow in the other hand. Well, have you thought of something? The professor's wife asked him after a bit. What are you going to do? The professor dropped his hand and blanked his eyes hard and took a deep breath. Telegraph Finchurch and Acle Ram's bottom and then break in. He said in a resigned voice, into which nevertheless a note of hope seemed to have come. First, however, I'm going to wait until morning. And he sat down cross-legged in the hall a few yards from the bathroom door and folded his arms. So, the long vigil commenced. The professor's family shared it and he offered no objection. Other, sterner man, he told himself, might claim to be able successfully to order their children to go to bed when there was a Martian locked in the bathroom, but he would like to see them faced with the situation. Finally, dawn began to see from the bedrooms. When the bulb in the hall had grown quite dim, the professor unfolded his arms. Just then, there was a loud splashing in the bathroom. The professor's family looked toward the door. The splashing stopped and they heard the Martian moving around. Then the door opened and the Martian appeared in the professor's grave pinstripe suit. His mouth curled sharply downward in a broad alien smile as he saw the professor. Good morning, the Martian said happily, I never slept better in my life, even in my own little wet bed back on Mars. He looked around more closely and his mouth straightened. But where did you all sleep? He asked, Don't tell me you stayed dry all night. You didn't give up your only bed for me. His mouth curled upward in misery. Oh dear, he said. I'm afraid I've made a mistake somehow. Yet I don't understand how. Before I studied you, I didn't know what your sleeping habits would be. But the question was answered for me. In fact, it looked so reassuringly home-like when I saw those brief TV scenes of your females ready to sleep in their little tubs. Of course on Mars, only the fortunate can always be sure of sleeping wet. But here, with your abundance of water, I thought there would be wet beds for all. He paused. It's true I had some doubts last night, wondering if I'd use the right words at all. But then, when you wrapped good night to me, I splashed the sentiment back to you and went to sleep in a wink. But I'm afraid that somewhere I've blundered and... No, no, dear chap, the professor managed to say. He had been waving his hand in a gentle circle for some time in token that he wanted to interrupt. Everything is quite all right. It's true we stayed up all night, but please consider that as a watch, an honor guard by George, which we kept to indicate our esteem. The end of, what's he doing in there? Bye for its labor.","Science Fiction, Fantasy Fiction, Anthologies",English,09:36:06,LibriVox Volunteers,"['Martians', 'Martian']","['Rexford', 'von Gottchock', 'Hushed', 'Dale Groffman', 'Nosey', 'Alice', ""Jani Rexford's"", 'Fritz Leaver', 'Frisbee', 'George']",[],"['Mars', 'earth', 'Earth']",0,0,0,0,5,1,1

He took a long time for human beings to accept that our little piece of media work rubble wasn't the exact and absolute center of the universe. It does appear that way, doesn't it? He it may not take so long for a spaceman to learn. Ego Centric orbit by John Cori. Near the end of his 15th orbit, as Greenland slipped by noiselessly below, he made the routine measurements that tested the operation of his space capsule and checked the automatic instruments, which would transmit their stored data to Earth on his next pass over control. Everything was normal. All mechanical devices were operating perfectly. The information didn't surprise him, in fact, he really didn't even think about it. The previous orbits and the long simulated flights on Earth during training had made such checks routine and perfect results expected. The capsules were developed by exhaustive testing both on the ground and as empty satellites before entrusting them to carry animals and then the first human. He returned to contemplation of the panorama passing below and above, although as he noted idly, above and below had lost some of their usual meaning. Since his capsule, like all heavenly bodies, was stable in position with respect to the entire universe and thanks to Sir Isaac Newton and his laws, never changed. The Earth and stars alternated over his head during each orbit. Up, now meant whatever was in the direction of his head. He remembered that during his initial orbit, when the Earth first appeared overhead, he accepted the fact as normal. He wondered if the other two had accepted it as easily, for there had been two men herald into orbit before his venture into space. Two others, who had also passed the rigorous three-year training period and were selected on the basis of overall performance to proceed him. He had known them both well and wondered again what had happened on their flights. Of course they had both returned, depending on what short definition of return was. The capsules in which they had ventured beyond Earth had returned them living. But this was to be expected, for even the considerable hazards of dissent through the atmosphere and the terrible heating which occurred were successfully surmounted by the capsule. Naturally, it had not been expected that the satellites would have to be brought down by command from the ground. But this, too, was part of the careful planning, radio control of the retro rockets that moved the satellite out of orbit by reducing its velocity. Of course, ground control was to be used only if the astronaut failed to ignite the retro rockets himself. He remembered everyone's surprise and relief when the first capsule was recovered and its occupant found to be alive. They had assumed that in spite of all precautions he was dead because he had not fired the rockets on the 15th orbit, and it was necessary to bring him down on the 65th. Recovery alive only partially solved the mystery, for the rescuers and all others were met by a hotty, stony silence from the occupant. Batteries of tests confirmed and early diagnosis, complete and utter withdrawal. Absolute refusal to communicate. Therapy was unsuccessful. The second attempt was similar in most respects. Except that command returned was made on the 31st orbit after the astronaut's failure to de-orbit at the end of the 13th. His incoherent babbling of moons, stars and worlds was no more helpful than the first. Test after test confirmed that no obvious organic damage had been incurred by exposure outside of the Earth's protective atmosphere. Biopsies of even selected brain tissues seem to show that microscopic cellular changes due to prolonged weightlessness or primary cosmic ray bombardment, which had been suggested by some authorities, were unimportant. Some what reluctantly it was decided to repeat the experiment a third time. The launching was un-eventful. He was sent into space with the precision he expected. The experience was exhilarating, and although he had anticipated every event at advance, he could not possibly have foreseen the overpowering feeling that came over him. Weightlessness, he had experienced for brief periods during training, but nothing could match the heavy impression of continuous freedom from gravity. The Earth, passing overhead, was also to be expected from the simple laws of celestial mechanics, but his feeling as he watched it now was inexpressible. It occurred to him that perhaps this was indeed why he was here, because he could appreciate such experiences best. He had been told the stars would be bright, un-blinking, and an infinitude in extent, but could mere descriptions or photographs convey the true seeing? On his 21st orbit he completed his overseeing the entire surface of the planet in daylight. He had seen more of Earth than anyone able to tell about it, but only he had the true feeling of it. The continents were clearly visible as were the oceans and both polar ice caps. The shapes were familiar, but only in a remote way. A vague indistinctiveness, born of distance, served to modify the outlines, and he alone was seeing and understanding. On the dark side of the planet, large cities were marked by indistinct light areas, which pale to insignificance compared to the stars and his son. He speculated about the others who had only briefly experienced these sights. Undoubtedly, they weren't as capable of fully grasping or appreciating any of these things as he was. It was quite clear that no one else but he could encompass the towering feeling of power and importance generated by being alone in the universe. At the end of the 25th orbit, he disabled the radio control of the retrorockets, and sat back with satisfaction to await the next circuit of his Earth around him. The end of, he goes centric orbit by John Cori.","Science Fiction, Fantasy Fiction",English,06:46:49,LibriVox Volunteers,[],"['John Cori', 'Dale Growthman', 'Isaac Newton']",[],['Earth'],0,0,0,0,2,0,0
The Brothers Karamazov (version 3),Fyodor Dostoyevsky,122163,17.0,"February 21, 2020",[],0,"revox.org, recording by Bruce Peary. The Brevis Karamazov, by Fjodor Dostevsky, translated by Constance Garnett. Book 1, The History of a Family, Chapter 1, Fjodor Pavlovich Karamazov. Alexei Fjodor Vich Karamazov was the third son of Fjodor Pavlovich Karamazov. A landowner will known in our district in his own day and still remembered among us, owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened 13 years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place. For the present, I will only say that this landowner, for so we used to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate, was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type, abject, and vicious, and at the same time senseless. But he was one of those senseless persons who are very well-capable of looking after their worldly affairs, and apparently after nothing else. Fjodor Pavlovich, for instance, began with next to nothing, his estate was of the smallest. He ran to dying at other men's tables and fastened on them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand rubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district. A repeat, it was not stupidity, the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough, but just senselessness and a peculiar national form of it. He was married twice and had three sons, the eldest, the metry, by his first wife, and two, Iván and Alexei, by his second. Fjodor Pavlovich's first wife, Adaliya Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district, the Miusats. How it came to pass that an eras who was also a beauty and more over one of those vigorous, intelligent girls so common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless puny weakling, as we all called him, I won't attempt to explain. I knew a young lady of the last romantic generation who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a gentleman whom she might quite easily have married at any moment, invented insupurable obstacles to their union and ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to satisfy her own caprice and to be like Shakespeare's Ophelia. Indeed, if this precipice a chosen and favorite spot of hers had been less picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most likely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, and probably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or three generations. And then I eat the Ivanovna Miusats action was similarly, no doubt, an echo of other people's ideas and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show her feminine independence to override class distinctions and the despotism of her family, and a pliable imagination persuaded her we must suppose for a brief moment that Fjodor Pavlovich, in spite of his parasitic position, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch, though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more. What gave the marriage Pekanci was that it was preceded by an illopement, and this greatly captivated Adelaide Ivanovna's fancy. Fjodor Pavlovich's position at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another, to attach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect. As for mutual love, it did not exist, apparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite of Adelaide Ivanovna's beauty. This was perhaps a unique case of the kind in the life of Fjodor Pavlovich, who was always of a voluptuous temper and ready to run after any petticoat on the slightest encouragement. She seems to have been the only woman who made no particular appeal to his senses. Immediately after the allopement Adelaide Ivanovna discerned in a flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity. Although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between them. It was said that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than Fjodor Pavlovich, who, as is now known, got hold of all her money up to 25,000 rubles as soon as she received it so that those thousands were lost to her forever. The little village and the rather fine townhouse which formed part of her dowry, he did his utmost for a long time to transfer to his name by means of some deed of conveyance. He would probably have succeeded merely from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him and from the contempt and loving he aroused by his persistent and shameless opportunity. But fortunately Adelaide Ivanovna's family intervened and circumvented his greediness. It is known for a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife, but rumor had it that Fjodor Pavlovich did not beat his wife but was beaten by her. For she was a hot tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally, she left the house and ran away from Fjodor Pavlovich with a destitute divinity student, leaving Mitsha, a child of three years old, in her husband's hands. Immediately, Fjodor Pavlovich introduced a regular heron into the house and abandoned himself to orgy's of drunkenness. In the intervals he used to drive all over the province complaining tearfully to each and all of Adelaide Ivanovna's having left him, going into details to disgraceful for a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed to gratify him and flatter his self-love most was to play the ridiculous part of the injured husband and to parade his woes with the embellishments. One would think that you'd got a promotion Fjodor Pavlovich, you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow, scoffers said to him. Many even added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon, and that it was simply to make it funny here that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position. But who knows, it may have been simplicity. At last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife, the poor woman turned out to be in Petersburg where she had gone with her divinity student and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation. Fjodor Pavlovich had once began bustling about, making preparations to go to Petersburg with what object he could not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone, but having determined to do so, he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another boat of reckless drinking. And just at that time, his wife's family received the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly in a garot according to one story of Tafis, or has another version had it of starvation. Fjodor Pavlovich was drunk when he heard of his wife's death, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands to heaven. Lord now let his thou thy servant depart in peace. But others said he wept without restraint, like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him in spite of the repulsion he inspired. He is quite possible that both fusions were true, that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her who released him. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose, and we ourselves are two.

Elementary and High Chain Exituation of the Yuv. The Long War and more than the War, the consequences of the Great Strager had a penituous influence on the elementary and sanitary conditions of the Yuv. The children having been reared during the war are, generally speaking, visibly deficient in bodily strength, torness and weight. Re-cats have enormously increased and materially contributed to the rise of the juvenile death rate. The Austrian Yuvs have been in recent times of next-amined by medical men in the course of the general works of charity, especially in view of the distribution of meals and the returns of these inspections have been minimally registered. The sensors of nursing mothers and succumbing babies is entrusted to the maternity of the business. This cool boys and girls have been repeatedly examined by their official school physicians, responsible for the medical supervision of public schools, as well as by physicians appointed by private charity institutions and by physicians in the service of the numerous foreign organizations for Austrian help. The children of a 14 of age have been examined in the highest cruise and art and craft schools, by the physicians of the education and staff, many of these juveniles also by physicians in foreign services. The mothers not being able to buy artificial or ready-made foodstuffs nurse the babies at the breast as long as possible, six months, nine or twelve months. The sanitary conditions of these babies is therefore quite satisfactory, but the sanitary condition of the little children from one to six years of age is extremely bad. Almost everything wanting or being too expensive such a child is in need of after the succumbing period. In the open country, conditions are somewhat better, but much the rose in industrial centers above all in Vienna. In spite of the humanitarian work of the society of friends, for the rescue of little children, the returns of the medical examinations made in the beginning of the winter 1920 were most unsatisfactory. 85,000 boys and girls were examined. 10% only were returned in the class good, 90% as shattered in the physical strength. 18% of those boys and girls were returned as sick, thereof 5% suffering from chronic diseases condemned to a lifelong sickness. Also the dwellings of those ill-fad children were visited. 42% of these dwellings are unfit, dark, ill-arrated, damp, or crowded. 47% sterov, not containing birth accommodation for the children. The number of underfed boys and girls is as equally high in the so-called middle classes, living on fixed salaries or occupied in free locations as in the industrial working classes. Even in the classes of commercial and industrial employers, the elementary conditions are not much better. Out of 50,000 children of less of six years of age on the medical inspection, 33% suffer from ricats, 4% from anemia. The comparatively small figures of two creoses is due to the fact that only ambulance children were returned. Children in bad, not being included in the census. Detailed particulars have been obtained for the elementary conditions of the Vienna School-Going-Use, from six to 14 years of age. About 130,000 girls and boys have been examined in Vienna, 90,000 in lower Austria. In spite of the inefficient help from foreign countries, the alimentation of these class of youth is highly deficient. Only 28% of all these boys and girls were classified as good and middling, 72% as bad and very bad. The beneficial influence of foreign help is clearly shown by the fact that girls largely favored by foreign families and other benefactors and staying much longer time in foreign countries have a comparatively very large share in the good and middling classification. 44% of all boys on the medical inspection were returned as very bad. Against 38% of girls, the classification bad was returned for 33% of boys and 28% of girls, good for 7% of boys and 4% of girls. About 85,000, extra-mind school boys and girls were returned very bad. 65,000 bad against 20,000, 10% good. The classification had been established on the basis of exhaustive and miniat measurements and weighing. Medical assistance for the youth. The unhappy state of things appealed to an effective organization of official elementary and medical help for the children. An exhaustive scheme for assistance was drafted the existing charitable organizations incorporated in the official work and the private institutions largely provided by the state with rictures, fool and money in the measure of available means. In several larger towns, children's assistance boards were founded in all provinces a provincial children's assistance board is working. In Vienna, the works of private charity are amagmated in true great corporations, the League of voluntary children's assistance and the caritas. The Supreme Board for all matters concerning infantile and children's assistance is incorporated in the ministry for social administration. The inland children's assistance is divided in the following branches. First, food hub for nursing mothers and sucking babies, second, assistance for homes, asylum and similar institutions for abnormal, crippled, tuberculosis and rickety children, third, distribution of meals for children, monetary assistance for working expenditure, fourth, holiday organizations, fifth, collecting office. All nursing mothers and sucking babies are officially entitled to receive state subsidies. The number of babies assisted by the subsidies in form of food stuff were 194,000 and 34, only in towns and industrial centers but excluding Vienna. Austria enjoys a very large number of private institutions of every description for assistance to children. In the first instance, the orphanages of Venezilems and homes are to be mentioned, numbering in all 120. Furthermore, 50 educational institutions and about 80 infant homes and asylum. For sucking babies and little children, about 200 crutches and children's homes, the same number of kindergarten, 200 daytime shelters, for school children, 20 aprentices home and 100 evening homes for girls and boys employed in industrial or commercial work. A certain number of holiday institutions, especially for children engaged in business, have print transformed lately in standing country homes. This most beneficial progress was obtainable only by the means of foreign help. Also disabled and crippled children are provided for by some death dump and blind children's homes. Lately also by the foundation of a kindergarten and a home for death dump blind children. The sanatorium for tuberculosis children in Vienna, called Binerin Amkroyd, 400 beds has enjoyed the special care of private benefactors. Thanks to the magnificence of the Swedish red gross, this institution has lately very effigyly developed its activity. In order to institution, virtually a daytime home for 102 crutches children yield at similar good resides, also thanks to foreign help, society of friends, legal for american and of Danish women. In the same manner, there is a material of grimindstein, 400 beds for children, suffering from tuberculosis or styromanlaxia is kept in working order by the Swedish red gross. The Vienna school children have been afforded with a holiday stay in the country. With the help of the use assistance board and private charity, most of them were enabled to search around six or eight weeks in a holiday colony or special homes. A considerate number of children were sheltered by farmers against the slight allowance. In all, about 50,000 Viennese children spent a holiday in Austria. A grismas collection organized by the Minister of Social Administration and devoted to the assistance of the youth had yielded many millions of cronin. A similar enterprise made by the society of friends had also resided in a very large sum of money. In spite of all these exertions, neither the assistance of the state and the municipality of Vienna nor private charity can possibly triumph over the steadily increasing misery in this battle to provide the strictness of the amount of food and to rescue the youth from sickness and death. But the early socura from abroad, beginning already in autumn 1918, and concentrating all its efforts to the salvation of the youth was the greatest blessing in this terrible struggle. The effectual work of the foreign committees and favour of the Austrian institutions of assistance for the youth is divided as follows. First, help for the tree's cool age. Second, help for schoolboys and girls by sending them in foreign country during the holidays. By distribution of meals, clothes, linen, food gear and wikstress. The two last named actions extends to help also to juvenise. Succing babies and little children, till six years of age, are under the special care of the society of friends whose actions had begun with the guidance of the director of the state maternity office and extended its beneficial influence in ever increasing proportions. The sensors of suckling babies and little children is carried through by the maternity of physicists, having been in existence before the breakdown of the empire and multiplied since. The total number of such offices stand now at about 350, thereof in Vienna 42, in lower Austria without Vienna 173. This acclaimed babies, since lately also the little children, await ones in every week in the maternity of physicists, are maintained under careful medical control and are provided against a little contribution by the parents with certain foodstuffs in this pensable for the rearing of a baby, each he grotes cocoa, preserved milk, or fresh milk, only for six babies. There, the babies are also provided with babies' liners and clothes. The British Vienna emergency relief fund had aimed especially the reform of the boarding system for children. To this effect, a large sum of money had been delivered by this fund to grant the boarding persons higher allowances for the pupils. Hospital's habitually sensed a comalest than children in boarding houses in the countering order to have at the command any available bed for children, mounting immediate medical assistance. But perhaps the most touching example of international solidarity in this dress and calamity is the widespread action of boarding Austrian children in foreign countries. During 1919, about 40,000 Austrian children and tried foreign hospitality. In the first place, it was Switzerland, having sheltered, fared and clothed more than 20,000 children. Holland, with almost 10,000, all the countries as Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Italy with the rest. During 1920, this work of charity developed enormously. In January, February and July, about 90,000 Austrian children stayed in foreign countries. Total number till today, 124,000. Almost all of them in families. Switzerland and Holland go ahead also in 1920, followed by Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Italy, Spain and Romania, Transylvania, finally England, Belgium and France. The average duration of a child's day in foreign country was about 3 months, but in many cases, especially in Sweden, Norway and England, much longer, 6 to 12 months. Many children are urgently invited to return in next year. The recently dispatched railway trains contained many children going for the second time to the fosters. Quite recently, also little children, on the 6 years of age, are sent in foreign countries, and many orphans have been adopted there. In the average, after a day of two months abroad, a sensible increase in weight has been a certain. The average increase for such a time is about 3 to 4 kilograms, in certain cases till 5 and 6 kilograms. After a day of 4 to 5 months, certain children had gained 10 to 16 kilograms in weight, but all return home, bodily and mentally restored and invigorated. A great number for infosterous, either habit of sending regularly food supplies to the departed darlings, or remit them, money orders, enabling them to buy the necessary victims. Many of the children are coming back, which leave provided with lining and clothes, others are helped by parcels of such articles, regularly sent to them. Not only these atonthage children, but many others are provided with weak trills, shoes and clothes by foreign charitable institutions. Above all, the society of friends under the leadership of Dr. Clark must be mentioned. They take care of the first instance for pregnant and nursing women for succumbing babies and little children. In the second line, this is Comiti, the Danish women's ring and St. American Help for Children. Their dollar parcels containing victories of the St. American Help are distributed to hospital's asylum, convalesced symptoms and similar charitable institutions. An honour work, the St. American Help, the St. American Help, has been organized by British initiative. At Christmas, the foreign works distributed large quantities of clothes, shoes and wick trills. Quite recently, the foreign help had shaped in the form of assuming the management of a certain given Austrian institution, exhausted of all monetary means due to the general impoverishment. In this manner, this Swedish Red Cross manages the Vienna Hospital for two recluse children, spinnerin' on Kreuz. The Dutch Children's Committee, the home at Snorlingbach for two-an-a-girls, and during the summer holidays, the students' home at Sanctuary, Fulfconsee. The Dutch Swiss-Dings Committee maintains in Vienna and the goalers' door of a children's home. A New York-Charm and American Committee for help manages the Conglesstance Home for rickety children at Tivoli, New Vienna. Another New York Committee, Vienna Milk Relief, inaugurated slightly a home in the barracks of the Vahospital Rinsing in Vienna. The schoolboys and girls suffering doubly, being ill-fied and therefore improper to fulfill the claims of the schools has been particularly helped by the distribution of meals organized by the American Hub for Children. This magnificent action, in inaugurated two years ago in the then existing popular kitchens in Vienna, had been extended in such a manner as to distribute now 300,000 deliberations representing a monetary value of 4,500,000 crore on this figure, 151,000 donations are distributed in Vienna, 45,000 in lower Austria, 14,000 in Salzburg, 12,000 in Tirol, 5,000 in Vorarberg, 36,000 in Sturia, and 11,000 in Carinfer. Also, apprentices in Vienna almost 14,000 donations are now included in this work. This election is operated by an exhaustive medical examination, only underfed or suffering children, entitled to enjoy the distributions. Swedish Norwegian and Dutch works are concerned in the distribution of meals for about 20,000 true in ice.

Is an ancient but fine and well-preserved structure of the old homestead type. There is a porch. Windows with fines. Plants etc. Across back of stage a fence with open gate centre. At left the small arbor or summer house on the edge of an orchard. A back. A road leading to right and left. Beyond fence and on flat. The glimpse of rolling fields. A church spire. And the roofs of a few houses scattered in the distance. It is the afternoon of a day in the latter part of August. At rise, Aaron Flint is heard whistling of left up rentions. Mrs. Brewster is discovered in Hamakorchia in Arbor left the sleep, her book fallen to the ground. Enter Aaron Flint left up rentions beyond fence to gate centre. Almost at same moment, Liliana appears on porch of house. Aaron carries several letters sealed, addressed and stamped. A newspaper or two and a good-sized, passels-post package of books addressed. Liliana comes down to right centre. That the mail-air and let's see. Why a lot, ain't they? She takes letters from him. She's say they was. Most old from Mrs. Brewster though, and a letter for her daughter. Seems to me, ain't nothing but them around here one way or another. I wonder how much longer they can stay. Lian, I don't know. Looks like we've got him sat alone to us for life. Ben here since June and here, Tee's most September. She is closely inspecting the letters. Tee's a wonder to me, Miss Newcome don't get tired of boarding them for nothing, and having them putting on such ears and all, even if they are our own sister in niece. All fired cheeky, I call it. Well, you know her. Easy as all get out. Guess I'm the one to do most of the kick-in when you come right down to it. All the extra work they make with coffee took up to their rooms at nine in the morning. Lunchin as they call it about half past one. And dinner, full meal, Maja. It's seven at night when it's most time for sensible folks to be going a bed. Keeps me up all airs. I must say I'm getting pretty tired of it. I guess you'd be in no wonder. But as she say Miss Newcome's that easy she wouldn't say a word, even if they stay till kingdom come. If there ever was a saint on earth, she's won. Well, even saints get imposed on, but I suppose be in saints. It's up to them not to find any fault. Even when it's rubbed in. From out part, I think even a saint all to have a little gumption. That's more books for her. Yep. Some more of them sure a lot comes. Detecative stories she's always reading, I reckon. Must be four or five here from the heft of the bundle. Well, it beats all the amount of that trash she does read. Them terrible yarns all about murders and mysteries. Lann, I should think she'd be so full of murder clues in everything. She couldn't sleep nights. They'd give me the creeps if I was to read him the way she does. Oh, I don't know. I sort of like a myself. Miss Newcome let me a few and they certainly are homers. I sure would like to be one of them detectives they tell about with all the excitement they have tracing up murderers and such. Yeah, it's a pretty detective you'd make. You better be getting along detect in a few chores instead of standing here talking murder clues. Here, I'll take that bundle in the house with these letters. She takes package. They do not notice Mrs. Brusta who is still asleep. Aaron gets closer to Lillian, making up to her. She seems unconscious of his intention about to go to porch. He detains her. Say, Lillian, what you do after supper? Well, she dishes, I suppose, as usual. Dinner, I guess you mean, though, and a pile of dishes it makes, too, makes me sick. Say, Lillian, if I'm a weapon, then Lillian will take a walk. Well, Lillian, I feel more like walking a bed than anywhere else once I get through. What do I want to take a walk for? Well, I thought maybe you and me just go for a little stroll if you like. See, and as it's moonlight, and all, any rain looks like it's going to be a long-saving night. I declare Aaron Flint, you're old enough to have more sense. Getting sentimental at your age. How many times have I told you? Hmm, why are you all the old saying? Then the lobsters loves best. So I guess it ain't too late for you and me. He attempts to kiss her. She gives them a playful slap and starts to go up steps. Mrs. Brewster wakes up and sees them. They pause, turning as she speaks. Mrs. Brewster, rising, coming towards center. Perhaps when you have finished your most unbecoming behavior, you will inform me whether any of those letters are for me. Aaron, was an awkward bar of apology. Yes, ma'am. Several are done. Lillian, looking over letters, quite unperturbed. I guess some of these are for you if your name's Ms. Brewster. Holds out letters. Exeteran, left up Rexett. Mrs. Brewster, as she takes letters. Thanks. They look mostly like Bill's name seems to me. You are entirely too familiar for a servant. I shall speak to my sister about it. I ain't afraid of anything you'll say to Ms. Newcoma that me. I guess I ain't lived with her the past 14 years without her knowing me well enough to not let anything you could say count, even if you are her own sister. And from the city. I should think the way you've been staying here all summer, you and your daughter, and been waited on and everything without paying a scent for it, that you wouldn't have so very much to say. That's my opinion. Thought was to express it. Lillian is on porch in a half. Mrs. Brewster has crossed back to left near seat. Almost over come by her in-vignation. Ah! This is more than I can be expected to stand. Well, then you can sit down to it. There's a seat right behind you. Mrs. Brewster sinks into chair apparently about to faint. Lillian disdains her. Enter right up her entrance. Helen Brewster and Leonard Philmore. She carries a parasol and a bunch of wild flowers. Leonard stays up by gate. Helen, coming down. Why mother, what's the matter? Are you ill? Ghost Mrs. Brewster. I have been insulted by that person there. Indicating Lillian. Leonard looks at Lillian with a knowing smile. Lillian, I heard her any. Just saying a few things to ease my mind. I guess she'll live through it. Exit Lillian to house with a toss of her head and an in-bignance sniff. Leonard Philmore, coming down to right center. You mustn't take Lillian too seriously, Mrs. Brewster. She's a privileged character around here again now. I should say she is. It's insufferable the way my sister permits at woman to dumb in the ear and make herself so offensive. I shall have her dismissed. Hmm. Well, I'm inclined to think even you couldn't have that done, Mrs. Brewster. I'm sorry if she's been rude and I'll speak to Miss Nukem about it, but... Well, I imagine it would be about as easy to dismiss the pump or the barn as Lillian. The farm wouldn't be complete without her. Mrs. Brewster, changing the subject. Helen, I should like to know where you have been all this time. We have been for a stroll, Mr. Philmore and I, are any of those letters for me. One. I am afraid it was largely my fault. I believe I am vagled Miss Brewster into walking rather farther than she otherwise would have done. Indeed. The persuasive powers of a promising young legal light. How interesting. Helen, smiling. Mother, promising. He has already quite arrived, you know. He was telling me of one of his cases, what was it, Mr. Philmore? Defending a Yokell who's cow is accused of infringing upon another man's property and destroying some cabbages? Yes, quite as important as that. I think I should win my case too, after a hard judicial struggle. And when I do, I shall come and claim your congratulations. But, steps. Now, if you will excuse me, I will look for Miss Nukem. I have a little business to transact, and at the same time I will speak to her about the offending Lillian. Exit Leonard to Heiss, will the show of good nature dignity? Helen, I believe he was half-laff in it us. Helen, who is reading her letter? No doubt. Mrs. Brewster, again seated, left. And I should like to know what you mean by such a show of intimacy with him. A mere country lawyer, taking a stroll with him and... Oh, well, one has to have a little amusement in this forsaken place. Do let me entertain myself in some way. Besides, look what a reward I reaped. This beautiful bouquet. Quots flowers and Mrs. Brewster's love. Mrs. Brewster, throwing flowers to grand. And what of me? I hope you don't think I stay here from choice. Surely it is better than shedding ourselves up in the city, or going to some cheap boarding house, as we would have had to do. You know, by our harbor, a new port were quite out of the question, look at these. Pills, bills, bills, threats, lawsuits. We did not go back to New York for fear of our creditors. I don't know what is to become of us. We can't stay and live on Aunt Sarah much longer, that's certain. It is becoming unbearable. If only we could have kept up appearances one more season, you might have... Well, something might have turned up. Helen, she has gone up by gate. No, comes down. I suppose you mean I might have sold myself, or you might have sold me. Why not say it? I am in the market for the highest bitter. Even you are not beyond possibilities. Helen, how can you say such things to me your own mother? I'm sure I have enough to bear without that. I guess I am about as desperate as you are for it seems to be up to me. I...I don't know why you need to put it in that vulgar way, but as you say we cannot stay here much longer. Look at these. Showing bills. If we go back to New York, there's Dick. If only he could do something. Dick, you know how much good he is to me. I did hope when he secured that position in the bank at $40 a week, that he might at least cease to be a worry to me. But no. Nevertheless, he is still your son and my brother. Much good such a son is to me. I have practically disowned him. You know it is nearly a year since we have even seen him. No, we must think of something more reliable than Dick, my dear. Now there was... Mr. Deering? Yes, one of the likely bitters. Well, if it will be any satisfaction to you, this letter is from him. Helen! And does he? Yes, mother, I believe you really have a chance to sell me at a very good price. Helen! Are you used to listen to such talk? You know he is a gentleman. He is worth millions. You should consider yourself a very lucky girl. I suppose I am so far as your idea of luck is concerned. But that man, old, gross, the very thought of him, repels me. When Mr. Deering isn't that more than 45? Well, or 8 or 9, perhaps. I think of all you could command as his wife. But the question is, that present? How will we to manage to get back to New York, pay our bills, and keep up appearances until it can be brought about? I know just one way. My sister. What? And Sarah, that simple, country-fied old maid? Pray what could she do? She could help us out of our difficulties if she would. You may not know it, my dear, but Sarah no come as rich. At least she must have a great deal of money. When our father died, Sarah and I came in for everything he had. He had run this farm for many years, and his father had before him, and had made money which he invested and increased. When he made his will, I chose cash, and in time received $10,000. Sarah kept the farm as her share, and as rusticated here ever since. Well, I, well, I went to the city, met your father, married him, and ended up on the life that appealed to me. Your father's death left me well-provided for, but... Oh, well, it has vanished. Well, Sarah, her money must have accumulated and increased. So you see my dear, she is rich. Well, I must say, it is the last thing I ever would have thought of, but even so, do you think you could manage it or her? It would have to be carefully done, of course. By the way, that Mr. Filmores are legal advisor, I believe. He has charge of all her affairs. He'd know just how much she is worth, and she would accept his advice. Hmm. Perhaps after all, you'd better be a bit nice to him. You want me to pump him to exert an insidious influence, as it were. Oh, very well, leave it to me. He's rather too nice to fellow to be made a fool of, even if I can do it. But, as you say, something must be done, anything is better than the poor house and oblivion. And in the meantime, don't forget that it would be good policy to keep on the right side of all these people. To make his good and impression as possible. Oh, yes, we may as well begin to do the thing upright, even if it is rather late in the day. Hell, Anne! Sometimes you shock me by your absolute vulgarity. Please do not use such expressions. We shall do nothing dishonorable. I hope not, but I must say the very idea is repellent to me. I wish it were well over. Enter Lillian from house to porch, her hands rolled up in apron. Say, Miss Nucum wants to know what you think you'd like to have for supper. Her dinner, I suppose you call it. It's very kind of you to consult us, isn't it, Helen? Can you think of anything you should like to have, dear? Well, of course, this ain't no first class hotel, we ain't got everything. I'm sure anything and Sarah is kind enough to provide will be most acceptable. Yes, of course. And you're getting muddy, unpredictable, all of a sudden seems to me. Well, how would a good bald dinner do you? I'm afraid I don't know just what you mean. I guess you know what a bald dinner is all right. You still live here on the farm yourself till you went away to board in school and got in with city folks in their high notions. I guess you've it boiled dinners before now. Indeed. But I never lived on the farm you know, Lillian. So perhaps you will inform me just what a boiled dinner is. Something boiled, of course. Sure. Cabbage turnips, potatoes and so forth, boiled in with a nice hunk of salt pork, part lean. Hmm, it just touches a spot with us, but well, Miss Nucumint let me have one all summer, thinking it wouldn't be stylish enough for you. But I guess you'd manage to eat it. I am sure it sounds quite a luring. Well, it sounds good and filling any hell. Squash Pag goes fine with it, and as I said to Miss Nucum, if they don't like it, let him go with out. Tennie rates what we're going to have because I got it over. Miss is Brewster as if unable to control herself has gone up by gate is looking off left. Helen shrugs her shoulders good naturedly. Lillian goes to the door meeting Leonard, who enters from house. He passes her and comes down to right center. Exit Lillian to house. Leonard, looking back at Lillian. I hope she hasn't been letting out again. I tried to get here in time to water off, but was talking to Miss Nucum. We have been ordering our dinner. That's all. It's to be a boiled one. Quite a feast, I believe. Yes, indeed. You have a treat in store. One of Lillian's boiled dinners and squash pie for dessert, I hope. Yes, I believe that is to be a part of the banquet. Going pot-way up center. Mother, aren't you going to take a little nap in preparation for such a gastronomical? Smiling to Leonard. Is that a good word? Feast? No, I napped quite sufficiently this afternoon. While you and Mr. Film are weird, taking a stroll and picking wildflowers, I believe. Leonard has crossed the left. Notice is the flowers on ground. The plants are rather rufly at them. I wish to go in and see Miss Nucum. If you can spare me for a few moments? Oh yes, certainly. Perhaps we will go in the orchard for a little while. I just love those early red apples. Mrs. Brista, on steps, about to go in house. But my dear, just before dinner. And such a dinner. Don't worry, only a nibble you know. Very well. Then I will leave her in your care, Mr. Filmor. Thanks. Trust me. Helen, going left. Will you come? Ask me. I do. But beware, I might tempt you with an apple you know. Oh, what a willing Adam am I. They are about to go out left. He surrenders to her mood. But poor Adam had only an apple to tempt him while I, I see a page. Oh, Mr. Filmor, is that worthy of you? How low are you, too? Mrs. Brista has stood on steps, or porch, watching them with a crafty smile. As they exhumed left, she turns, and is about to go into house, but meets Sarah, and comes back to center. And to Sarah, and you come from house, downstairs to right center. Oh, here you are, Emma. I was looking for you. Lily and tells me you have ordered a boiled dinner. I hope your headache is better, or I am afraid. It is, thank you. But I ordered nothing. It was entirely the made suggestion I assure you. I simply thought it best to submit. She has pretty much her own way, it strikes me. Through our lives suppose she has, I guess I have later have it so long there is no breaking her of it now. Lent Filmor has just been telling me she said something that offended you. You mustn't mind her, Emma. I really couldn't get along without her, you know? I am willing to overlook a great deal, Sarah, but she actually had the presumption to ensignuate that, Helen and I are imposing upon you by remaining here. As if you, my own dear sister. Why can I pretend to be near tears? The idea. Why you welcome to stay here as long as you please, you know that. I feel honored to think it's good enough for you, after all your city grander and everything. Lillian just blots things out. He mustn't pay any attention to her, Emma. Well, I'll try not to do so hereafter. But please, I'll call me, I'm Sarah. It quite annoys me. Does it? Lant did never occur to me. I can't seem to think of Emily in somehow. You see, it sort of seems just the same to me as it did when we were girls here together and we used to always call you Emma in those days. My, but it's a long time since then, isn't it, um, melancholy? Oh, quite too long to mention, or even think about, I should say. I don't see why. Taint no disgrace to be getting all this I can see. All the best people are doing it, you know? Besides, you ain't more than Sarah, please. Oh, well, then I won't. But think how long it is since you were here that other time when Helen was about four years old and your boy was only a baby. Oh, it acute little thing. He was seortic, Emily. Why he must be almost a man now and real joy to you? Joy, my son. Little, you know him or what he is to me. A trial, a tribulation, I may even say a disgrace. Sometimes I think it would have been better had he never been born. Why Emily, what do you mean? I've wondered why you never said much about him, why you never seem to want to tell me, but Emily, your boy, little big, your own son, how can you say such a thing? Because it is true, little has he ever considered me. He spends what he earns on right is living in the company of persons who are called fast and to attempt him to misdeeds and forgetfulness of what is honest at upright. That is the kind of son I have, Sarah. My little dick, as you call him. Dick, the baby boy I used to hold in these arms and cut him up to me and wish was mine. And then that summer you let him come here and stay with me when he was 10 years old, because he wasn't very well. The summer that was like heaven to me because I had him, just like he was mine, my very own. Oh, how I loved him and he learned to love me too. And then I had to give him up, let him go. Back to you who can say such things about him, that he's a trial and a tribulation. Oh, Emily, Emily and Bruce, what kind of mother have you been if you have let him grow up to be that kind of man? I dare say you think I am to blame. Little you know of such matters, of the world of life. Maybe I know more about some things than you think I do. At any rate I know enough about the world and life to know what a real mother ought to be, and that the right kind never would talk that way about her own son, no matter what he was or what he had done. Mother, you, you never was fit to be one, it wasn't in you. Forgive me, Amber, I'm going to speak the truth if it does hurt. When you was a girl, it was all for dressing up and looking pretty with you, going away to boarding school and getting educated as you called it. Well, you did. Therein the real world you talk about and that you say I don't know what understand. Then I think heaven I don't and I wish you didn't. A world that makes a woman so hard that she calls her own son a tribulation and a disgrace, instead of the blessing he ought to be to her. I refuse to listen to any more of your abuse. If my own sister has no right to say such things to me. She crosses to exit left, but Sarah bars her way. She pauses. I guess you'll have to listen Emileen, for I'm going to say what I've got to say. I've headed on my mind for some time and I might as well let it out right now. I thought it was bad enough the way you've let your girl grow up to be proud and vain, though I can see she has her soft side and might make a good woman if she had a chance. But when you talk that way about your boy, about Dick, who was so sweet and cunning when he was a baby, and such a manly little fellow when he was only ten years old, why that's more than I can listen to and not say something. Oh Emileen why wasn't he my boy? Why was he given to you that doesn't care for him, instead of to me who has wanted him and could have been a real mother to him and loved and protected him and helped him to be a good true man instead of what you say he is? It's me that has had the mother feeling in me all these years instead of you, though I'm nothing but a poor little old maid with a soul that has starved to her what you have neglected and thrown away. Mrs. Brister has listened at first distinctly, even angrily, then in a gradually somewhat softened mood. She now shows some tenderness for her sister, though still obviously thinking of herself and her own advantage. I am sorry Sarah. If you have missed what you think would have been your happiness. But my life has been one that you could not understand, you have no right to abraide me. Perhaps you have fair better than I have after all. You at least have a home to shelter you, and after living comfort even luxury, if you wished, the remainder of your life. Well I am at the end of my resources. Unless you help me I see nothing but ruin to spare ahead. Why Emileen what do you mean? I thought you had a grand home. Everything. We have been trying to keep up appearances, Helen and I. She has prospects of marrying a very rich man. If we can manage to go back and resume our custom way of living for another season at least. But unless you can help me, everything I have must go, house furniture all. A few thousand dollars, which I feel sure you can spare. A few thousand dollars? And I never saw more than a twenty dollar bill all at one time in my life as I know of. It was you had the money after father died. If he used it up and caught in debt, why? It seems to me that you are fault, not mine. Oh Sarah, I didn't think you could be so hard. So you refused to help me? You would let me starve your own sister. Well, I guess you won't need to do that as long as I have a home and plenty for you too. But of course, if you're so poor and I'm what you call rich. Why, well, I'll speak to Lendfield more about it. He knows how much I've got and everything. I always take his advice. I should think you need not conform to the opinions of a mere country lawyer. Well, let me be a country lawyer, but he's a good one. And I reckon that's a few city ones you could give a few pointers to when it comes to that. You know, all the smart folks don't live in the city. I guess maybe it's so full. It's run over in the few of them have to stay in the country. Tany Raid, it's Lendfield Merrill, have a talk with, and maybe we can fix things up for ya. Do you know I've sort of thought I'd like to go to the city for a spare myself and see real life as you call it? If Lend things are kind of 40, I might go home with you, set you on your feet and see a little style myself. Got a room you could spare me in that grand mention of yours? Why, I hadn't thought of that. I hardly think you would care for our method of living serrider. It is so different, you know. So, so you needn't get fidgety about it yet a while. I ain't begun to pack my trunk yet. Now I'll have to go in the house and see how Lillian's getting along with that supper, or dinner as you call it. Going to Raid. If you see Lendfield Merrill, you might tell him I want to see him before he goes home. Very well. Serr, on porch, about to enter house. And by the way, if you want that rich man, you spoke about to have a chance. It's my opinion you'd better keep an eye on that daughter or youress and that plain country lawyer. Going to court sort of in his line, you know, and they do say he's pretty good at pleading a case. Exit Serriter house. Mrs. Brewster looks like they're longed. Starts left as if to go and seek Helen and Lennard. Enter Erin. Left up her entrance with milking pills. Erin, coming down through gate. Why, she looking for anybody, Miss Brewster? No. Oh, thought maybe you was, and I was going to say, if it was your daughter and Lendfield Moore, I've seen him out in the orchard there. Eatin' enough apples to give him a stomach ache. Set him pretty close to each other too on the sunwall. Oh, I beg of you, spare me your pleading observations. Gosh, I didn't know I had any. Such high-falutant fixings ain't in my line. He crosses to right, puts pills on porch, comes back to right center. Same, man. If you don't mind, I wish you'd tell me something. I'm gettin' kinda tired of this country life. I like to go to the city and do something. Think they'd any chance for a fellow like me down there? Scaresly. Your place evidently is where you are. Wow, I don't know. Sometimes we country fellas fool ya. Would you think it now to look at me that I got the makings of a first class detective in me? Would ya? No. It is the last thing I should be willing to believe. That's why I thought, but there is. Yes, sir, he, man. Miss Newcombs, she gets all them books and that crimes and such, you know? Detecative stories. Shirt on combs, ashton, Kirk and all them. And sometimes she lets me read them. They certainly do give a fella an insight into the way things are among you city folk. Must be a pretty hard luck, come right down to it. Mrs. Brista, apart to go out left. I have no desire to listen to your opinions. I understand that Miss Newcombs is in the habit of reading those lured romances. And I am much surprised that she should burden her mind with such sensational trash. Oh, she just don't sound him. Says the biggest man, Rita. Even then, Phil Moore. He says they help him in his love, isness. Indeed. I must say that is about the opinion I had of him and his legal ability. Calling as she goes off left. Helen. Helen. Where are you? Exit Mrs. Brista. Left second exit. Aaron going to left calling after her. Better child her and land to stop eating their apples, because Lily Anne says we're going to have a boy dinner, and they won't have room for it. Aaron goes to right takes pales and is about to enter house when he turns. Glances off left upper exit stops, looks. Then sets down pales and goes up to gate, looking off left with a show of interest. Harry's off left upper exit, and after a pause, reenters leading Dick Brewster by the arm. Dick is dusty pale and almost exhausted. Who be you, what do you want? Leeds Dick left to seat. Dick's sinkstone, Aaron regards him suspiciously. Why don't you speak? You sick? No. Only tired. About played out. I... I walked along distance and I haven't had anything to eat since last night. Yeah, gosh, I shouldn't you would be weak. Hmm, you know, look just like a tramp. Dick, with some spirit. I'm not. You need to think of anything like that. I... Is this where Miss Newcomb lives? Why, yes, this is her place. You don't want to see her, do you? I want to know if Mrs. Brewster is here. Mrs. Brewster and Miss Brewster. Oh, you know them, do you? Yes, they're right here. I should say they'd be at Ben's since I don't know when, and it looks like they're going to keep right on me. I... I want to see Mrs. Brewster. Right away. Will you tell her, please? Hmm. Why, yes, I guess so. Looks off left. She's out in the orchard there with her daughter, and Lemphillmore. I'll see him coming now. Dick, rising almost tottering, starting to go right. I... I don't want to see anybody else. Just my... Just Mrs. Brewster. Or Helen. Well, then you just come up here and wait a minute, and I'll see if I can fix it. Here in a cyst stick or fright beyond house, then returns. Stay right there till I tell you. Enter Helen and Leonard. Left second inch, hence. Helen, laughing, evidently forgetting herself at the moment, and acting with a natural manner of good humour. I'm afraid we're in for it. At least I am for a good scolding. I must have eaten at least half a dozen of those apples. It's all your fault. Oh, say, come now. That's reversing scripture, and we'll never do. The woman did tempt me, you know? Nothing of the sort. It was the man who did the tempting this time. All the better, since you yielded, I didn't know I had the power. Thanks for the compliment. You might be welcome. Had I intended to pay you one, but I didn't. Oh, less poor Adam. He's bound to get the worst of it. Thus does he have another fall from the heights of expectation to the deaths of despair. My what an ancient joke going back to the first pair. And the first apple. Oh, worse and worse. And Mrs. Brusta left second entrance, crossing to right. Helen, I'm going to my room, and you'd better come too. After you're walk and such a feast of apples, I should think you would need a little rest and quiet before dinner. Very well, Mother. I'll come right in. Helen crosses to right. Leonard goes up center. And I think I'll say good afternoon. By the way, Mr. Filmore. Ms. Newcome wished me to inform you that she would like to see you again for a moment before you leave. Thanks. Then I'll wait. Exit Mrs. Brusta to house. Yes, you'd better. You might get invited to stay and have some of that bi-led dinner, you know. That's so. Guess I had. Squash pie, too. Garden of Eden was nothing like this. Exit Helen to house, full of ballernet. Enter Erin, right. Looks a bite, then someone's dick. Who enters and stands by fence, right center. You stay right here. I'll see if I can get her. Dick stands leaning on fence, we can show you some agitation. Erin goes over by porch. Looks in house, making motions. She sees me, she's coming. Erin goes and helps Dick to center. Partially concealing him as Helen enters. Did you want me, Erin? Hmm, yes, Ms. Brusta. There's somebody here wants to see it. It's... Dick, disclosing himself. Helen. Dick, Dick, what are you doing here? Where's mother? I... I want to see her. He totters. Helen goes and supports him. But Dick, how did you happen to come here? We didn't expect you. You are ill. Is anything the matter? Yes, lots is the matter. I... I'm in trouble, Helen. I... He looks about. As if not wishing to speak before Erin. Helen motions to Erin, who nods an exit right beyond house, taking pills. There, we are alone now. Tell me, Dick, what is it? What is the trouble? She has assisted him to seek left. He sits, she stands by him, showing more surprise and tenderness, but is not wholly without sympathy. I've... run away. Run away. But why? From what? I can't tell you now. I've got to have money. That's all. Plenty of it. To get away. Out of the country. Where's mother? She couldn't help you any more than I can. What do you mean? What have you done? Never mind that. There isn't time. I'm your brother. That's all. And her son. And you've got to help me. It's for your sake as well as for mine. I guess if you don't want... Oh, Dick, will you never learn to behave yourself to be a man? Mother is almost desperate already with ruin staring her in the face, and now to have you come here in this condition. You, who ought to help her instead of bringing disgrace upon her, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. And so would you be if you were any kind of a sister, instead of turning on me now when I'm facing? Enter Sarah from her support. Take Caesar and shrink down as if to hide. Who's that? I don't want to see. Helen, disclosing him. At Sarah, this is my brother. Sarah, coming down, looking at Dick at first and comprehendingly, and then, with gradual recognition and dawning tenderness. You don't mean that. That it is Dick. Little Dick? Why you... If you haven't grown up into a man. The last time I saw you, you were just a little fellow that was... It was 12 years ago, and you were only 10 years old, and now... Why is Dick? Something is the matter. Dick, breaking down. Or I can't stand anymore. I'm played out. I can't go any further. He has tried to rise, but sinks back onto seat. Sarah goes to him, sits, puts on a bite him affectionately. Why, of course, you can't. You needn't. You've got home, Dick. You've come right here where we've been waiting for you, and I'll land to see you. Oh, you don't know. You don't know. I hope a mother doesn't come. You go in the house and see that she doesn't. I'll talk to Dick and see if I can find out what's the matter. Helen goes left to steps. Dick starts up, puts sinks back as Sarah gently draws him down beside her. But I must see her. I want to tell her. Maybe it would be just as well if you told me. I'm your aunt, Sarah. Though you've sort of forgotten me, haven't you? But I haven't forgotten you when I guess maybe it would be better if you told me about it first, then we'll see. You'll help me to get away. Sarah, to Helen, who still stands left. You go, Helen. He will be alright. Exit Helen left to house. Now Dick, tell me. Oh, I can't. I can't. I don't know what to do. They may be after me by this time. Who? Who is after you? The police, they may have found out by this time. I didn't do it. I didn't. But they will think I did. They'll find out I was there some way. And then, unless I can get away, where they can't find me. But tell me about it. What was it? How did you happen to come here? Why I had heard mother and Helen speak of you. And I remembered you too. About the summer I stayed here so long ago. And how good you were to me. And then I thought they were you. Could help me in some way. I didn't know where else to go. I've got to have money. She's my mother. If I haven't done just right. And she's got to help me. Where is she? I must see her. Pretty soon, maybe. But tell me first. What do they think you have done? It's murder. That's what they'll say. But I didn't do it. No, no, I didn't. It was somebody else. But they'll have it on me if they find out. I was there. I was found with the gun. I'm innocent. But they never believe it. I'll have to go away. He starts up as if to go. Sarah again detains him. But how? Where was it? When? Never mind. Let me go. It may be too late. They may have followed me. Where can I go? You can't go anywhere. You're in no condition. You'll have to stay right here to we can fix you up and decide what to do. What I want now is for you to tell me all about it. Just what happened? What you had to do with it? And everything. And if it's possible, I'll help you. You will. You'll give me money to get away. I don't know about that, but I'll do just the best I can. You can trust me, Dick. Trust me with your very life. It's worth a lot just to hear somebody talk like that. To know somebody believes in me a little bit and wants to help me. It's an old story the way I've been made a fool of by a woman. But I loved her. Trust it her. I thought she was as good as she was beautiful. She thought I was a rich man's son. That was all she cared. And then when she found out I was spending every cent I had just to buy her flowers and then she tried to throw me over. That made me desperate and one night three nights ago. I insisted on going home with her. She tried to get rid of me, but I went. And when we got there, she told me she had no more use for me that I wasn't worth bothering with. Then I threatened her. I'll admit that though I didn't really mean it. I only thought perhaps I could make her change her mind. Then another man came. I really rich one I suppose. And she told me to get out. I wouldn't. So she made me go in another room behind some curtains. She was afraid he'd be jealous too. And when he came in, he suspected there were somebody else there. And they had a row. I stood looking through the curtains, watching them. And all of a sudden. Yes, then all of a sudden? There was a shot. And Laura, Ms. Navar, fell dead. Dead? She was killed? But who? Who did it? Dick, not. No, you didn't think I did it. I didn't. I don't know who did. All I know is that I was alone there in that room behind those curtains and that it was dark in there, so that I couldn't see. And I didn't hear anyone. But I hand reached over my shoulder there in the dark and fired that shot. Did you see the hand? No. But I felt something for an instant. It just seemed to touch my shoulder. That was all. But there must have been somebody else there in that room. Yes, when I went in. But I didn't see anyone. As there was no light in there. They must have been waiting there all the time. For her. And after that shot was fired, what did you do? Why, at first I just stood there for a minute. I was so frightened and dazed. But that other man that was there with her, what did he do? I just caught a glimpse of him, kneeling down by her. He held her up a little. And just then, Ms. Navar has made rushed in from the hall, came across and threw apart the curtains where I was, and there on the floor just by my feet was the gun. She picked it up, stared at me and cried, you have killed her. And the man? I didn't notice. I don't remember. All I know is that the maid went to the telephone to call up the police, I suppose, and before they could stop me, I rushed out and got away. Then I came here. It was all I could do. Oh, you don't think I did it. You don't believe I'm a murderer? You're my aunt. My mother's own sister. You won't let them hang me? No, no, Dick. I want to believe you. I want to help you if you are innocent and I can. You're the same as my own boy. I want to save you. Look at me, Dick. Look me straight in the face and tell me. God's seeing you and hearing everywhere you say. That you didn't kill that woman. You don't know who did. Can you do that, Dick? Yes, I can. I do. He straightens up and with a clear candid expression, finding sudden courage and determination, looks her squarely in the eyes, and in slightly wavering but honest convincing tones, speaks. I swear to you, I didn't kill that woman. I don't know who did. As I hope her eternal salvation, so help me God, I am innocent. Sarah stands motionless for a moment. One hand on each of Dick's shoulders, looking searchingly into his eyes, her face showing infinite tenderness and pity. His gaze never falters. After an eloquent pause, she suddenly clasps him in her arms, holding him closely. He buries his face against her shoulder, sobbing gently. Curtin.

The Amethyst Cross,Fergus Hume,86395,2.0,"December 24, 2020",[],0,"g. The Blackbird knew. He had paired for the fifth time in as many years and had steamed himself wise in the matters of love. Therefore, from the budding chestnut where in his nest was built, did he sympathetically watch the bachelor and maid who sat below? They were lovers as he knew very well. For only lovers could have gazed so persistently into one another's eyes. In their end, they behold each other as each wish to be. Which sentences cryptic to those who are not lovers as these were. They might have looked at the smoothly flowing river, singing quietly to itself not a stone cast away, or round a tangled garden. Delicately beautiful with the young greenery of May, or up into the easier depths of a sky, flexor-soyary clouds. But they preferred wisely it may be to look into each other's eyes, to clasp hands and to remain silent without eloquent muteness, which is the speech of true love. Oh, the Blackbird knew the meaning of these things very thoroughly, and chuckle with such glee that he finally broke into glorious song concerning the new love, the true love, the old love, the bold love, which comes ever more with the blossoms of spring. But these inhabitants of Paradise did not require the bread to reveal the obvious. The hearts were also singing the song of the early year. It can't last forever, remember the maid dreamly. It is too beautiful to last since we are but mortal. It shall last forever, it must, corrected the bachelor, wise in that wisdom of the gods which comes to wewers, for we love with our souls, dearest and these cannot die. She knew that he was right for her heart told or so. Therefore did they again look into one another's eyes and again become silent, while the floating Blackbird explained more than mere human speech could render. And he, perched on a swing bow, was only too willing to interpret. He knew he was wise, and listening nature heard complacently. To such ends had she shaped her children, for such a reason had she provided their Arcadia. As Arcadia, like Marlos Hell is not circumscribed, it chance that this a special one was by tame side, and those who dwelt therein were up to date and looks and dress and manners. Only their feelings were those of classic times, and as he told her the old old story, which is ever new, she listened with the instinctive knowledge that the tale was wonderfully familiar. She had read it in his eyes after the manner of minds long before he dared to speak. And this repair dice was not wholly unworthy at so commonly in Adam and Eve, although limited and extent and untrimmed and looks. Lord Beacon's field declared that the most perfect garden is that cultivated to excess by man, and then handed over to the caprice of nature. The owner of this immense, apparently, subscribed to this dictum for the garden, well-photed with expensive flowers and shrubs, had long since relapsed into wilderness. On either side of the narrow strip of land, slumping gradually to the stream, extended low walls of mellow red brick overgrown with dark green ivy. The flower beds were luxuriant with docks and metals and car lock and diver's weeds. The pathways were untidy with lush grass, and the tiny lawn of the water's edge was shaggy and untrimmed. A wooden landing stage floated near shore at the garden's foot, and to this was attached to the young man's boat. At the far end of this neglected domain could be seen a thatched cottage with white washed walls and a long ladassos, quaintly diamond-pained. So rust to can pridian old world did it look that it might as well have been the fairy dwelling of a nursery tale. The lovers themselves were young and handsmon up to deserve the care of the fairy's. He was tall, swim, well-formed, and sacks in in his fairness. His curly hair, so much of it as the barber's shears had spared, was golden in the sunlight, as was his small mustache, and his eyes were bravely blue as the hearer should be. The white-boating flannels accentuated the bronze of a skin, and revealed the easy strength of an athlete. He looked what the girl took him to be, a slended young lover of romance, yet he was but a city-click of presaic environment, and as youth alone improved him into dawn-worn-oed dreams. The girl resembled heave, made inly, dainty, and infinitely charming, where it might be Tatiana, since her appearance was almost too fragile for the work of day-world, with a milky skin, brown hair and brown-eyed, with a tempting mouth and a well-rounded chin, she looked worthy of any man's loaring. She was sweet in twenty, but he five years older, so both were right for love. And then the spring, joyous and fresh, had much to do with the proposal just made. Her answer to his question had been tunedfully commented upon by the irrepressible blackbird who expressed no surprise when the echo of a kiss interrupted his song. But my father will never agree, George, side the girl, after this outward and visible sound of acceptance. Dearest Lesbier, he folded her men, flina's arms, I don't see why your father should object. I am not rich certainly as a stockbrokers clerk doesn't earn wages, but for your dear sake, I shall work and work and work until I become a millionaire. Lesbier smiled at the sludge promise, we may have to wait for years. What is it matters so long as our hearts are true? They make her sick with waiting, so Lesbier signed, then she proceeded to look on the practical side of their adil, as the most romantic of women will do at the most romantic of moments. You earn only 200 a year darling, and my father, so far as I know, he can give me nothing. He has his pension from Lord Charmington and makes a small income by the work in the city, but here came a depressing pause. What is Mr. Hale doing the city, as George abruptly? Lesbier opened her brown eyes, I don't know, dear. He goes there two or three times a week and always seems to be busy. I have asked him one of his occupation, but he only laughs, and declares that dry business details will not interest me. I'm sure no girl ever knew so little of her father as I do. It's not fair. Strange, remember the young man meditatively? I never see Mr. Hale in the city, and although I have asked several people, no one appears to know the name. Of course, darling, the city is a big place, and your father may do business in a quiet way. Still, it is odd that no one should know. I wish I did, I might help him. In what way? Well, Lesbier, the wages I receive, it takes off as small and, and, and, here, George flesh for no apparent reason, and there are other things to be considered. If I could only get something else to do, I should leave dates. Your father might be willing to let me enter his office, you know, and then I could work up his business, whatever it might be. The girl nodded. She was a matter of fact young woman. Since Hale's income was limited, she was compelled as housekeeper very often to consider ways and means. You might speak to my father. In my act, mention our engagement, he supplemented. No, Lesbier looked out for. I'd better announce that. Father has a temper, and if he grew angry, you might grow angry also. Oh, no. George was entirely an earnest when he said this. I should always remember that he was your father, and that you love him. Lesbier again looked out for. Do I love him? She used. One is supposed to love one's father, suggest a George. She stared at the river. Yes, I suppose so, on a year parents and so forth. I don't donor my father though, his temper is too bad. I'm not quite sure if I love him. Oh, my dear, George looked nervous. Don't make any mistake, dear boy. I like my father since we are good friends, and usually he is kind. That is, when he is not in a rage. But then you see sweetest, she sighed. He is nearly always in a rage about some trifle. Look at the garden. She waved her hand vaguely. I wanted to hire a gardener to make it look more respectable and father was furious. He declared that he did not want people to come spine around the cottage. Spying, such an odd word to use. Your father is an odd man, so George roofily, and he certainly has not been over his pitiful to me. Perhaps he guesses that I have come to seal his jewel, and one can't be hospitable to a robber. Let's be a pinched his chin. He's silly boy, my father doesn't think so much of me as you do. I sometimes wonder, she went on sadly, if he loves me at all. I am very much alone. He doesn't treat you badly, to me enjoyed with sudden heat. No dear, no, I shouldn't allow anyone to treat me badly, not even my father. But I fancy he regards me as a necessary trouble, for sometimes he looks at me in a disagreeable way as though he fancy I was spine. Why do you so disagreeable or word as the straightforward clerk? My father used it himself in the first instance. She would join promptly. Perhaps because he doesn't want anyone else to meet the queer people who come to see him, generally after dark. Man who smell of drink, who use slang and just like grooms, certainly not gentlemen. Of course I never talk to them, for when they appear my father always sends me to my room. I'm sure, said the girl, dolefully, but if it wasn't for all Tim, the servant, I should be quite alone. George Hugdler, you shall never be alone again, he whispered, and let's be a through her arms under his neck with great contentment. Oh darling, you don't know how good that sounds to me. If it were only true, you see my father may object. He can object until he is tired, cred the ardent lover. If he does not make you happy I must, and when he sees this, oh, let's be a claster hand and delighted the sight of a cheap turkish ring. How lovely. George found it the mean gift. It was all I could afford, said he. It is all I want, she said, as she slipped it on her engagement finger. It's not the cost or even the thing. It's what it means. Love and joy to you and me, dearest poor. But George, having a generous heart still lamented. If I hadn't to keep my mother, he said, roofily, I would say that I think give you diamonds. But 200 a year goes a very little way with my mother, even with her small income is a added. You see, dear, she never forgets that my father was the honorable alemer walker, and she will insist upon having everything of the best. This is a beastly cheap ring, but, but, you denied yourself all matter of things to buy it for me, finished Lesbia, pressing a kiss on his willing cheek. No, dear, no, he said, valiantly, only a few types of types of tobacco. You, dear, is donkey, could the girl more touch than she chose to confess? Doesn't that show me how you love me? As to the ring, she surveyed the cheap, trinket critically. It is exactly what I wanted. The stone to the color of your dear eyes. George, manlike, was delighted. You know the color of my eyes? Let's be a boxed his ears delicately. I knew the color exactly one minute after I very first meeting. Did you love me then? No. Certainly not. How conceited you are. Then why did you notice my, oh, woman always notices these things when a man is nice? And you thought me nice? Let's be a fenced. Good looking at all events. You were a dark flannel suit strapped with pale green. So I did, Craig George, delighted. It was at Miss Rardon's picnic near Bishop Abbey a year ago. And you were there. Let's be a laugh to nurse her knees. I must advance since I can describe you exactly. What did I wear, dear? I don't know. So George promptly. Oh, she was quite disappointed. And you call yourself a lover? I do. He rejoins stoutly. For, as I fell in love with you, the moment we met, I saw only your eyes and your angel face. How can you expect me to remember a mere dress when, oh, what nonsense? Very nice nonsense. Still nonsense. I like talking nonsense to you. And I like to hear it from you, but it isn't bread and butter. You're thinking of afternoon tea, so George Walker audaciously. No, I'm thinking of how we are to live when we marry. The mere mention of that delicious word may George forget the warning can be by the sentence. Mary, Mary, you owe heaven. A popper heaven, I fear, said lesbian and fish in her pocket. See, the only valuable thing I possess besides your love. It is for you. Oh, my dear, it's not a man's ornament. And if that matters since I give it to you, she said laughing. I must give you something. And this is all I have to give. She had out her hand, and the palm of which rested an amethyst cross formed of four deeply pale stones, set lightly in gold filigree, with a loop at the top for the necessary chain to pass through. Not a very uncommon ornament to the first glance George decided, although very beautiful. But on looking more closely, he became aware that there was something bizarre about the thing. In the centre where the four stones met was a tiny cube of malachite, graven with a golden crown and inscribed with my new letters. The pansy blossom hue of the stones contrasting with the vivid green of the cube gave the ornament rather an uncanny look. What a queer thing, said George, transferring the cross to his broad palm. Yes, isn't it? Said lesbian eagerly, and then brought on a magnifying glass. And the inscription is still queerer. George poised the powerful glass over the slab of malachite, and was some difficulty deciphered the golden gothic letters. Refuse and lose, he read slowly. Now what does this mean? You stupid darling, cried lesbian, pinching of ear. Can't you see? If you refuse the cross, just married life, you lose the crown. Which is me. Walk a thrust the cross into his pocket, hinted back the magnifying glass and saw only embrace the girl. I'll take the cross and the crown and you and everything I can get. You whisper dinner ear. I don't exactly see the meaning of course, but with their ever such a dense man, it will be a demand of the black bird in despair. It's a religious symbol of course. If you refuse to bear life's cross the way you should, you lose the crown which ought to be yours and heaven. George took the ornament again and looked at it more seriously. He had a considerable strain of the puretine in his nature, to which the idea appealed strongly. I shall certainly not refuse life's cross, he declares so really, and may we both someday wear a crown in a better world. My darling, my dearest, my best, she murmured embracing him fondly. The touch of seriousness and George's gay disposition enhanced his value in her eyes. She approved of so sterling a character. Where did you get the cross, S. Walker, while the jewel's winked in the sunshine? From your father? No, she replied unexpectedly. He doesn't know that I possess such a thing, but my nurse, old Berge Berk, Tim's mother, you know, who died last summer, gave it to me on her deathbed and warned me not to tell my father about it. She said that it came from my dead mother and was to be given to me by the man I loved. So you see, my darling, that even though it is a woman's ornament, you must take it. I'll wear it round my neck to clear George, it will bring me good luck, I am sure. So Berge said, observed the girl promptly, she had the sight, you know, George, and declared that the cross would bring me luck in money and love in position. I don't know you unless it is by marrying you. I love, so George somewhat sadly, I can only give you my heart, money and position must come later, but if we both obey the inscription and bear the cross, we shall win the crown of success in the end. Look how the gems flash, lesbian, and earnest of the future. While they were both admiring the cross, a tall, lean man perfectly dressed in a bond street kit, Kim slowly down the grassy path. He looked like a gentleman, and also like a hawk, and his pale eyes wandered from one bent head to the other until they dropped to the flash at the jeweled cross, which glittered on Walker's poem. Then the newcomers started nervously and took a step nearer to observe. Lesbian her lover looked up as the shadow of the man for the cross, and in the moment they made the cross fell on the grass. Oh, father, how you startled us, cried the girl, springing to her feet. Mr. Walter Hale did not reply. His eyes were still in the purple stones of the cross, and when his daughter stooped to pick it up, he twitched his fingers as though anxious to take it from her. What did you get that? He demanded abruptly and harshly. Britchie gave it to me, and I have given it to George, she said, handing you an amendment to her lover. It belonged to my mother. It did, said Hale sharply, and therefore must not pass out of the family. It won't, so lesbian cheerfully, George is to be my husband. Mr. Hale frowned. You have yet to gain my permission, he said in dry tones. Meanwhile, Mr. Walker gave me back the cross. No, said George, who did not like the tone of his future father-in-law and could be obstinate when necessary. Lesbian gave it to me, and I intend to keep it. Lesbian had no right to give it to you, cried Hale, his voice rising, and extended his hand to take his desire. But Walker was too quick for him, and dexterously swirving, shot the cross into his pocket. It is Lesbian's first present to me, said he excusing his obstinacy. She has no right to make you presence, foam the other, who had now entirely lost his temper. She has the right of a lover, resorted George Kooley. They can be no question of love between you and my daughter. The girl moved to her lover's side, very pale and very defiant. That is for me to decide, she said, coldly, but with determination. You go against your father, Lesbian, for the first time in my life, and why not when the matter is so important? Hale bit his lips and tried to stare her down, but as her eyes did not drop before his own, he was the first to give way, and did so within word rage. With an impatient stroke, he wheeled to face young Walker. The two presented the striking contrast of untainted youth and artificial age, too much versed in the eagles of life. In youth had the advantage for, as in the case of Lesbian, the older man tried to dominate without success, who is forced to take refuge in idle threats. If you do not give me back that cross, it will be worse for you, remarked, tail, very distinctly and with menace. George clenched his fist then with a glance toward Lesbian, ended the argument by stepping into his boat. And he wrote off, hail, who had not attempted to stop him, turned bitterly to his daughter. You have ruined me, he said between his teeth, and returned hastily to the cottage.

And I'd lead tune for the Laquatius Throne, Flutter and Twitter, a prodigal of time, and little masters make a toy of song, to a gravemen weary of the sound of rhyme. William Watson in Wordsworth's grave. There is no doubt that many, one might almost say most, people are firmly convinced that they do not care for poetry. They have no use for it, they tell you. I think it boars them as a fantastic, high-flow method of saying something that, to their way of thinking, could be better said in plain prose, what they look upon it has the sentimental nonsense of the moon's struck and love-sick young, a kind of intellectual candy, or very well for women and children, but of no value to grown men with the serious work of the world on their shoulders. It is not at all difficult to account for, and indeed to sympathize with this attitude. To begin with, of course, there is a large class outside our present considerations, which does not care for poetry, simply because it does not care for any literature, so ever. Serious reading of any kind does not enter into its schema of life, beyond the newspapers and magazines and an occasional novel of the hour, idly taken up and indifferently put aside, it has no literary needs. With this listless multitude we have not to concern ourselves, but rather with that sufficiently heterogeneous body known as the reading public, the people for whom Mr. Carnegie-Bilds-Liber is, and the publishers display their wares, of course, among these, there must necessarily be considerable percentage, temperamentally unappreciative of poetry, just as there are numbers of people born with no ear for music, and numbers, again, born with no colour sense. The lover of poetry is no less born than the poet himself, yet, as the poet is made as well as born, so is his reader, and there are many who really love poetry without knowing it, but who think they do not care for it, either because they have contracted the wrong notion of what poetry is, or because they have some time or other made a bad start with a wrong kind. I'm convinced that one widespread provocative of the prevailing impression of the foolishness of poetry is the mediocre magazine verse of the day. In an NIH when we go so much to the magazines for our reading, we may rely on finding there the best work being done in every branch of literature except the highest. The best novelists, the best historians, and the best essayists right for the magazines, but the best poets must be looked for in their high-priced volumes, and a magazine reader must rely for his verse on Lady Amateurs and two and four college boys. Thus he too often approaches poetry not through the great masters but through the little misses, the forms his natural contemptuous notion of poetry from feeble echoes and incipid imitations. No wonder, therefore, that he should refuse to waste his good eyesight on anything in the shape of verse, and should conceive of poetry as a mild mental dispassion for young ladies a sickly sweet meat made of molasses and moonshine. If the magazine editors of the world would only bind themselves to publish novice except the best, and failing to obtain a contemporary supply of the best, would fill their spare corners of space with reprints of the old refined things, and convince that they would do a great deal toward rectifying this widespread misconception of an art which far from being trivial and superficial is of all the arts the most serious and most vitally human. I'm not saying that all poetry is for all readers. There is a section of poetry which has been called poets' poetry, which of necessity can appeal only to those in whom the sense of beauty and verbal exquisiteness has become specialised. Spencer and Keats, for example, are poets of the rainbow. For the average reader, their poems are the luxuries rather than the necessities of literature. Though, in making a distinction so rough and ready, it must not be forgotten that beauty, happily, is becoming more and more a genuine necessity, nor must it be forgotten either, that rainbows refined and remote as they are, belong also to the realities. It is the reality of poetry that I wish, if possible, to bring home to readers in the article. Some flowers, says George Meredith, have roots, deeper zoaks, poetry is one of those flowers, and instead of it's being a superficial decoration of life, it is rightly understood the organic expression of life's deepest meaning, the essence in words of human dreams and human action. It is the truth of life told beautifully, and yet truthfully. The result only one basis for the longevity of human forms. That basis is reality. No other form of human expression has continued with such persistent survival from the beginning until now as poetry. From the earlier to the absent-minded beggar, it's and the wild flowers for all their adventurous fragility are as old and no less stable than the hills and for the same reason, because they are no less real. The world is apt to credit prose with a greater reality than poetry, but the truth is that the prose of life is real only in proportion as it is vitalised by the spirit of poetry that breeds in all created things. Life, execs practical reasons for the survival of all its forms of expression, and unless poetry served some practical purpose of existence, it would long since have perished. It is because poetry has a practical work to do in the world that it continues and will continue to exist, because it is one of the motive forces of the universe. Life's motive meaning one might almost say the nerve force of existence. A great man has defined it as the finest spirit of all knowledge, and the phrase, though limited, may help us to abroder and deeper apprehension of poetry, and help us to say too that poetry is the finest spirit of all impulse, the finer meaning of all achievement. There is no human interest is our aim to be displayed in all its essential vividness that does not realise the value of a poetical expression. Those who would depreciate the power of poetry, in the sternest practical affairs, have only to be reminded how much modern imperialism owes to Rudiad Kipplin, and it is by no means trivial to remark that the most successful advertisements have been inverse. So soon as poetry so-called really is poetry, it's appeal is immediately admitted and its force undeniably felt. It is the false poets who account for the false ideas of poetry. One has only to confront a practical man with the real thing to convince him that, without realising it, he has cared a great deal about poetry all his life. Probably, he has imagined that this great stumbling block has been the verse. Why not say it in plain English he has impatiently exclaimed? Thinking all the time of bad verse, of lifeless, contorted rhyming, and of those metrical inanities of the magazines, and yet, when you bring him a verse that is really a live in which the meter is felt to be the very life beat of the thought, you don't find him asking to have it turned into prose. How about Mandelae in prose, for example, or that old bugle call of Scots, sound sound the clarion fill the fife to all the sensual world proclaim one crowded hour of glorious life, is worth an age without a name. Or Tennyson's tears idle tears or co-rages, he prayeth best to loveeth best, all things both great and small, for the dear God who loveeth us, he made and loveeth all. Or the quality of mercy is not strained, or under the green wood tree, or Mr Swinburne's, ask nothing more of me, sweet, or I can give you I give, heart of my heart, worth it more, more would be laid at your feet, love that should help you to live, song that should spur you to saw. In all these cases, the verse is immediately felt to be the very life of the expression, for the reason that it echoes in words, the life rhythms to which unconsciously, or such human emotions keep time, say it in prose, can you say a trumpet in prose or a tear or a butterfly? If you can, your prose is really poetry, and will be found to be eloquent with sunken rhythms not immediately obvious to the ear and eye. The first thing to realize about poetry is that the meter is demeaning, even more than the words. In Tennyson said, tears idle tears, for example, it is not so much the words that are accountable for the Westwood sorrow of the general effect, as the sad, rain-like melody, mysterious the charging the words with sorrow, like some beautiful interpretative voice, and it is this subtly mimatic quality and this the adaptable which is the reason that the of meter and the secret of its power over mankind. Perhaps it may help us to attempt here a definition of poetry, though it is a bold, even foolhardy thing to do, for there has never yet been a definition of poetry that satisfied anyone but the man who made it. We may recall one fashionable in its day, Matthew Arnold's poetry is a criticism of life, that a poet should have made such a harrowing definition is amazing, though one, of course, understands it in the light of the fact that the inspiration of Matthew Arnold's muse was almost entirely that of a philosophical criticism of life. Far from being a criticism of life, poetry is much more like a recreation of it, it is life in words, but let me timidly launch my own definition. Poetry is that in passion to range among of words, whether in verse or prose, which embodies the exhultation, the beauty, the rhythm, and the pathetic truth of life. There is a motive idealism behind all human action of which most of us are unconscious, or to which we ordinarily give but little thought, a romance of impulse, which is the real significance of human effort. The walls of thieves were built to music, according to the old story, but so were the walls of every other city that has ever been built. The skyscrapers of New York are soaring to music also, a masterful music of the future, which not all can hear, and of which perhaps the music make us themselves are most ignorant of all. Once more, in Emerson's immortal phrase, the builders are building better than they know. These ruthless speculators and stern businessmen, who are the last to suspect themselves of the poetry which they involuntarily serve. Human life, in the main, is thus unconsciously poetical and moves to immortal measures of a mysterious spiritual music. It is this impassioned exhultation, this strange rhythm, this spiritual beauty, the finer spirit of life, which the poet sees is on and expresses, and therewith also that pathus which seems to in here in all created things. We read him because he gives that value of life which we feel belongs to it, but for which we are unable to find the words ourselves. How often one has heard people say on reading a poem, why that is just what I have always felt, but could never express. And the exclamation was obviously a recognition of the truth of the poem. The poet had made the true observation and recorded it with all the vividness of truth. It is the business of the poet to be all the time thus recording and recreating life in all its manifestations, not only for those who already possess something of the poetic vision, yet lack the poetic utterance, but also for those who need to be awakened to the ideal meanings and issues of life. Poetry is thus seen to be a kind of lay religion, revealing and interpreting the varied beauty and nobility of life. But a better way than theorizing to show the use, the sweet uses of poetry is to call the names of some of the great poets and ponder what they have meant and still mean in the life of humanity. Dante, Milton and Wordsworth for example, and to them we might add titson, browning and Matthew Arnold. How much these six poets alone have meant to the grave or life of humanity, the life of religion, a thought of conduct, particularly with regard to the four poets of the last century. We are compelled to note how far more than any professed teachers and thinkers, they were the teachers and thinkers of their age, and did indeed mold the thought of their century. For how many have wordsworths prelude, tenicens in memoriam, brownings rabbi ben esra, and Matthew Arnold's impedicities have been literally sacred books, books of daily exercise and meditation, to enable only a few of their more typical poems. They are well worn today, but think what forces in the world these lines of wordsworth have been. The world is too much with us late and soon, getting and spending. We lay waste our powers. Little we see in nature that is ours. We have given our hearts away, a sorted boom. Tenicens says, are God in nature that it's strife, that nature lends such evil dreams. So careful of the type she seems, so careless of the single life, that I, considering everywhere, her secret meaning in her deeds, and finding that a 50 seeds she often brings but one to bear, I falter where I firmly trot, and falling with my weight of cares, upon the great world's altruistic, that slope through darkness up to God, I stretched lay hands of faith, and grope, and gather dust and chaff, and call to what I feel is Lord of all, and faintly trust the larger hope. I quote this from Matthew Arnold, it is so small of thing to have enjoyed the sun, to have lived light in the spring, to have loved, to have thought, to have done, to have advanced true friends, and be down baffling foes, that we must fain a bliss of doubtful future date, and while we dream on this, lose all our present state, and relegate to worlds yet distant our repose. These lines, and many more like them that one could quote, have done definite spiritual service from mankind, have inspired countless men and women with new faith, new hope, and new fortitude, who remain permanent springs of sustenance for the human spirit. Again, the mere mention of such names is Gert, a buyer, and a Shelley carries with it their tremendous significance in the practical life of the modern world. When we think of such figures as a car over and over again in the history of poetry, we realize that tenisons, one poor poet scroll that shook the world, was known the aboish inflation of the poet's mission. That sad musical poet, Arthur O'Shanacy, said no more than the truth when he sang, in verse like the motion of moonlight on water. We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers, and sitting by desolate streams, world losers, and world foresakers, on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers of the world forever, it seems. To realize what a Shirley political force poetry has been in America alone, one has only terracow the poems of Wittier and Lowell, Poe and Longfilo, and Julia Wardhouse, a mortal battled him of the Republic. But apart from such strenuous and stern services, how many other services no less valuable has poetry rendered to mankind, services of joy and universal sympathy. The poet often so sad himself, sings all men's joys and sorrows as if they were his own, and there's nothing that can happen to us. Nothing we can experience, no stroke of fate, and no mood of heart to a mind, that we cannot find expressed and interpreted for us somewhere in some poet's book. Take with one poet, Robert Burns, for instance, and think of the immense addition to the sum total of human pleasure and human consolation that his handful of scotch songs has made. Who asks, what's the use of poetry when he joins in all-dlangsign, and feels his heart stirred towards tearful deaths with the sentiment of human brotherhood, and the almost tragic dearness of friends, and who that has ever been in love has not once in his life felt the brotherly hand of a fellow experience and had we never loved say kindly, had we never loved say blindly, never met or never parted, we had never been brokenhearted, and been consoled somehow, with that mysterious consolation which belongs to the perfect expression of sorrow. If the simple songs of a scotch peasant have been of so much use to the world, what of that lordly pleasure house of Shakespeare? Think of the boundless universe of mere delight that has written over its door, the works of Shakespeare, the laughter, the wisdom, the beauty, the all-comprehending humanity. If it be of no use to make man happy, to quicken in them the joy of life, to heighten their pleasures, to dry their tears, to bind up their wounds. If it be of no use to teach them wisdom, to open their eyes, to purify and direct their spirits, to gird them to fight, to brace them to endure, to teach them to be gentle, then indeed we may ask, what's the use of poetry? But while poetry can do all these things, I think it must be allowed by the most practical that it has a very important part to play in the work of the world. To end, as I began, with that practical man who imagines that he does not care for poetry, I gave one or two explanations of his distaste. But there is one other important one that must not be forgotten. He begins to often with paradise lost. I mean that he too often attempts some tough classic before he is ready for it, and because he cannot read Milton with pleasure, imagines that he does not care for poetry at all. Thus he finds himself bewildered by the insipid magazine muses on the one hand, and the unscalorie of the other. Too many make the famous Mr. Boughlin's mistake of beginning the study of English literature with Gibbons decline and fall, and what wonder if a man beginning the study of English poetry with Browning's Sordello should imagine, like Douglas Gerald in the story, either that his mind was failing him, or that there was something radically wrong with the poet. Actually a man may love poetry very deeply and care nothing at all for paradise lost. He may also find nothing for him in Homer, or a Shellus, or Dante, or Goetha. The great architectural works of such masters may seem too godlike and grim for his gentler human need. But give him a handful of violets from Ophilia's grave, or a bunch of herics, daffodils, or take him out under the sky where Shellus' dark is singing, or try him with a lyric of hines, or some ballad of old unhappy far off things, and battles long ago, and you will see whether or not he loves poetry. The mistake is in thinking that all poetry is for all readers. On the contrary, the realm of poetry is as wide as the world, for the very reason that each man may find there just what he needs and leave the rest. The thing is to discover that poetry that was meant for us, and perhaps the best way to do that is to turn over the pages of some well-made selection, and see where our eyes yet caught and held. Paul Graves' golden treasury is, of course, the classical anthology, a little volume filled with the purest gold of English lyrical poetry. Footnote, the golden treasury when it was published more than 40 years ago, was certainly the finest anthology that had been made in England, and it still holds its place as a very choice collection of British poets, small and select, and a footnote. If a man should read in that for an hour and find nothing to his taste, it is to be feared that he was born deaf to the sweet rippling of the Perian spring. But, as I have said, I believe that few have been so hardly treated by nature. A poet died young in every one of us, said someone, I think he did not so much die as fall asleep. Nor is he so fast asleep, but that the right song, song right, would have made a wake in him. What is the use of poetry? It is just the whole use of living, and let anyone who doubts it enter the garden for himself. I come ye hither to this pleasant land, for here in truth are vines of engaddy, hear golden irons of mana to thy hand, and rocks when sunny flows deliciously, others from which comes frothing copiously the milk of life, ears filled with sweetest grains, and fig trees knowing no stirrilyty. Here, paradis all streams make rich the plains, oh come and bathe therein ye world worn weary swanes. Richard Lee Gallien, End of What's The Use of Poetry by Richard Lee Gallien.

Adam Bede (version 2),George Eliot,112017,2.0,"September 10, 2020",[],0,"vox.org recording by Tom Denham. Adam Bede by George Elliott. Chapter 1. The Workshop. With a single drop of ink for a mirror, the Egyptian sorcerer undertakes to reveal to any chance come a far reaching visions of the past. This is what I undertake to do for you, Greedor. With this drop of ink at the end of my pen, I will show you the roomy workshop of Mr. Jonathan Burge, carpenter and builder in the village of Hayslope, as it appeared on the 18th of June in the year of our Lord, 1799. The afternoon sun was warm on the five workmen there, busy upon doors and window frames and wains cutting. A scent of pinewood from a tent-like pile of planks outside the open door, mingled itself with the scent of the elder bushes, which was spreading there some as snow close to the open window opposite. The slanting sun beams shone through the transparent shavings that flew before the steady plane and lit up the fine grain of the oak paneling which stood propped against the wall. On a heap of those soft shavings, a rough grey shepherd dog had made himself a pleasant bed and was lying with his nose between his forepaws, occasionally wrinkling his brows to cast a glance at the tallest of the five workmen, who was carving a shield in the center of a wooden mantelpiece. It was to this workman but the strong baritone belonged, which was heard above the sound of the plane and hammer singing. A wick by soul learned with the sun thy day is day, y'all of duty run, shake off dull sloth. Here some measurement was to be taken, which required more concentrated attention and the sonorous voice subsided into a low whistle. But it presently broke out again with renewed vigor. The earth all thy converse be sincere, thy conchens as the noon day clear. Such a voice could only come from a broad chest and the broad chest belonged to a large bone muskilamannirli six feet high with a back so flat and a head so well poised that when he drew himself up to take a more distant survey of his work, he had the air of a soldier standing at ease. The sleeve rolled up above the elbow, showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength, yet the long supple hand with its broad fingertips looked ready for works of skill. In his tall, stoll-witness, Adam bead was a Saxon, and justified his name. But the jet black hair made them more noticeable by its contrast with the light paper cap and the keen glance of the dark eyes, the shone from under darkly marked prominent and mobile eyebrows indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of good humod honest intelligence. It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adam's brother. He is nearly as tall, he has the same type of features, the same hue of hair and complexion. But the strength of the family likeness seems only to render more conspicuous the remarkable difference of expression both in form and face. Seth's broad shoulders have a slight stoop, his eyes are grey, his eyebrows have less prominence and more repose than his brothers, and his glance instead of being keen is confiding and benign. He has thrown off his paper cap, and you see that his hair is not thick and straight like Adam's, but thin and wavy, allowing you to discern the exact contour of a coronal arch that predominates very decidedly over the brow. The idle trumps always felt sure they could get a copper from Seth, they scarcely ever spoke to Adam. The concept of the tools and Adam's voice was at last broken by Seth who lifting the door which he had been working intently placed it against the wall and said, there I finish my door today anyhow. The workman all looked up. Jim salt, a burly red-haired man known as Sandi Jim, paused from his planning, and Adam said to Seth, with a sharp glance of surprise, what does this finish the door? I sure said Seth with answering surprise, what's a wanton toot. A loud roar of laughter from the other three workman made Seth look round confusingly. Adam did not join in the laughter, but there was a slight smile on his face, as he said, in a gentler tone than before, why these forgot the panels. The laughter burst out of fresh, as Seth clapped his hands to his head and colored over browned crown. Hooray! Shouted a small lie, fellow, called Wierry Ben, running forward and seizing the door. Will hung up the door at fur end of the shop and right on Seth bead the methodology, his work. Here Jim, then told the red pot. Nonsense, said Adam, let it alone Ben-crunch. You may have been making such a slip yourself someday. You laugh at the other side of your mouth then. Cach me, I did, Adam, it'll be a good while of all my heads full of the methodies, said Ben. No, but it's often full of drink and that's worse. Ben, however, had now got the red pot in his hand and was about to begin writing his inscription, making by way of preliminary an imaginary S in the air. Let it alone will you, Adam, call out, laying down his tools, striding up to Ben and seizing his right shoulder. Let it alone or I'll shake the soul out of the body. Ben shook in Adam's iron grasp, but like a plucky small man as he was, he didn't mean to give in. With his left hand, he snatched the brush from his powerless right and made a movement as if he would perform the feet of writing with his left. In a moment, Adam turned him round, seized his other shoulder and pushing him along, pinned him against the wall. But now Seth spoke, let be Adi, let be, Ben will be joking, while he's either right to laugh at me, I can't help laughing at myself. I shant Lucim, till he promises to let the door alone, said Adam. Come, Ben, lad, said Seth in a persuasive tone, don't let's have a quarrel about it. You know, Adam will have his way, you may as well try to turn a wagon in an arolane, say you leave the door alone and make an end on. I'd been afraid it'd Adam, said Ben, but I'd done a mine saying as I let to learn at your ask in Seth. Come, that's wise of you, Ben, said Adam, laughing and relaxing his grasp. They all returned to their work now, but why are he Ben, having had the worst in the bodily contest, was bent on retrieving that humiliation by a success in sarcasm? Which was you thinking on Seth, he began, the pretty pass in his face, or her garment, when you forgot the panels, come and hear a Ben, said Seth, good, he'll immediately, she's gone to preach on the green tonight, happen you'd get something to think on yourself, then, instead of those wicked songs you saw fond on, he might get religion, and that'd be the best days earnings you ever made. All a good time for that, Seth, I'll think about that when I'm going to settle a life. Bachelors doesn't want such heavy earnings, happen I shall do a courten, and the religion both together, as Yiddou Seth, but he wouldn't have had me get converted, and chop in a tweenier in the pretty preacher, and carry her off. No fear of that Ben, she's neither for you nor for me to win I doubt, only you come in here, and you won't speak lightly on her again. Well, I'm half a mind to have a look at it tonight, if there isn't good company at the Holy Bush. What does she take for her text? Happen you can tell me, Seth, if so be as I should in a come up with a timefront, will it be what come me out for to see? A prophetess? Yay, I say unto you, and more than a prophetess, are uncommon pretty young woman. Come Ben, said Adam, rather sternly, you let the words of the Bible alone, you're going too far now. What are yea-turnin' round, Adam? I thought ye would dead again the women preaching a while ago, and I'm not turning away. I said, note about the women preaching. I said, you let the Bible alone. You've got a gest book on you as your rare and proud on. Keep your dirty fingers to that. Why yea-getteners, bigger sanders, Seth, you're going to the preaching tonight, I should think. You'll do finally to leave this thing, but I don't know what past an earwine will say at his grand favourite Adam be, to turn in Methody. Never do you bother yourself about me, Ben? I'm not going to turn Methodist any more than you are, though it's like enough you'll turn to something worse. Mr. Erwine's got more sense, not a medal where people's doing as they're like in religion. That's between themselves and God, as he sent to me many a time. Oh yea-but he's non-sefond a young descendors for all that. Maybe, I'm non-sefonded just thoughts thick ale, but I don't hinder you from making a fool yourself with. There was a laugh at this thrust of Adam's, but Seth said very seriously, nay-ne-adeh, the must-nessaers anybody's religions like thick ale. They just no believe, but what the dissenters and the Methodists have got the root of the matter as well as the church forks. Nay Seth-lad, I'm not for laughing at no man's religion, let him follow their consciences, that's all. Only I think it'd be better if their consciences had let him stay quiet in the church. There's a deal to be learnt there. And there's such a thing as being overspiritial. We must have something beside gospel of this world. Look at the canals and the aqueducts and the core pit engines and our Christmills there at crumford. A man must learn some of it decide gospel to make them things are reckoned. But to hear some of them preachers, you'd think that a man must be doing nothing all's life, but shutting eyes and looking what's going on inside him. I know a man must have the love of God in his soul, and the Bible's God's word. But what does the Bible say? Why it says, as God put his spirit into the workman as built the tabernacle, to make him do all the carved work and things as wanted a nice hand. And this is my way of looking at it. There's the spirit of God in all things and all times, weekday as well as Sunday, and in the great works and inventions, and in the figurine and the mechanics, and God helps us with our head pieces and our hands as well as with our souls. And if a man does bits of jobs out of work in ours, builds an oven for his wife to save her from going to the bay cows, or scratch it his bit of garden and makes two potatoes grow instead of one. He's doing more good, and he's just this near to God, as if he were running after some preacher and a praying and a groaning. Well, John Adam said Sandi Jim, who had paused from his planning to shift his planks while Adam was speaking, that's the best salmon I've heard this long while, by the same token my wife's been a plague on me to build her oven this 12-month. There's reason in what they say is Adam, observed Seth Gravley, but he knows this self as it's here in the preaches they find so much fault with, has turned many an idle fellow into an industriouson. It's the preacher as empties the airhouse, and if a man gets religion, he'll do his work on the worse for that. Only he'll leave the panels out of the door sometimes, Seth said, why, Reban, are Ben, you've got a joke again me as the last you your life, but it is no religion as way fault there, it was Seth Beed, as was always a woo-gathering chop, and religion has no cure them, the mourns the pity, near he'd me, Seth said why Reban, you're a downright good-hearted chop, panels on all panels, and you'd done a set up your bristles at every bit of fun like some of your kin as his may-haplic cliverer. Seth lad, said Adam, taking no notice of the sarcasm against himself, the must-natek me on kind, I wasn't adriven at thee in what I said just now, some's got one way of looking at things and some's got another, ne ne adi, thee means me no-unkindness, said Seth, I know that well enough, the like that dog jip, the barks it me sometimes, but the arllest licked me hand after, all hands worked on in silence for some minutes, until the church clock began to strike six. Before the first stroke had died away, sandy gym had loosed his plane and was reaching his jacket. Wiry Ben had left a screw half-driven in and thrown his screwdriver into his tool basket. Mum taft, who, true to his name, had kept silence throughout the previous conversation, had flung down his hammer as he was in the act of lifting it, and Seth too had straightened his back and was putting out his hand towards his paper cap. Adam alone had gone on with his work as if nothing had happened. But observing the cessation of the tools, he looked up and said in a tone of indignation, look there now, I can't abide to see men throw away their tools in that way, the minute the clock begins to strike, because if they took no pleasure of that work and was afraid of doing a stroke too much. Seth looked a little conscious and began to be slower in his preparations for going, but Mum taft broke silence and said, oh yeah, Adam, lad, you talk like a young and when you're six and forty like me, instead of six and twenty, you'll want to be so flush at work and for note. nonsense, Seth Adam still ruffle what's age got to do with it, I wonder, you're on a getting stiff yet arreken. I hate to see a man's arms drop down as if he was shot before the clocks fairly struck, just as if he'd never a bit of pride and delight in his work, a very grindstone will go on turning a bit after you lose it. moderation, Adam, exclaimed why he been, leave a chapel on willy, you were a find and fought with preachers a while ago, you're fond enough of preaching your sin, he may like work better not play, but I like play better not work, that'll come a day ye, it leaves ye the more to do. With this exit speech which he considered effective, why reband showed at his basket and left the workshop quickly followed by Mum taft and Sandi Jim. Seth lingered and looked wistfully at Adam as if he expected him to say something. shall go home before they go to the preaching, Adam asked looking up, nah I've got me half in things it will masqueries, I shouldn't be home before going for ten, I'll happen see Dynamor and say for me if she's willing, there's nobody comes with her from poises they noticed, then I'll tell mother not to look for thee, said Adam, the art now going to poises they self tonight said Seth rather timidly as he turned to leave the workshop, nah I'm going to the school, here the two, jip had kept his comfortable bed, only lifting up his head and watching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workman departing, but no soon did Adam put his ruler in his pocket and begin to twist his apron round his waste, then jip ran forward and looked up in his master's face with patient expectation. If jip had had a tail he would doubtless have wagged it, but being destitute of that vehicle for his emotions, he was like many other worthy personages destined to appear more flecmatic than nature had made him, what? I'm ready for the basket, a jip said Adam with the same gentle modulation of voice as when he spoke to Seth. Jip jumped and gave a short bark as much as to say, of course, poor fellow, he had not a great range of expression. The basket was the one which on workdays held Adam and Seth's dinner and no official walking in procession could look more reasonably unconscious of all acquaintances than jip with his basket, trotting at his master's heels. Or leaving the workshop Adam locked the door, took the key out and carried it to the house on the other side of the woodyard. It was a low house with smooth grey thatch and buff walls, looking pleasant and mellow in the evening light. The ledded windows were bright and speckless and the doorstone was as clean as a white boulder at Abtide. On the doorstones to the clean old woman in a dark striped linen gown, a red cuchif and a linen cap, talking to some speckled fouls which appear to have been drawn towards her by an illusory expectation of cold potatoes or barley. The old woman's sight seemed to be dim for she did not recognise Adam till he said, is the key dolly, lay it down for me in the house will you? I sure, but what are you coming Adam? Miss Mary's at the house and Mr. Burj will be back and on, he'd be glad to ha ye to supper whim, I'll be's warrant. No dolly, thank you, I'm off home. Good evening. Adam hastened with long strides. Chip close to his heels, out of the workyard and along the high road, leading away from the village and down to the valley. As he reached the foot of the slope, an elderly horseman with his port mantos draped behind him, stopped his horse when Adam had passed him and turned round to have another long look that the stalwart workman in paper cap, leather breaches and dark blue-wasted stockings. Adam unconscious of the admiration he was exciting, presently struck across the fields and now broke out into the tune which had all day long been running in his head. Lurt all thy converse peace sincere, thy conchants as the noon day clear for God's all-seeing eyes are veys, thy secret thoughts thy works and ways.

The Abysmal Brute,Jack London,104154,6.0,"December 25, 2020",[],0,"t Librevox.org. Recording by Warren Coddy, Gerny Illinois. The Abysmal Brute by Jack London. Chapter 1. Sam Stubner ran through his mail carelessly and rapidly. As became a manager of prize fighters, he was accustomed to a various and bizarre correspondence. Every crank, sport, near sport and reformer seemed to have ideas to impart to him. From dire threats against his life, two milder threats, such as pushing in the front of his face. From rabbit-foot fetishes, two lucky horses, from dinky, jerk-water bids to the quarter of a million dollar offers of irresponsible nobody's. He knew the whole run of the surprise portion of his mail. In his time, having received a razor-strop, made from the skin of a lynched negro, and a finger, withered and sundried, cut from the body of a white man found in Death Valley. He was of the opinion that never again would the post-man bring him anything that could startle him. But this morning, he opened a letter that he read a second time, put away in his pocket, and took out for a third reading. It was post-marked from some unheard of post office in Siskew County and at ran. Do you Sam? You don't know me except my reputation. You come after my time, and I've been out to the game a long time. But take it from me, I ain't been asleep. I've followed the whole game, and I've followed you from the time Cal Offman knocked you out to your last handling of Nat Pelsen. And I take it, you're the niftyest thing in the line of managers that ever came down the pike. I got a proposition for you. I got the greatest unknown that ever happened. This ain't con, it's the straight goods. What do you think of a husky that tips the scales at £220 fighting weight is 22 years old, and can hit the kick twice as hard as my best ever? That's him, my boy, young Pat Clinton. That's the name Hill Fight Under. I've planted all out. Now the best thing you can do is hit the first train and come up here. I bred him and I trained him. All that I ever had in my head, I've hammered into his. And maybe you won't believe it, but he's added to it. He's a born fighter. He's a wonder at time in distance. He just knows to the second and the inch, and he don't have to think about it at all. His six inch jolt is more the real sleep medicine than the full arm swing of most geysers. Talk about the hope of the white trace. This is him, come and take a peek. When you was managing Jeffries, you was crazy about hunting. Come along and I'll give you some real hunting and fishing that will make your moving picture winnings. Look like 30 cents. I'll send young Pat out with you. I ain't able to get around. That's why I'm sending for you. I was going to manage him myself, but it ain't no use. I am all in and likely to pass out anytime. So get to move on. I want you to manage him. There's a fortune in it for both of you, but I want to draw up the contract. You're a stewardly Pat Glendon. Stubner was puzzled. It seemed on the face of it a joke. The man in a fighting game wore notorious jokers, and he tried to discern the fine hand of Corbett, or the big friendly paw of Fitzsimmons, in the screen before him. But if it were genuine, he knew it was worth looking into. Pat Glendon was before his time, though, as a cub, he had won seen old Pat Spar at the benefit for Jack Dempsey. Even then, he was called old Pat, and had been out of the ring for years. He had antidated Sullivan, and the old London prize ring rules, though his last fading battles had been put up under the incoming Marquiss of Queen's Berry rules. What ring follower did not know of Pat Glendon, though few were alive who had seen him in his prime, and there were not many more who had seen him at all. Yet his name had come down in the history of the ring, and no sporting writer's lexicon was complete without it. His fame was paradoxical. No man was honored higher, and yet he had never attained championship honors. He had been unfortunate, and had been known as the unlucky fighter. Four times he all but won the heavyweight championship, and each time he had deserved to win it. There was the time on the barge in San Francisco Bay, when, at the moment he had the champion going, he snapped his own forearm. And, on the island in the teams, sloshing about in six inches of rising tide, he broke a leg at a similar stage in a winning fight. In Texas, too, there was the never-to-be forgotten day, when the police broke in, just as he had his man going in all certainty. And finally, there was the fight in the mechanics pavilion in San Francisco, when he was secretly jobbed from the first by a gunfighting bad man of a referee backed by a small syndicate of betters. Pat Glendon had had no accidents in that fight, but when he had knocked his man cold with a right to the jaw and a left to the solar plexus, the referee calmly disqualified him for fouling. Every ring-side witness, every sporting expert, and the whole sporting world knew there had been no foul, yet like all fighters, Pat Glendon had agreed to abide by the decision of the referee, pat-abided, and accepted it as in keeping with the rest of his bad luck. This was Pat Glendon. What bothered Stubner was whether or not Pat had written the letter. He carried it downtown with him. What's become of Pat Glendon? Such was his greeting to all sports that morning. Nobody seemed to know. Some thought he must be dead, but none knew positively. The fight editor of a morning daily looked up the records, and was able to state that his death had not been noted. It was from Tim Donovan that he got a clue. Show our hand he ain't dead. Said Donovan, how could that be? A man of his make that to never boozed or blew himself? He made money, and what's more he saved it and invested it. Didn't he have three saloons at the one time? And wasn't he making slathers a money with him when he sold out? Now that I'm thinking, that was the last time I laid eyes on him. When he sold them out, it was all of twenty years in morgue. His wife had just died. I met him head in for the fairy. Where a wailed sport says I, it's me for the woods, says he, I've quit, goodbye to him, my boy, and I've never seen him from that day to this. Of course he ain't dead. You say when his wife died did he have any children? Stubner quared. One little baby, he was lugging it in his arms that fairy day. Was it a boy? How should I be knowing? It was then that Sam Stubner reached a decision, and that night found him in a pulmon, speeding toward the wilds of northern California. Stubner was dropped off the other land at deer lick in the early morning, and he kicked his heels for an hour before the one saloon opened its doors. No, the saloon keeper didn't know anything about Pat Clinton had never heard of him. And if he was in that part of the country, he must be out beyond somewhere. Neither had the one hanger on ever heard of Pat Clinton. At the hotel, the same ignorance obtained, and it was not until the storekeeper and postmaster opened up that Stubner struck the trail. Oh, yes, Pat Clinton lived out beyond. You took the stage at Elpine, which was 40 miles in which was a logging camp. From Elpine, on horseback, you rode up and to low valley, and crossed the divide to Bear Creek. Pat Clinton lived somewhere beyond that. The people at Elpine would know. Yes, there was a young Pat. The storekeeper had seen him. He had been in to deer lick two years back. Old Pat had not put in an appearance for five years. He bought his supplies at the store and always paid by check, and he was a white-haired, strange old man. That was all the storekeeper knew, but the folks at Elpine could give him directions. It looked good to Stubner. Beyond out, there was a young Pat Clinton, as well as an old one, living out beyond. That night, the manager spent at the logging camp of Elpine, and early the following morning, he rode a mountain coyus up and to low valley. He rode over the divide and down Bear Creek. He rode all day through the wildest, roughest country he had ever seen. And at sunset, turned up Pinto Valley on a trail so stiff and narrow that more than once he elected to get off and walk. It was 11 o'clock when he dismounted before a log cabin and was greeted by the baying of two huge deer hounds. Then Pat Clinton opened the door, fell on his neck and took him in. I knew you'd come, Sam, me boy, said Pat, the wild he limped about, building a fire, boiling coffee, and frying a big bear steak. The young and eight home the night, we was getting short of meat, and he went out about sundown to pick up a deer, but I'll say no more, wait to you see him. He'll be home in the morning, and then you can try him out. There's the gloves, but wait to you see him. As for me, I'm finished. 81 come next January, and pretty good for an ex-bruser, but I never wasted myself, Sam, nor kept the late hours and burned the candle at all ends. I had a damn good candle and made the most of it as you'll grant it, looking at me. And I've taught the same to the young. What do you think of a lad of 22 that's never had a drink in his life? Nor tasted tobacco. That's him. He's a giant, and he's lived natural all his days. Wait till he takes you out after deer. He'll break your heart, travel and light, him, carrying the outfit in a big buck deer be like, he's a child of the open air, and winter nor summer has he slept under a roof. The open for him, as I taught him. The one thing that worries me is how he'll take to sleep in houses. Now he'll stand at tobacco smoke of the ring. To the terrible thing that smoke, when you're fighting hard and gasping for air, but no more, Sam, may boy, you're tired and sure should be sleeping. Wait till you see him, that's all. Wait till you see him. But the garyolusness of age was on old pat, and it was long before he permitted stupiners eyes to close. He can run a deer down with his own legs that young and he broke out again. This is the dandy training for the lungs, the hunter's life. He don't know much of else though. He's read a few books at times in poetry stuff. He's just plain pure natural, as you'll see when you clap eyes on him. He's got the old Irish strong in him. Sometimes the way he moves about, it's thinkin' strong I am, that he believes in the theories and such like. He's a nature lover of ever there was one, and he's a fear of cities. He's read about him, but the biggest he was ever in was deer lick. He misliked the many people, and his report was that they'd stand we'd an out. That was two years ago. The first and the last time he'd seen a locomotive in a train of cars. Sometimes it's wrong, I'm thinkin' I am, bringing him up a natural. It's given him wind and stamina to strengthen our bulls. No city grown man can have a look in against him. I'm willing to grant that jeffries, that is best. Could have worried the young and a bit, but only a bit. The young and could have broke him like a straw. And he don't look at. That's the everlasting wonder of it. He's only a fine-seeming young husky, but it's the quality of his muscle that's different. But wait to you see him, that's all. A strange liking the boy has for posies, and little meadows. A bit of pine with a moon beyond, windy sunsets are the sun of mourns from the top of old baldy. And he has a hankerin' for the drawing of pictures of things, and of spoutin' about Lucifer or night, from the poetry books he got from the red-headed school teacher. But his only his youngness, he'll settle down to the game once we get him started. But watch out for grouches when he first comes to live in a city for him. A good thing, he's woman-shy, they'll not bother him for years. He can't bring himself to understand the creatures, and damn few of them as he seen at that. 12th of the school teacher over at Samson's flat that put the poetry stuff in his head. She was clean-daffy over the young and he never a-knowing. A warm-haired girl she was, not a mountain girl, but from down in the flatlands, and as time went by she was fair desperate. And the way she went after him was shameless. And what do you think the boy did when he tumbled to it? He was scared as a jackrabbit. He took blankets and ammunition and hiked for tall timber, not for a month that I lay eyes on him, and then he sneaked in after dark, and was gone in the morning. Nor were he as much as peep at our letters. Burnham, he said, and Burnham I did. Twice she wrote over on a call you, saw the way from Samson's flat, and I was sorry for the young creature. She was fair hungry for the boy, and she looked at it in her face. And at the end of three months she gave up school and went back to her own country, and then it was that the boy came home to the shack to live again. Women have been the ruination of many a good fighter, but they won't be of him. He blushes like a girl if anything young and skirts looks at him a second time, or too long the first one. And they all look at him, but when he fights, God, it's the old savage Irish that flares in him and drives the fists of him, not that he goes off his base, don't walk away with that. At my best eye was never as cool as he. I missed out, twuzz the wrath of me that brought the accidents, but he's a nice bird. He's hot and cold at the one time, a live wire and a nice chest. Stubner was dosing, when the old man's mumble aroused him. He listened drowsily. I made a man of him by God, I made a man of him, with the two fists of him, and the upstand and legs of him, in the straight sea and eyes, and I know the game in my head, and I've kept up with the times and the modern changes. The crouch, sure he knows all the styles and economies, he never moves two inches when an inch and a half will do the turn, and when he wants, he can spring like a buck kangaroo. In fighting, wait, do you see, better than his outfighten, and he could sure a sparred with Peter Jackson and outfitted Corbyte at his best. I tell you, I've taught him it all, to the last trick, and he's improved on the teaching. He's a fair genius at the game. And he's had plenty of Husky Mountain men to try out on. I gave him the fancy work and they gave him the slug and nothing shy or delicate about them. Raw and bulls and big grizzly bears, that's what they are, when it comes to hugging in a clinch or swing and rough like in the rushes, and he plays with him. Man, do you hear me? He plays with him, like you and me would play with little puppy dogs. Another time, Stubner awoke, to hear the old man mumbling. Tis the funny thing, he don't take fight in seriously. It's that easy to him, he thinks it's play, but wait to waste half to swift one. That's all, wait, and you'll see him throw on the juice in that cold storage plant of his, and turn loose the prettiest scientific wallopin that ever you laid eyes on. In the shivering gray of mountain dawn, Stubner was routed from his blankets by old pat. He's coming up to trail now. Was the horse whisper? How it's with you and take your first pee pet to biggest fightin man that ring is ever seen, or will ever see in a thousand years again. The manager peered through the open door, rubbing the sleep from his heavy eyes, and saw a young giant walked into the clearing. In one hand was a rifle, across his shoulders, a heavy deer, under which he moved as if it were waitless. He was dressed roughly in blue overalls, and a woolen shirt open at the throat. Coat he had none, and on his feet, instead of brogons, were moccasins. Stubner noted that his walk was smooth and cat-like, without suggestion of his £220 of wait, to which that of the deer was added. The fight manager was impressed from the first glimpse. For a middle-old young fellow certainly was, but the manager sensed the strangeness and unusualness of him. He was a new type, something different from the run of fighters. He seemed a creature of the wild, more a night-roming figure from some old fairy story or folk tale than a 20th century youth. A thing Stubner quickly discovered was that young pat was not much of a talker. He acknowledged old pat's introduction with a grip of the hand, but without speech. And silently set to work at building the fire and getting breakfast. To his father's direct questions he answered in monocilables as, for instance, when asked, where he had picked up the deer. South fork was all he vowed shaped. He leaven miles across the mountains. The old man exposited pridefully to Stubner, and a trail that had break your heart. Breakfast consisted of black coffee, sourdough bread, and an immense quantity of bear meat, broiled over the coals. Of this, the young fellow ate ravenously. And Stubner defined that both the glendons were accustomed to an almost straight meat diet. Old pat did all the talking, though it was not till the meal was ended, that he broached the subject he had at heart. Hats boy, he began, you know who the gentleman is? Young pat nodded, and cast a quick comprehensive glance at the manager. Lail, he'll be taking you away with him and down to San Francisco. I'd sooner stay here, Dad, was the answer. Stubner felt a prick of disappointment. It was a wild goose chase after all. This was no fighter, eager and fretting to be at it. His huge brawn counted for nothing. It was nothing new. It was the big fellows that usually had the streak of fat. But old pat's Celtic wrath flared up, and his voice was harsh with command. You'll go down to the city's invite me boy. That's what I've trained you for, and you'll do it. All right, was the unexpected response, rumbleed apathetically from the deep chest, and fights like hell. The old man added, again, Stubner felt disappointment at the absence of flash and fire in the young man's eyes, as he answered. All right, when do we start? Oh, Sam, here he'll be wanting a little hunting and to fish a bit, as well as to try you out with the clothes. He looked at Sam, who nodded. Suppose you strip and give him a taste of your quality. And our later, Sam Stubner had his eyes opened, and expiter himself, a heavyweight at that. He was even a better judge of fighters, and never had he seen one strip to like advantage. See the softness of him, old pat chanted, tis the true stuff, look at the slope of the shoulders and the lungs of him, clean all clean to the last drop in ounce oven. Here, looking at a man's Sam, the like of which was never seen before. Ah, to muscle of him bound, no weight liftor or sandile exercise heart is there. See the fat snakes of muscles are crawling soft and lazy like, weight deassee them flashing, like a striking rattler. He's good for 40 rounds this blessed instant or 100. Go to it, time. They went to it for three minute rounds with a minute rests, and Sam Stubner was immediately undecieved. Here was no streak of fat, no apathy, only a lazy good nature play of gloves and tricks with a brusk stiffness and harsh sharpness in the contacts that he knew belonged only. And only to the trained and instinctive fighting man. Easy now, easy, old pat warned, Sam's not the man he used to be. This snuttled Sam as it was intended to do, and he played his most famous trick and favorite punch, a faint for a clinch and a right ripped to the stomach. But quickly as it was delivered, young pat saw it, and though it landed, his body was going away. The next time, his body did not go away. As the rip started, he moved forward and twisted his left hip to meet it. It was only a matter of several inches, yet it blocked the blow, and thereafter, try as he would. Stubner's glove got no farther than that hip. Stubner had ruffed it with big men in his time, and, in exhibition bouts, had creditably held his own. But there was no holding his own here. Young pat played with him, and in the clinches made him feel as powerful as a baby, landing on him seemingly at will, blocking him blocking with masterful accuracy, and scarcely noticing or acknowledging his existence. Half the time, young pat seemed to spend and gazing off and out the landscape in a dreamy sort of way. And right here, Stubner made another mistake. He took it for a trick of old pat's training, tried to sneak in a short arm jolt, found his arm in a lightning lock, and had both his ears cuffed for his pains. The instinct for a blow, the old man chortled, his not put on, I'm telling you, he's a whiz. He knows a blow without the looking, when it starts and wear the speed and space and niceness of it, and his nothing I ever showed him, his inspiration, he was so born. Once, in a clinch, the fight manager healed his glove on young pat's mouth, and there was just a hint of viciousness in the manner of doing it. A moment later, in the next clinch, Sam received the heel of the other's glove on his own mouth. There was nothing snappy about it, but the pressure, staluedly lazy as it was, put his head back to the joints cracked, and for the moment he thought his neck was broken. He slacked his body and dropped his arms and token that the bout was over, felt the instant release, and staggered clear. He'll heel-do, he gasped. Looking the admiration, he lacked the breath to utter. Old pat's eyes were brightly moist with pride and triumph. Hand what you'll be thinking to happen when some of the gay and ugly ones tries to rough it on him. He asked, he'll kill them sure, was Stubner's verdict. No, he's too cool for that, but he'll just hurt them, Sam, for their dirtiness. Let's draw up the contract, said the manager. Wait, do you know the whole worth of him? Old pat answered, ""'Tis strong terms, Alibi, make and you come to? Go for a deer hunt with the boy over the hills and learn the lungs and the legs of him. Then we'll sign up ironclad and regular.'"" Stubner was gone two days on that hunt, and he learned all, and more than old pat had promised, and came back a very weary and very humble man. The young fellow's innocence of the world had been startling to the case hardened manager, but he had found him, nobody's fool. Virgin, though his mind was, untouched by all, save a narrow mountain experience. Nevertheless, he had proved possession of a natural keenness and shrewdness far beyond the average. In a way, he was a mystery to Sam, who could not understand his terrible equanimity of temper. Nothing ruffled him or worried him, and his patience was of an enduring primativeness. He never swore, not even the feudal and he masculated cusswords of Sissy boys. I'd swear all right if I wanted to. He had explained, when challenged by his companion. But I guess I've never come to needing it. When I do, I'll swear I suppose. Old pat, resolutely adhering to his decision, said goodbye at the cabin. Here, it won't be long, Pat's boy, but now I'll be reading about you in the papers. I'd like to go along, but I'm a fear that's me for the mountains till the end. And then, drawing the manager aside, the old man turned loose on him almost savagely. Remember what I've been telling you over and over, the boys clean and he's honest, he knows nothing of the rottenness of the game. I kept it all away from him, I tell you, he don't know the meaning of fake. He knows only the bravery and romance and glory of fighting, and I've filled him up with tales of the old ring heroes, though little enough God knows it's set him a fire. Man, man, I'm telling you that I clip the fight columns from the newspapers to keep it away from him, him, I think, and I was wanting them for a miscrap book. He don't know a man ever laid down or threw a fight. So don't you get him in anything that ain't straight. Don't turn the boys stomach. That's why I put in the null and void clause. The first rottenness and the contracts broke of itself. No snide division of stake money, no secret arrangements with the moving pitcher men for guaranteed distance. There's slathers a money for the both of you, but play it square or you lose, understand. And whatever you'll be doing, watch out for the women, was old-pats parting at Monishment, young-pat astride his horse in reigning in due tofully to hear. Women is death in damn nation, remember that. But when you do find the one, the only one, hang on to her, she'll be worth more than glory and money. But first be sure, and when you're sure, don't let her slip through your fingers, grab her with the two hands of you and hang on, hang on if all the world goes to smash and smithereens. Pat, boy, how good women is? How good women? Tis the first word in the last.

Recording by Craig Franklin. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Chapter 1. Down, the rabbit hole. Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice, she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it. And what is the use of a book? Thought Alice. Without pictures or conversations? So she was considering it in her own mind, as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid. Whether the pleasure of making a Daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkably in that. And Alice think it's so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself, oh dear, oh dear, I shall be late. When she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wandered at this. But at the time, it all seemed quite natural. But when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its wastecoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet. For it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a wastecoat pocket, or a watch to take out of it. And burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it popped in a large rabbit hole under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was going to get out again. The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some time and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly. For she had plenty of time when she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything. Then she looked at the sides of the well, a notice that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves. Here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shells as she passed. It was labeled orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment it was empty. She did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. Well, thought Alice to herself. After such a fall as this, I should think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they all think me at home. Why? I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house. Which was very likely true. Down, down, down. What the fall never come to an end. I wonder how many miles I fallen by this time. She said aloud. I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see, there could be 4,000 miles down, I think. For you see, Alice had learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school room. And though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her. Still, it was good practice to say it over. Yes, that's about the right distance. But then I wonder what latitude or longitude I've got to? Alice had no idea what latitude was. All longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say. Presently, she began again. I wonder if I should fall right through the earth. How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards. The antipathies, I think. She was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn't sound at all the right word. But I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Mom, is this New Zealand or Australia? And she tried to curtsy as she spoke. Fancy curtsying as you're falling through the air. Do you think you could manage it? And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking? No, it'll never do to ask. Perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere. Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do. So Alice soon began talking to herself. Dying will miss me very much tonight, as you think. Dying was the cat. I hope they'll remember her saucer milk a tea time. Dying a my dear. I wish you were down here with me. There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bet. And that's very much like a mouse, you know. Do cats eat that, I wonder? And here, Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way. Two cats eat bats, two cats eat bats. And sometimes, two bats eat cats. For you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dina and seemed to her very earnestly. Now, Dina, tell me the truth, did you ever eat a bat? When suddenly, dump, dump, down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up onto her feet in a moment she looked up. But it was all dark overhead. Before her, was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still inside hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice liked the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my ears and whiskers, how bleated it's getting? She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen. She found herself in a long, low hole, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly, she came upon a little three legged table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall. But, a less. Either the locks were too large or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it, was a little door about 15 inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitting. Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a ret hole. She knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains. But she could not even get her head through the doorway. And even if my head would go through, thought poor Alice. It would be a very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a tell-escope? I think I could, if I only knew how to begin. For you see, so many out of the way things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think, that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it. Or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like tell-escobs. This time she found a little bottle on it. Which certainly was not here before. said Alice. And round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me, beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say drink me. But the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. No, I look first. She said, And see, whether it's marked poison or not. For she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burned and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things. Or because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them. Such as, that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long, and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it's usually bleeds. And she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison, it's almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later. However, this bottle was not marked poison. So Alice eventually tasted and finding it very nice. It had in fact a sort of mix flavor of cherry tart, custard, pineapple, rose turkey, toffee, and hot butted toast. She very soon finished it off. What a curious feeling. Sid Alice. I must be shutting up like a devil's scope. And so it was indeed. She was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for getting through the little door into that lovely garden. First however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further. She felt a little nervous about this. For it might end, you know. Sid Alice to herself, it might going out altogether. Like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then. And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after their candle is blown out. For she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once. But a less for poor Alice. When she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key. And when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it. She could see it quite plainly through the glass. She tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery. And when she had tied herself out with trying the poor little things sat down and cried. Cough, there's no use in crying like that. Said Alice to herself rather sharply. I advise you to leave off this minute. She generally gave herself very good advice. Though she very seldom followed it. And sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes. And once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet. She was playing against herself. For this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. But it's no use now. Thought poor Alice. To pretend to be two people? Why this hard enough of me left to make one respectable person? Soon, her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table. She opened it and found in it a very small cake. On which the words, eat me, were beautifully marked in currents. Well, I'll eat it. Said Alice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key. And if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door. So either way, I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens. She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, which way? Which way? Holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing. And she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake. But Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing, but out of the way things to happen, that he seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she said to work, and very soon, finished off the cake.

Daddy O'Lear was playing Blackjack when the Colonel's orderly found him. He hastily buttoned his tunic and in a few minutes alert and very military, was standing at attention in the little office on the ground floor of the Denver IFP barracks. His swanky blue uniform fitted with that arinkle. His little round skull cap was perched at the regulation angle. O'Lear said the Colonel. They're having a little trouble at the blue-reverestation mercury. A trouble. Uh-huh. O'Lear said placidly. The Colonel looked him over. He saw a man past his first youth. 35 possibly 40. O'Lear was well-knit, Sandy Heard, not over five feet, six inches in height. His hair was close-cropped. His features fligmatic is eyes a light blue with thick, short, light-colored lashes. His teeth exiled. A scar dead white on a brown cheekbone was a reminder of an encounter with one of the numerous sorions of Venus. I'm sending you, explain the Colonel, because you're more experienced, and not like some of these kids, so he's spoiling for a fight. There's something clear about this affair. Moronus, factor of the blue-reverest post, reports that his assistant has disappeared. Vanished. Simply gone. But only three months ago, the former factor Moronus was his assistant disappeared. So high nor hair of him. Moronus reported to the company the Mercury in trading concession, and they called me. Something they think is rotten. Yes, sir. I guess I mean it until you, the Colonel went on, that you have to use tact. People don't seem to appreciate the force. What would the lousy politicians be grudging every cent we get, and a bunch of suspicious foreign powers afraid we'll get too good? And I know, tact, that's my motto, no rough stuff. He saluted, turned on his heel. Just a minute. The Colonel had a risen. He was a fine, ascetic type of man. He held at his hand. Goodbye, O'Lear. Watch yourself. When O'Lear had taken his matter-fact departure, the Colonel ran his fingers through his whitening hair. In the past several months he had sent five of his best men on dangerous missions. His requiring tact, courage, and so it seemed very much luck. And only two of the five had come back. In those days the interplanetary flying police did not enjoy the tremendous prestige it does now. The mere presence of a member of the forces enough in these humdrum days of interplanetary law and order. The quell the most serious disturbance anywhere in the solar system. But it was not always thus. This astounding prestige had to be earned with blood and courage in many a desperate and lonely battle. Had to be snatched from the tripping jaws of death. O'Lear checked his flying o' void. Got his bearings from the poor astronomer, set his coordinate navigator, and shoved off. Two weeks later he plunged into the thick, misty atmosphere on the dark side of Mercury. Ancient astronomers had long suspected that Mercury always presented the same side to the sun. Though they were ignorant that the little planet had water and air. At sunward side is a dreary, sterile, hot and hostile desert. It's dark side is warm and humid, and resembles to some extent the better known jungles and swamps of Venus. But it has a favored belt, some hundreds of miles wide, around it to quater, where the enormous sun stays perpetually in one spot on the horizon. Sunward is the blinding glare of the desert. On the dark side enormous banks of lowering clouds. On the dark margin of this belt are the ringstorms, violent thunderstorms that never cease. They are the source of the mighty rivers which irrigate the tropical habitable belt and plunged out boiling far into the desert. O'Lear's little ship passed through the ringstorms, and he did not take over the controls until he recognized the familiar mark of the trading company, a blue comet on the aluminum roof of one of the larger buildings. Visibility was good that day, but despite the unusual clarity of the atmosphere there was a suggestion of the sinister about the lifeless scene. The vast irresistible river, the riotously colored jungle roof, the vastness of nature dwarfed the man's puny work. One horizon flashed incestantly with vivid lightning, the other was one blinding blaze of the nearby sun. And almost lost below in the savage landscape was man's simple possession, a few metal sheds, in a clear fence space of a few acres. The clear cautiously checks speed, skimmed over the turbid surface of the great river, and set her down on the ground within the compound. With his pencil-like ray tube in his hand, he stepped out of the hatchway. A myr curian native came out of the residence, presently his hands together in the peace sign. For the benefit of earth lovers whose only knowledge of mercury is derived from the teleview screen, it should be explained that mycurians are not human, even if they do slightly resemble us. The hatch from eggs pass one life phase as frog-like creatures in their rivers, and in the adult stage turn more human in appearance. But their skin remains green and fish belly white. There is no hair on their warky heads. Their eyes have no lids, and have a peculiar dead staring look when they sleep. And they carry a peculiar fishy odor with them at all times. This mycurian looked at a layer seemingly without interest. Where is myrowness? The officer inquired. Myrowness, the native piped in English, inside, he busy. Alright, I'm coming in. He busy. Yeah, move over. Though the native was a good six inches taller than a layer, he stepped aside when the officer pushed him. Then, and mycurians had a way of doing that when they looked into those colorless eyes. They were not as flagmatic as the face. Myrowness was sitting in his office. Well, I'm here, O'Lear announced helping himself to a chair. Yes, sourly. Who invited you? O'Lear looked at the fact that he was a praising him. A big man fat, but the fat well distributed. After nine face, dark hair, dark and bristly beard, the kind of thruybler other men became weak and fever-ridden. Also, the judge buys present appearance and unpleasant companion and a nasty enemy. Don't see what difference makes to you. O'Lear answered in his own good time. But the company invited me. They would. Myrowness growled. His eyes flickered to the door and quick as a cat O'Lear leaked to one side, his rape pencil in his hand. Myrowness had not moved and in the door stood the native, motionless and without expression. Myrowness laughed nastily. Kind of chumpy, eh? What is it, Myrgo? Myrgo burst into a burbling succession of native phrases which O'Lear had some difficulty following. Myrgo wants to move your ship into one of the sheds but the activator keys gone. Yeah, I know. O'Lear ascended casually. I got it. Leave the ship till I get ready. Then I'll put it away. Get out, Myrgo. The native hesitated. Then on the lift of Myrowness's eyebrows departed. O'Lear shifted a chair so that he could watch both Myrowness and the door. He reopened the conversation easily. Well, we understand each other. You don't want me here and I'm here. So what are you going to do about it? Myrowness flushed. He struggled to keep his tempered out. What do you want to know? What happened to the factor who was here before you? I don't know. The translucine wasn't coming in like it should. Samus went out into the jungle for a pilava with a chiefs to find out why. And he didn't come back. You didn't find out where he went. I just told you, Myrowness said impatiently. He went out to see the native chiefs. Alone? Of course alone. There were only two of us earthmen here, couldn't abandon this post to the loggeleys. Could we? Not that it would make much difference except for Nargal, the mental come near. You never heard of him again? No, damn it. No. Say, didn't they have any dumb or strappers around the new? I told you once. I tell you again. I never saw a height nor hair of him after that. All right. All right. O'Lear regarded Myrowness placidly. And so you took the job of factor and radioed for an assistant. And when the assistant came, he disappeared. Maroness grunted. He went out to get acquainted with a country and didn't come back. O'Lear masked his close scrutiny of the factor under his idle and expressionless gaze. He was not ready to jump to the conclusion that Maroness' uneasiness spraying from a sense of guilt. Guilty or not, he had a right to feel uneasy. The man would be dense indeed if he did not realize he was in line for suspicion and he did not look dense. Indeed he was obviously a shrewd character. Let me see your Lucine. Maroness rose. Despite his bulky stepped nimbley, he had the nimbleness of a Saturnian bear which is great as some of the earlier explorers learned there to smell. Well, that's the first sensible question you've asked. Maroness noted, take a look at our Lucine. Have a good look. He led the way across the compound, wave this hand before the door of a strongly built shed in a swift definite combination and the door opened revealing the interior. He waved invitingly. You go first, O'Lear said, with a sneer Maroness stepped in. Here is safe, boy. You're safe. The Lure looked at the small pile on the floor in astonishment. Instead of the beautiful, semi-transparent chips of translucent, the dried sap of a mercury and tree which is invaluable to the world as the source of an unfailing cancer cure. There are only few dirty dried-up shavings, hardly worth shipping back to earth for refining. The false significance of the affair began to dawn on the officer. The translucent trees grew only in this fared section of mercury and the earth company had a monopoly of the entire supply. Justly, for only an earth was cancer known and it was on the increase. That small, almost useless pile on the floor can noted a terrible drug famine for the human race. Maroness's smile might have been a great of satisfaction at a Lure's question. Is that all you've bought since the last frater was here? It is, he replied, the last load went off six months ago and this year's shed should be full to the ease. There'll be hell to pay. It may not be tactful, O'Lear remarked, but if you've got your takeings cashed away somewhere to hold up the earth for a big ransom, you'd better come across right now. You can't get by with it, fellow. You should have closed a $6 million worth of it and you can't get away. You just can't. Maroness controlled his anger with an effort. Like any dumb strapper you've got your mind made up, ain't you? Well, go ahead, get something on me. Here I was almost set to give you a lead, I might get you somewhere and you come shooting off, trying to make out I stole the loosing and killed those two fellows, eh? Go ahead, get something on me. But not on company grounds. You're leaving now. With that he made a lunge at the officer quite beside himself with rage. O'Lear could have burnt him down, but he was far too experienced for such an amateurish trick. Instead he ducked to evade Maroness's blow. But the big man was his agile sapanther. In mid-air so it seemed he changed his direction of attack. The big fist swept downward, striking O'Lears head, a glancing blow. But the men of the force have always been fighters, whatever their shortcomings is diplomats. O'Lear countered with a strong right to the body, stunning solidly. For Maroness's softness did not go far below the surface. The factor whirled instantly, but not quite fast enough to bar the door. O'Lear was out and inside his ship in a few seconds, slamming the hatch. Tacked, he grinned to himself inserting the activator key. Tacked is what a fellow needs. Go little space flyer shot aloft until the tiny figure of the factors stopped shaking its fist and entered the residence. The post had a flyer of its own, of course, but Maroness was too wise to use it in pursuit. O'Lear considered what was best to do. Of course he could have placed Maroness under arrest, could still do it. But that would not solve the mystery of the two deaths and the missing Lucine. If the collard factor was really guilty of the crimes, it would be better to let him go his way and the hope that he would betray himself. O'Lear regretted that he had not kept his tongue under closer curve, but there was no use of regretting. Perhaps after all he ought to turn back and pump Maroness for some helpful information. His mind made up, he descended again until he was hovering a few feet from the ground. Maroness, he called, Maroness, he held the hatch open. Maroness came to the door of the residence. He had a tube in his hand, a long range weapon. Maroness, O'Lear declared pompously, I place you under arrest. The effect was instantaneous. Maroness lifted the tube and a glimmering, he redescent beams spring out. The ship was up in a way in a second, lurking and shivering uncomfortably every time the beams struck it in its upward flight. A good few seconds continued impingement. But a miss is as good as a light ear. Miles high O'Lear looked into his tail ends. Maroness had laid aside his tube and was working with an instrument like a twin transit. Plotting the ship's course naturally. O'Lear said his course for the earth and kept it on for a good 24 hours. Maroness, if he was still watching him, would think he'd gone back for reinforcements. Such an assumption would be incredible now, but that was before the IFP had achieved its present tremendous reputation. Beyond observation range, O'Lear curved back toward Mercury again and was almost inside its atmosphere what he made a discovery that caused him to lose for a moment his natural indifference. The clamp is jaws and anger. The current oxygen tank became empty and when he removed it from the rack and put in a new one he found someone had let out all of this essential gas. The valve of every one of the spare tanks had been opened. Had O'Lear actually continued on his way to earth he would have perished miserably of suffocation long before he could return to the Maccuria atmosphere. The officer whistled toolessly through his teeth as he considered this fact. The visibility was by this time normal, that is so poor it would have been possible to lay in very close to the trading station. O'Lear was taking no chances however and came down a good 3 earth miles away. The egg shaped hull sank through the glossy brilliant treetops through twisted vines and was buried in the dank gloom of the jungle. Here it might remain hidden for a hundred years. The twilight of the jungle was almost darkness, landmarks were not, but O'Lear made a few small inconspicuous marks on trees with his knife until he came to an outcropping rock. He had noticed a scar-like white of it slashing through the jungle from the air and used it as a guide to direct his stealthy return to the trading post. His belt chronometer told him it would be about time for Moronus to get up from his night's sleep. A little discreet observation might tell much. Long before he reached the compound O'Lear heard the rushing of the great blue river in its headlong plunge to the cross of heat of the desert. And then through the mist, he glimpsed the white metal walls of the company sheds. He climbed the tree and for a long time watched patiently, lying prone on a limb, blood sucking insects tortured him and flat tree-lice resembling discs with legs, crawled over him inquisitively. O'Lear tolerated them with stoic indifference until at last his patience was rewarded. Moronus was coming out of the compound. He was alone and obviously did not suspect that he was being watched, for he stepped up briskly. Once in the jungle he walked even faster, watching out whereally for the panther-like kind of aura that were the most dangerous demand on Mercury. O'Lear shined the ground and followed cautiously. Moronus had his right to with him as any traveler and these jungles did. O'Lear could and did draw fast, but a dead trader would be valueless to him in his investigation. So he stalked it with every faculty strained to maintain complete silence. Often in the occasional clearings where the brown darkness grew less, he had the gravel on the slimy ground, picking up large bacteria that could be seen with a naked eye, and which left tiny festering red marks on the skin. Mercury has no snakes. The trader seemed to be heading for higher ground for the path led ever upward, although not far from the tossing waters of the river. And then suddenly he disappeared. O'Lear did not immediately hurry after him. O'Lear can if you did of catching sight of his pursuer might suddenly drop to the ground and squirm to the side of the trail, there to wait and catch his pursuer as he passed. So O'Lear cycled into the all but impenetrable underbrush, and slowly with infinite caution, warmed his way along. Presently he came to the little rise of brown, where Moronus had disappeared, but a pain-staking search did not reveal the factor. There were however a number of other trails that joined a very faint trail he had been following, and now there was a well-defined track which continued to lead upward. With a grimace of disgust O'Lear again plunged into the odorous underbrush and traveled parallel to the trail. It was well he did so for several mercury ins past swiftly, intense so it seemed and answering a shrill call that at times came faintly to the ear. They carried slender spears. Several more mercury ins past. The growth was thinning out, and O'Lear did not dare to proceed further. However from his hiding place he could discern a number of irregular cave openings, apparently leading downward. They were apparently the entrances to one of the native cavern colonies, or possibly of a meeting place. No earth man had ever entered one, but it was thought they had underground openings into the river. As the cave openings were obviously natural O'Lear conjectured that there might be others that were not used. After an anxious search he found one, narrow and irregular, well hidden under the broad, glossy leaves of some uncatalog vegetation. As it showed no evidence of use, O'Lear unhesitatingly slid down into it. It was very narrow and irregular, so that often he was barely able to squeeze through. The roots of trees choked the passage for a dozen feet or so, requiring the vigorous use of a knife. The way then sweat is uniform of filthy massive rags, O'Lear at last saw light. The passage ended abruptly near the roof of a large natural cavern. Lights glistened on stalactites, which cut off O'Lear's larger view, and voices came from below. By craning as neck the officer could look between the pendant icicles of rock and see a fire burning on a huge oblong block of stone. Years were sitting on the floor around this block, hundreds of mercury ins. The leaping flames made their white and green faces and bodies look frog-like, and less human than usual. But the figure that dominated the whole assemblage, both by its own hugeness and the magnetic power that flowed from it, was not of mercury, but of Pluto. For the benefit of those who have never seen a stuffed plutonian in our museums, and they are very rare. Let me refer you to the Pius books still to be found in ancient library collections. The ancients personified their fears and hates in a being they called the Devil. The resemblance between the Devil of their imagination and the plutonian is really astounding. Horns, hoofs, tail, almost at the smallest detail the resemblance is there. Philosophers have written books on the coincidence and appearance of the ancient devil and the modern decrant plutonians. So plutonians were once numerous and far advanced in science, and no doubt they called on the earth many times in prehistoric days, and the so-called Devil was a true picture of those vicious invaders, who are somewhat less human than usually portrayed. What was once clastas superstition was therefore a true racial memory. Long before our ancestors came out of their caves to build houses, the plutonians had mastered interplanetary travel. Only to forget the secret until human ingenuity should reveal it once more. The modern plutonian in that dank cave was over ten feet tall, and it is easy to see why he dominated the assemblage. His black visage was set in an evil smile, his ebony body glistened in the firelight. He held a three prong spear on one hand and sat on a pile of rocks, a sort of rough throne, so that he towered magnificently above all others. He spoke to Maccurian language, although the liquid intonations came harshly from his sneering lips. Are ye assembled frog folk that you may hear the decision of your thinking ones? He asked. Our respectful peeping chorus signified a scent, but in that there was a hint of unrest, even a fear. Speak, ye thinking one, your commands. Here me first, an old Maccurian, unusually tall, faded and dry looking, his thick-eyed wrinkled like crushed leather, rose slowly to his feet and stepped before the oblong stone. His back was to the plutonian, his face to the crescent of chiefs. The old wise one, a twittering murmur went around the assemblage. Here the old wise one! Hi people, I like this knot! The guanyate shunt. The lords of the green star, flak-note one, in their various languages, almost all solar races call earth, the green star, although conditions on Mercury are unfavorable, earth can be seen from the dark star on mountain tops, during occasional dispersals of the cloud masses. And flak-note. Have dealt with us fairly, each phase, footnote two. The Mercury ins had no conception of time before the earthman came. A phase is the time between calls of the freight ships, and is therefore variable, but in those days it was about six or seven months, and footnote. They have brought us the things we wanted. He touched his spear and a few gaudy ornaments on his otherwise naked body. In exchange for the worthless white sap of our trees, if we longer offend the lords of the green star, a rockist laugh interrupted the Mercury and Feeble voice, and it echoed eerily from the walls of the chamber. Valueless you call the white sap, sneered the plutonian, hear me, that sap you call valueless is dear than life itself to the lords of the green star. Or they are afflicted in great numbers with a stinking death they call cancer. It destroys their vitals, and nothing, nothing in this broad universe can help them, save this white sap you give them. In your hands you have the power to bring the proud lords of the green star to their knees. They would fill this chamber many times with their most priceless treasures for the sap you give them so freely. If hold the sap and your thinking ones may go to the green star itself to rule over its lords, they are desperate. Their emissaries may even now be on the way to beg your pleasure. Speak thinking ones, would you not rule the green star? But the chiefs failed to become enthused, one of them rose in a dressed plutonian. A lot of the outer orbit, for near one full phase, have each wealth among us, and will should ye know we have no desire for conquest. We fear to go to the green star to rule. That let me rule for ye, exclaim the plutonian instantly. My brothers will abide with ye as your guests. She'll see that ye receive a fair reward for the white sap, and I will convey your commands to the lords of the green star. The old wise one raised his withered hands so that the uncertain chittering of voices which followed the plutonian suggestion subsided. My children pipe the feeble old voice. The black lord has spoken cunning words, but they are faults. It is plain to see that he desires to rule the green star, and our welfare does not concern him. If so, it be that the white sap is of great value to the lords of the green star, it is still of no value to us, and if the gifts they bring to us are of no value to them, they are dear to us. The plutonian sneered. The earth and the paste of strange dreams. A startled hush fell upon the assembled Maccurians. They looked guiltily at one another, voiding the eyes of the old wise one. What is this? Shrilde, turning furiously to the plutonian. Have he brought the paste of evil to our abode? Knowing well the strict prescription of our tribe? Fool, your death is a pani! But the plutonian only grinned and spread his glistening black hands in a careless gesture. High overhead, peering through the stalactites, all here instantly understood the plutonian strange power. The paste of strange dreams. A fearsome narcotic of that far-sweening dark planet. More insidious and devastating than any drug ever produced on earth, it had brought frightful havoc among many solar races. The earthmen had opened the lanes, broken the age old barriers of distance, so that the heartbees of evil could traffic their poison from planet to planet. So the paste of strange dreams was added to the earthman's burden. Seize him, the evil one! Shrilde, old chief, but the Maccurians, set solid and silent, and the plutonian sneered. Finally one of the chief's arrows, and with an effort faced the old wise one and said, the strange dreams are dear to us than all else. The was he says, the piping voice is rose in eager acclamation, but the old wise one held up his claws, waiting until silence returned. Wait, wait, before he commit this folly, here the green star man. Many times as he demanded audience, let him come in. It is not permitted. The mirrored one of the chiefs. He permitted this being of evil to enter, let him enter also. He is a neoter-chamers now, one of the guards spoke. His face is like the center of a ring storm. Let him enter. Moronus strode into the room angrily, blinded by the fire after the darkness of the anti-chamers, he did not at first see the plutonian. He strode up to the ancient chief and glared at him. As the old wise one learned wisdom at last, he grasped, the ancient shrank away from him as did the near of the lesser chiefs. The old wise one thinks less of his wisdom, he replied weirdly. Behold, he pointed to the enthroned plutonian. Moronus started, his hand flashed to his side and came away empty, deafed fingers had extracted his right tube. But he was a man of courage, never could it be said to his shame that an earthman cringed in the sight of lesser races. So, it's you my study friend, he snarled in English. The plutonian accomplished the linguist, replied, as you see. You don't look very happy, Mr. Moronus. Moronus regarded him impassively, his eyes frosty. Well, that explains everything, he said it last with cold deliberation, first Samus, then boy'd, going to finish me next I suppose. The plutonian twisted the end of an eyebrow and smiled. Interested in them? What did you do with the bodies? The plutonian jerked his thumb careless late. The river you call the blue is swift and deep, but before you follow them, there is certain information I wish to get from you. Where is the soldier who came to visit you? A crafty light came into Moronus's face. He is not far from here, waiting for me. A layer in his cramped hiding place could not help feeling a warm glow of admiration for Moronus's nerve, because Moronus thought him well on his way to earth. Nargo, what did your master do with the visitor? Throw him back to the green star, Nargo said promptly. And the oxygen tanks. Did you empty them? I let them hiss. Nargo's grin was sharkish. News to you, Amaronus. Your officers corpse is probably dropped into the sun by this time. Tell me, why did you drive him off? Moronus sagged, perceptibly. The gain a little time, he said truthfully. I knew I should be blamed and ruined for life. I didn't know you were here, damn you. I hope to get this mess with the native straightened up before he'd come back with reinforcements. Yes, well, you owe some months of life already. Your presence here has been more or less embarrassing, but I had to let you live, or I'd have had the whole IFP here to investigate. Now that you've failed in keeping them from getting interested, you may do me one more service, the Black Giant Grind. I've often wondered that the Earthman's prestige all over the solar system. Even tonight, softened helpless as you are, these natives fear you. You will, therefore, be an object lesson in the helplessness of Earthmen. Moronus was pale but courageous. As it contempt in every line of him, he watched some of the less frightened chiefs, at the command of the plutonian, push aside some of the blazing blocks of fungus on the stone to make room for his body. At last, he raised his hand. For Agvalk, he cried, if you do this thing, the lords of the green star will come. They will come with fires hotter than the sun. They will blast your rivers with a power greater than thunder of the ringstorms. They will fill your caves with a purple smoke that turns your bones to water. Shriil cries of fear almost round out as words. All the marcurians had seen evidences of the dreadful power of the Earthman. They began milling around, then stood rooted by the roar of the plutonian's voice. Lies! Lies, he bellowed. See they are weak as egglets. He stepped down, picked Moronus up by one shoulder, and held him dangling high over the heads of all. Moronus clawed in toward the brawny arm. He made a ludicrous picture. Soon as simple natives made a sniffling sound of Earth, and the plutonian satisfied it last, set him down again. He tells truth. The old wise one had climbed to the top of the stone block. The lords of the green star have their power not in their bodies, but it is great. It is greater far than the frogfolk. It is greater than the lords of the outer orbit. Today will come even as the surly one has said, and great shall be our sorrow. It is not yet too late, release him, and deliver to him the white sap. Seas this evil one. The feeble fickle minds were being swayed again. In August of impatience, the plutonian stepped down, sees the age achieved skinny body in his great black hands, and snapped him in two. There was a tearing of tough cords and tissue, and the two halves fell into the fire. For an instant, the marcurians were stunned. Then some of them vented hissing sounds of rage, while others prostrated themselves on the floor. The black giant watched them narrowly for a moment, then turned his attention to Moronus. He seized him by the arm and drew him slowly and irresistibly to him. The murder of the old wise one had been done so quickly that O'Lyer was unable to prevent it. Had he been able to use his ray weapon, he could have burned the plutonian down, but it had been bent at one of the narrow turns of the crevice he had come down. The need for extreme lightness in weapons was rather overdone in those early times, and the little rough handling made them useless. So now O'Lyer, weaponless except for the service knife at his belt, began a hazardous undertaking of climbing among the stalactites to a position, approximately above the plutonians head. The job required judgment. Some of the stone masses were insecurely anchored and would crash down at the lightest touch, somewhere space so closely together that he could not get between them. Others were so far apart that it was difficult to get from one to another. Yet he made it somehow and unnoticed for all eyes were turned on the tense drama being enacted below. From almost directly overhead he saw Moronus being drawn upward. You saw the plutonian was saying triumphantly in Mercury and you saw me unmake your old fool and now you will see that a Lord of the Green Star is even softer even weaker. Moronus in that pittilous grasp turned his face to the hateful grinning visage above him. In his last extremity he was still angry. You devil Moronus shouted, you may murder me but I'll get you, they'll get you. Oh get me! The plutonian purged silkyly, deferring the pleasure of the kill for another moment. Moronus was having trouble with his breathing. His red face lulled from side to side his eyes rolled in agony. Suddenly he saw a deer, unbelieving he relaxed. I'm seeing things he breathed. Who will get me persisted the plutonian applying a little more pressure? The IFP Moronus gasped. He was a little son of a gun, earlier thought and then he jumped. He landed a straddle the neck of the plutonian which was almost like forky-a-horse. One brony arm seized the horn. The other with a lightning swift dart brought the point of the long surface knife to the pulsing black throat. Put him down, a deer spoke into the great point of the deer. Easy, back on his feet, Moronus began bellowing at the macurians. Utterly, the more lies, they fled Palmel. Moronus came back. He said, nothing to tie him up with. Now that's all right, Oliar replied, studiously keeping the knife point at exactly the right place. I'll ride him in, get going you and be tactful when you go through the door, or this sticker of mine might slip. With extreme care the plutonian did exactly as Oliar ordered him to. It was necessary to radio for one of the larger patrol ships to take Oliar's enormous prisoner back to Earth for his trial. The officer testified, of course, and the plutonian was duly sentenced to death for the murder of the old Macurian. Execution by dehydration was decreed so that the body would be uningered for scientific study. And today it is considered one of the finest specimens extant. In his testimony, however, Oliar so minimized his own connection with the case that he received no public recognition. It was not until some months afterward, when Moronus, on leave, rode back with a shipload of transit scene that the whole story came out. And fatally and profanely, Oliar finally consented to speak a few words for the telephoto news company. As he stepped off the little platform, differential hands tried to push him back. You haven't told them who you are, got tested the announcer. Give your name and rank. Ah, then on after know that, Oliar rejoined, keeping ungoing. They know it's one of the force. That's all they have to know. Besides, there's a blackjack game going on, and I'm losing money every minute and I'm out of it.

Short Story Collection Vol 084,Various,145394,3.0,"February 15, 2020",[],0,"sit liprovox.org. The apparition of Mrs. Veel. This thing is so rare in all its circumstances and on so good authority that my reading and conversation have not given me anything like it. It is fit to gratify the most ingenious and serious inquirer. Mrs. Bargrew is the person to whom Mrs. Veel appeared after her death. She is my intimate friend and I can about for her reputation for these 15 or 16 years on my own knowledge and I can confirm the good character she had from her youth to the time of my acquaintance. Though since this relation she is columny-ated by some people that are friends to the brother of Mrs. Veel who appeared, who think the relation of this appearance to be a reflection and endeavour what they can to blast Mrs. Bargrew's reputation and to allow the story out of continents. But by the circumstances thereof and the true Buddhist position of Mrs. Bargrew, notwithstanding the ill usage of a very wicked husband, there is not yet the least sign of rejection in her face. Nor did I ever hear her lead for a desponding or murmuring expression. Nay not when actually under her husband's barbarity which I have been a witness to and several other persons of undoubted reputation. Now you must know Mrs. Veel was a maiden gentlewoman of about 30 years of age and for some years past have been troubled with fits which were perceived coming on her by her going off from her discourse very abruptly to some impurgidence. She was maintained by an early brother and kept his house in Dover. She was a very pious woman and her brother a very sober man to all appearance. But now he does all he can to null and to wash the story. Mrs. Veel was intimately acquainted with Mrs. Bargrew from her childhood. Mrs. Veel's circumstances were then mean her father did not take care of his children as he ought so that they were exposed to her hardships. And Mrs. Bargrew in those days had as unkind of father, though she wanted neither for food nor clothing. While Mrs. Veel wanted for both. In so much that she would often say, Mrs. Bargrew, you are not only the best but the only friend I have in the world, and no circumstance of life shall ever dissolve my friendship. They would often condol each other's adverse fortunes and read together, drilling call to upon death and other good books, and so like two Christian friends, they comforted each other under their sorrow. Sometime after Mr. Veel's friends got him a place in the custom house at Dover, which occasioned Mrs. Veel by little and little to fall off from her intimacy with Mrs. Bargrew. Though there was never any such thing as a quarrel. But an indifference he came on by Gegrees, tell at last Mrs. Bargrew had not seen her in two years and a half. Though above a 12 month of the time, Mrs. Bargrew has been absent from Dover, and this last half year has been in Canterbury about two months of the time, dwelling in a house at her own. In this house, on the 8th of September, 1,75, she was sitting alone in the forno, thinking over her unfortunate life, and arguing herself into a due resignation to Providence, though her condition seemed hard. And, suchly, I have been provided for her two, and doubt not, but I shall be still, and I will satisfy that my affliction shall end when it is most fit for me. And then took up her sewing work, which she had no sooner done, but she hears a knocking at the door. She went to see who was there, and this proved to be Mrs. Veel, her old friend, who was in a riding habit. At that moment of time, the clock struck 12 at noon. Madame, said Mrs. Bargrew, I am surprised to see you, you have been so long a stranger. But told her she was glad to see her and offered to salute her, which Mrs. Veel complied with, so their lips almost touched, and then Mrs. Veel drew her hand across her own eyes and said, I am not very well, and so waived it. She told Mrs. Bargrew, she was going a journey, and had a great mind to see her first. But, said Mrs. Bargrew, how can you take the journey alone? I am amazed at it, because I know you have a fond brother. Oh, said Mrs. Veel, I gave my brother the slip, and came away because I had so great desire to see you before I took my journey. So Mrs. Bargrew went in with her, into another room, within the first, and Mrs. Veel sat her down in an elbow chair, in which Mrs. Bargrew was sitting when she heard Mrs. Veel knock. Then, said Mrs. Veel, my dear friend, I am come to and you are old friendship again, and take your pardon for my breach of it, and if you can forgive me, you are the best of women. Oh, said Mrs. Bargrew, do not mention such a thing, I have not had an uneasy thought about it. What did you think of me? Says Mrs. Veel. Says Mrs. Bargrew, I thought you were like the rest of the world, and that prosperity have made you forget yourself and me. Then, Mrs. Veel reminded Mrs. Bargrew of the many friendly offices she did her in former days, and much of the conversation they had with each other, in the times of their adversity, and what book so wrote, and what comfort in particular they received from Jelinkort's book of death, which was the best she said on the subject ever wrote. She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock and two Dutch books, which were translated, wrote upon death and several others, but Jelinkort, she said, had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject. Then she asked Mrs. Bargrew whether she had Jelinkort. She said, yes, says Mrs. Veel, fetch it, and so Mrs. Bargrew goes upstairs and brings it down. Says Mrs. Veel, dear Mrs. Bargrew, if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body, which had seen numbers of angels about us for our guard. The notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is. A sterile court says, therefore, be comforted under your afflictions and believe that your mighty has a particular regard to you, and that your afflictions are marks of God's favor, and when they have done the business they are sent for, they shall be removed from you. And to believe me, my dear friend, believe what I say to you, one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings. For I can never believe, and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness which, indeed, ran through most of her discourse. That ever God will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state. But be assured that your affliction shall leave you, or you then, in a short time. She spaken up pathetic over and heavenly manner that Mrs. Bargrew wet several times, she was so deeply affected with it. Then Mrs. Fiel mentioned Dr. Kendrick's Affetted, at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive questions. Their pattern she recommended to her imitation and said, their conversation was not like this of our age. For now, says she, there is nothing but vain, frothy discourse, which is far different from theirs. There's was to edification, and to build one another up in faith, so that they would not, as we are, nor are we as they were. But, such you, we ought to do as they did. There was a hearty friendship among them, but where is it now to be found? Sisemesis Bargrew, it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days, Sisemesis Fiel, Mr. Norris has a fine copy of verse is called friendship in perfection, which I wonderfully admire. Have you seen the book, Sisemesis Fiel? No, Sisemesis Bargrew. But I have the verses of my own writing out. Have you, Sisemesis Fiel? Then fetch them. Which she did from above stairs and offered them to Mrs. Fiel to read, who refused to waive the things saying, holding down her head would make it aint. And then desiring Mrs. Bargrew to read them to her, which she did. As they were admiring friendship, Mrs. Fiel said, do Mrs. Bargrew, I shall love you forever. In these verses there is twice used the word, Elysian. Ah, sent Mrs. Fiel. These poets have such names for heaven. She would often draw her hand across her own eyes and say, Mrs. Bargrew, do you not think I am mightily impaired by my fits? No, Mrs. Bargrew. I think you look as well as ever I knew you. After this discourse, which the apparition put in much finer words, Mrs. Bargrew said, she could pretend to do, and as much more than she can remember, for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters conversation could all be retained, though the main of it, she thinks she does. She said to Mrs. Bargrew, she would have her right a letter to her brother and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such, and that there was a person of gold in her cabinet, and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin Watson. Talking at this rate, Mrs. Bargrew thought that a fit was coming upon her, and so placed herself on a chair just before her knees to keep her from falling to the ground, if her fits should a pageant it. For the elbow chair, she thought, would keep her from falling on either side, and to divert Mrs. Veal, as she thought, to cold of her gownsly several times and commended it. Mrs. Veal told her it was a scoured silk and newly made up, but for all this Mrs. Veal persisted in her request and told Mrs. Bargrew, she must not deny her, and she would have her tell her brother, or their conversation when she had the opportunity. Do Mrs. Veal said Mrs. Bargrew, this seems so impurgent that I cannot tell how to comply with it, and what a modified story will our conversation be to a young gentleman. Why, says Mrs. Bargrew, it is much better than things to do it yourself. No, Mrs. Veal. Though it seems impurgent and true now, you will see more reasons for it hereafter. Mrs. Bargrew then to satisfy her imputunity was going to fetch a pen and ink, but Mrs. Veal said, let it alone now, but do it when I am gone, but you must be sure to do it, which was one of the last things she enjoyed her at parting, and so she promised her, then Mrs. Veal asked for Mrs. Bargrew's daughter, she said she was not home. But if you have a mind to see her, said Mrs. Bargrew, I'll send for her, do, said Mrs. Veal, on which she left her and went to an abyss to see her, and by the time Mrs. Bargrew was returning, Mrs. Veal was got without the door in the street. In the face of the beast market on a Saturday, which is market day, and stood ready to part, as soon as Mrs. Bargrew came to her. She asked her why she was in such haste, she said she must be going, but perhaps she might not go her journey, till Monday, and told Mrs. Bargrew, she hoped she would see her again at her cousin Watson's before she went with as she was going, then she said she would take her leave off her, and walked from Mrs. Bargrew in her view to the turning into her up to the sight of her, which was three quarters after one in the afternoon. Mrs. Veal died the seventh of September at 12 o'clock at noon, of her fits, and not above four hours senses before her death, in which time she received the sacrament. The next day after Mrs. Veal's appearance being Sunday, Mrs. Bargrew was mightal in disposed with a cold and sore throat, and she could not go out that day, but on Monday morning she sends a person to capture Watson's to know if Mrs. Veal was there. They wondered if Mrs. Bargrew's inquiry and sent her work she was not there nor was expected. At this hour, Mrs. Bargrew told the maid, she had certainly missed up the name or made some blunder. And though she was ill, she put on her hood and went herself to capture Watson's, though she knew none of the family, to see if Mrs. Veal was there or not. They said they wondered at her asking, for that she had not been in town. They were sure if she had, she would have been there. Since Mrs. Bargrew, I am sure she was with me on Saturday almost two hours. They sent it was impossible, but they must have seen her if she had. In comes Captain Watson, while they were in dispute, and said that Mrs. Veal was certainly dead, and the discussions were making. This strangely surprised Mrs. Bargrew, when she sent to the person immediately, who had the care of them and found it true. Then she related the whole story to Captain Watson's family, and what Gouchy had on and how strifeed, and that Mrs. Veal told her that it was scoured. Then Mrs. Watson cried out, you have seen her indeed for none you, but Mrs. Veal and myself, but the gown was scoured. And Mrs. Watson owned that she described the gown exactly, for, said she, I helped her to make it up. Then Mrs. Watson blaze all about the town, and debouched the demonstration of truth that Mrs. Bargrew's seeing, Mrs. Veal's apparition. And Captain Watson carried two gentlemen immediately to Mrs. Bargrew's house to hear the relation from her own mouth. And when it spread so fast that gentlemen and persons of quality, the judicious and skeptical part of the world, flopped in and upon her, it had last became such a task that she was forced to go out of the way. For they were in general extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing, and plainly sold up Mrs. Bargrew was no hyper-conjure, but she always appears with such a cheerful air and pleasing mean that she has gained the favor and esteem of all the gentry, and it is thought a great favor if they can back at the relation from her own mouth. I should have told you before that Mrs. Veal told Mrs. Bargrew the testister and brother-in-law were just come down from London to see her. Said Mrs. Bargrew, how came you to order matters so strangely? He could not be helped, said Mrs. Veal, and her brother-in-sister did come to see her, and entered the town of Dover Justice Mrs. Veal was expiring. Mrs. Bargrew asked her whether she would drink some tea. Says Mrs. Veal, I do not care if I do, but I will warrant you this mad fellow, meaning Mrs. Bargrew's husband has broke all your trinkets, but, says Mrs. Bargrew, I'll get something to drink in for all that, but Mrs. Veal waived it and said, it is no matter, let it alone, and so it passed. All the time I sat with Mrs. Bargrew, which was some hours, she recollected fresh stains of Mrs. Veal, and one material thing more, she told Mrs. Bargrew, that old Mr. Bracken allowed Mrs. Veal 10 pounds a year, which was a secret, and unknown to Mrs. Bargrew, till Mrs. Veal told her. Mrs. Bargrew never varies in her story, rich puzzles so to doubt of the truth or are unwilling to believe it. As certain in the neighbours, Yarder joining Mrs. Bargrew's house, her chair talking to somebody an hour, of the time Mrs. Veal was with her. Mrs. Bargrew went out to her next neighbours, the very moment she parted with Mrs. Veal, and told her what ravishing conversation she had had with an old friend, and told the whole of it. Drilling courts book of death is, since this happened, bought up strangely, and it is to be observed that notwithstanding all the trouble and fatigue Mrs. Bargrew was undergone upon this account. She never took the value of her father, nor suffered her daughter to take anything of anybody, and therefore can have no interest in telling this story. But Mr. Veal does what he can to start with a matter, and said he would see Mrs. Bargrew, but yet it is certain matter of fact that he has been a captain Watson since a death of his sister, and yet never went near Mrs. Bargrew. And some of his friends report her to be a liar, and that she knew of Mr. Bracken's 10 pounds a year. But the person who pretends to say so has the reputation to be an notorious liar among persons who might know to be of unouthing to credit. Now Mr. Veal is more of a gentleman than to say she lies, but says her bad husband has quazed her, but she needs only presenter self and it will effectively compute that presence. Mr. Veal says he asked his sister on her deathbed, whether she had a mind to dispose of anything, and she said no. Now the things which Mrs. Veal's apparition would have disposed of was so trifling, and nothing of injustice aimed at the disposal that the design of it appears to me to be early in order to make Mrs. Bargrew satisfied the world of the reality they are all. As to what she had seen and heard, and to pursue her reputation among the reason the blunner-understanding part of mankind. And then again, Mr. Veal owns that there was a person of gold, that it was not found in her cabinet, but in her comb box. This looks improbable. For that Mrs. Watson owned that Mrs. Veal was so very careful of the key of her cabinet, that she would trust nobody with it, and if so no doubt she would not trust her gold out of it. And Mrs. Veal's often drawing her hands over her eyes and asking Mrs. Bargrew whether her fits her notting paired her. Looks to me, as if she did it on purpose to remind Mrs. Bargrew of her fits. To prepare her not to think it's strange that she should put her upon writing to her brother to dispose of rings and gold, which looks so much like a dying person's request. And it took, accordingly, with Mrs. Bargrew, as the effect of her fits coming upon her, and was one of the many instances of her wonderful love to her and care of her, that she should not be afraid it, which you do, appears in her whole management, particularly in her coming to her in the daytime, waving the salutation, and when she was alone, and then the man of her parting to prevent a second attempt to salute her. Now, why Mr. Veal should think this relational reflection, as it is plain he does, by his endeavouring to ciphole it, I cannot imagine, because the general of the belief her to be a good spirit, her discourse was so heavenly. Her two-boy carrots were to comfort Mrs. Bargrew in her affection, and to ask her forgiveness for her breach of friendship, and with a pious discourse to encourage her. So that, after all, to suppose that Mrs. Bargrew could hatch such an invention as this, from Friday noon to Saturday noon, supposing that she knew of Mrs. Veal's death the very first moment, without jongling circumstances and without any interest, too, she must be more witty, fortunate, and wicked, too, than any indifferent person I dare say, will allow. I asked Mrs. Bargrew several times if she was sure she felt the gown. She answered modestly, if my senses be to be relied on, I am sure of it. I asked her if she heard a sound when she clapped her hand upon her knee. She said she did not remember she did, but said she appeared to be as much as substance as I did who talked with her. And I may, said she, be as soon persuaded that your apparition is talking to me now, as the tide did not really see her. For I was under no manner of fear and received to as a friend, and parted with her as such, I would not, said she, give one further thing to make anyone believe it. I have no interest in it. Nothing but trouble is entailed upon me for a long time, for all time, no, and had it not come to light by accident, it would never have been made public. But now she says she will make her own private use of it, and keep herself out of the way as much as she can, and so she has done since. She says she had a gentleman who came 30 miles to her to hear the relation, and that she had told it to a room full of people at the time. Several particular gentlemen have had the story for Mrs. Bargrew's own mouth. This thing has very much affected me, and I am as well satisfied as I am of the best grounded matter of that. And why we should dispute matter of that, because we cannot solve things of which we can have no certain or demonstrative notions, seem strange to me. Mrs. Bargrew's authority and sincerity alone would have been undapted in any other case, and of the apparition of Mrs. Video.

The Art of War (Neville Translation),Niccolò Machiavelli,87399,11.0,"August 21, 2020",[],0,"nformation or to volunteer, visit librevox.org. Recording by Clive Caterral. Preface by Niccolo Macchiivali, citizen and secretary of Florence, on the books on the Art of War, to Lorenzo de Philippe Stratzi, a gentleman of Florence. Many Lorenzo have held and still hold the opinion that there is nothing which has less in common with another, and that is so dissimilar, as civilian life is from the military. At once, he is often observed, if anyone designs to avail himself of an enlistment in the army, that he soon changes, not only his clothes, but also his customs, his habits, his voice. And in the presence of any civilian custom, he goes to pieces. For I do not believe that any man can dress in civilian clothes, who wants to be quick and ready for any violence. Nor can that man have civilian customs and habits, who judges those customs to be a feminine, and those habits not conducive to his actions. Nor does it seem right to him to maintain his ordinary appearance and voice, who, with his beard and cursing, wants to make other men afraid. Which makes such an opinion in these times to be very true. But if they should consider the ancient institutions, they would not find matter more united, more in conformity, and which of necessity should be like to each other as much as these civilian and military. For, in all the arts that are established in society for the sake of a common good of men, all those institutions created to make people live in fear of the laws and of God would be in vain if their defense had not been provided for. And which, if well arranged, will maintain not only these, but also those that are not well established. And so, on the contrary, good institutions without the help of the military are not much differently disordered than the habitation of a superb and regal palace. Which even though adorned with jewels and gold, if it is not roofed over, will not have anything to protect it from the rain. And if, in any other institutions of a city or of a republic, every diligence employed in keeping men loyal, peaceful, and full of fear of God, it is doubled in the military. For in what man ought the country to look for greater loyalty than in that man who has promised to die for her. In whom ought that be a greater love of peace than in him who can only be injured by war? In whom ought that to be a greater fear of God than in him who undergoing infinite dangers every day, has more need of his aid? If these necessities informing the life of the soldier are well considered, they are found to be praised by those who gave the laws to the commanders, and by those who are put in charge of the military training, and followed and imitated with all diligence by others. But because military institutions have become completely corrupt and far removed from the ancient ways, these sinister opinions have a reason, which make the military hated, and in order to cause with those who train them avoided. And I, judging by what I have seen and read, that it is not impossible to restore it ancient ways, and return some form of past virtue to it. I have decided not to let this leisure time of mine pass without doing something. To write what I know of the art of war, to the satisfaction of those who are lovers of the ancient deeds. Although it requires courage to treat of those matters of which others have made a profession, nonetheless, I do not believe that it is a mistake to occupy a position with words, which may with greater presumption have been occupied with deeds. For the errors which I should make in writing can be corrected without injurating anyone. But those which are made with deeds cannot be found out except by the ruin of the commanders. You Lorenzo will therefore consider the quality of these efforts of mine, and will give in your judgment of them that sent you a praise, which will appear to you to be mirited. I send you these as much to show myself grateful for all the benefits I have received from you, although I will not include in them the review of this work of mine. As well as also because being accustomed to on a similar works of those who shine because of their ability wealth, genius and liberality. I know you do not have many equals in wealth and ability, few in ingenuity, and no one in liberality.

Totem poles are a dime a dozen, north of 63 degrees, but only catch the lying eskimo, vowed that they dropped out of the frigid northern skies. Soler's stiff. By Charles A. Stofer. Voxercordings. Fobo's five gazed at the white expanse ahead, trying to determine where his ship would crash. Something was haywire in the fuel system of his inner star run about. He was losing altitude fast. So fast that all five pairs of his eyes couldn't focus on a place to land. Five pairs of arms. Each pair about three feet apart on the log-like body. Pushed buttons and rotated controls frantically. But to no avail. In a few short minutes, it would be all over for Fobo's five. Even if by some miracle, he remained unheard after crafting. He would die shortly thereafter. The frigid climatic conditions of the third planet were deadly to Maccurians. He thought once of donning his face suit, but decided against it. That would merely prolong the agony. From planet three, when one has a smashed space cruiser, there is no return. Fobo's five knew that death was writing with him in the helpless ship. The situation did not necessarily dismay him. Mercurians are philosophers. Fobo's five ceased to manipulate the unresponding controls. Stretching his trunk-like torso to its full 20 feet. Four heads gazed through observation ports at the four points of the compass. While the remaining head, delcitorally, watched the instrument panel. Since die he must, Fobo's five would meet his hands stoically. And five pairs of stumpy arms folded over five chests in a coordinated gesture of resignation. Fobo's five thought fleetingly of his wife, Lingua four, and remembered with some annoyance that she was the author of his present predicament. A social primer, Fobo's five thought to himself, but aside from that a good wife and mother, in addition to being a reigning beauty. Lingua four was tall even for a mehkirian. Already, she had scaled seven dregs, or in earth terms, 14 feet, and was beginning to show evidence of a fifth head. Five heads were rarely found on females, and Fobo's five was justly proud of his good fortune. In all mercury, at the present time, he knew of but two females possessing five heads. And soon Lingua four would be a third of her sex to be thus endowed. Yes, thought Fobo's five, a woman to be proud of. For today, after three varks of marriage, the memory of her thin trunk with four pairs of eyes laughing misgiviously, filled his five brains with flame. Slim was a birch she stood in his memory, and eight eyes whispered lover's thoughts across space and time. Fobo's five recalled his five minds from their nostalgic reverie, and gazed at the contour of the earth that was rushing up to meet him. White, blazing white, reflecting the rays of the midnight sun covering the region as far as he could reach. Good, thought Fobo's five, the polar regions. That means the end will come quickly. One or two seconds, at the most, of that bitter cold, would be enough. Turning away from the windows, Fobo's five let his thoughts return to Lingua four to Fobo's two his son, and his home on the first planet from the sun. Ah, that is the place to live, Fobo's. The temperature is an unchanging 327 degrees, just comfortably warm, where one can enjoy a life of warmth and ease. Too bad that he would not live to see it again. Thirty varks he reflected is such a short life. With luck, perhaps he would have lived to see a hundred varks lit by, and perhaps in time he would have added three more heads, and five grugs in length to his towering trunk. He thought of Fobo's two, and wondered idly if his son would also visit the barbarian worlds to collect data for Lingua four. He wished that he could have seen more of Fobo's two. That's an up-and-coming lad he thought. Not quite too far exult and too heads already. Yes indeed, he's quite a boy Fobo's five remembered proudly. Maybe his mother will keep him at home instead of running him all over the universe to get material for her committees. He wished that Lingua four would settle down and be content as a housewife, but he doubted that she would. Social ambition was boring like a termite under her bark. Lingua four was determined to be the first lady of arbor, the capital city of Mercury. To this end, Lingua four had labored unsheacingly. She was president of half the women's clubs on arbor. She could always be dependent upon to furnish the best in new and diverting subjects. She had it almost all the committees for aid or research on any type of problem. It was owing to Lingua four being president of the committee for under-nourished arborians that Fobo's five was making this ill-starred trip. His purpose was to capture a few of the upright divided trunk animals that inhabited the third planet. They were to be transported to Mercury and given over to scientific study as to their edible qualities. If it were found that the divided trunk creatures were fit for Mercury and Consumption, the problem of under-nourishment would no longer exist. Since the supply of divided trunk was seemingly inexhaustible. Mercharians had made expeditions to the third planet before, and every report concluded with, divided trunk creatures increasing in number. Privately, Fobo's five doubted the possibility of using the divided trunk's for food since the last expedition once again reported a complete lack of captives due to the frail and tenuous bodies of the divided trunk. Then, too, transportation and preservation opposed a tremendous problem, not to mention the difficulty of trying to eat something that might vaporize on your fork. But then these questions may never arise, he decided, for of all the reports peruse by Fobo's five, not one expedition had succeeded in bringing a divided trunk to Mercury. All reports were read to the last letter by Fobo's five before assembling equipment for his own trip. In the reports he had noted many of the difficulties of the earlier missions. Planet 3 was impossible for Mercharians without a heated space suit. The temperature of the planet was so low that it would literally freeze a Mercharians' stiff in a matter of seconds. The casualties on the early expeditions had been numerous. Many Mercharians had succumbed to the bitter cold due to flaws in space suits and other accidents. A break in the suit meant instant death. The victims of such mishaps were invariably buried in the isolated, sparsely inhabited polar region, to avoid alarming the divided trunk creatures. It was strange, Mused Fobo's five, that the divided trunk were seemingly unable to bear the slightest increase in temperature. Their bodies disintegrated upon contact with a Mercharian. Some were roped and dragged from a distance up to the doors of the spaceship. But no one habitant of Planet 3 had been closer to Mercury than the airlock of the space cruiser. As the divided trunk people were dragged into the airlock, warm air from the ship would be pumped into the lock to dispel the frigid air of Planet 3. As the warmth of Mercury enveloped the divided trunk, they became quite red, began to melt, and finally dissolved into a gaseous state, leaving a small pile of ashes, and a disagreeable odor in the airlock that sometimes lingered for days. Fobo's five believed that he had a solution for these obstacles in the path of scientific study of the divided trunk. He had decided to use a gile in place of strength. For this reason he had come alone and in a small space run about to put his solution to the test. But his solution now could never be tried, he remembered merosely. In the Afghan Department, Fobo's five had constructed a refrigeration plant. By maintaining a constant degree of frigidity, he hoped to deliver a pair of each species of divided trunks to Mercury. He hoped, especially, to capture a complete set, and perhaps a few over to make up for breakage and losses. As to what form of subsistence the divided trunks were accustomed to, he had no idea whatsoever. He had intended to bring samples of earth, vegetation, and anything else that might have suggested a source of food for the divided trunks. The thought too had occurred to him that possibly the divided trunk creatures ate one another. On the possibility of this, Fobo's five had determined to capture three black ones, three white ones, three yellow ones, three browns and three reds, and three of any other color he might find. He rather doubted that more colors or combination of colors existed. All previous expedition reports had mentioned only the five colors. However, Fobo's five had determined to keep several eyes open on the off-chance that he might find a new and different species. His refrigerator was modeled along the architectural lines of the dens of the divided trunks. The main room of the refrigerator, open to the outside of the ship by means of a small airlock. A mercarian size airlock was not needed for the divided trunks, as few had been found to be much over three dregs and hikes. Winches and cables to pull the divided trunks into the refrigerator were installed in the refrigerator room itself to avoid burning the divided trunks with hot cables from other parts of the ship. In addition, Fobo's five had cunningly devised a refrigerated trap. This too was designed to simulate the caves of the divided trunk creatures, but was smaller. It was constructed with entrances, readily seen, and exits well hidden. Fobo's five had expected great things from his trap. He had conceived of the idea after reading the report of a mercarian expedition that explored the dens of the divided trunks at some placed marked Coney Island. According to the reports, the divided trunks showed no hesitancy in entering these types of dens. In fact, the writer of the report gave it as his opinion that the divided ones perhaps played games in these sorts of caves. It also mentioned that some of the dens were equipped with flat, shiny surfaces that cast reflections or images. Fobo's five had incorporated the image-making surfaces into his trap design. A pity that all this effort might be wasted thought, Fobo's, as he once more turned to the observation port to check his remaining distance from the planet's surface. Seeing that his time was short, Fobo's five turned all five faces forward in the mercarian gesture of disdain for death. A moment later came the shock. A week later, the proprietor of a novelty shop in Fairbanks watched two natives with their dog team pulling something long like through the snow toward the trading post. Turning to a customer he remarked. Here comes catch an ockoo dragon another totem pole. Guess that catch must be the biggest liar ever produced by the Eskimos. He tried to tell me that totem poles fall from the sky. Says he can always find one when he sees it fall because it's so hot it melts the snow around it. Personally, I think he should be elected president of the Liars Club, but I'll buy the totem pole anyway. Those pesky tourists always whittle a chunk out of my totem pole for a souvenir. I'm glad he's bringing me another one, the storekeeper concluded. The one he sold me last year is about whittled away. The end of solar stiff by Charles A.

The day had been full of excitement as bi-emersiful ordinance last days usually are. The final packing had been done. The chests and boxes securely fastened and carefully labelled. This was all looked after by Margaret herself amidst interruptions by a brood of young children. Visits from friends and relatives living at a distance occupied much of the day, attending to countless minor things kept them all busy until nightfall. Even then, there was no time allowed to visit the shrine. Margaret had a fairy shrine to which she carried the cares of the day and the hopes of the maro. This charmed place was a style over the ivy-clad walls of the garden. There she brought her childish joys and sorrows and in the quiet received consolation. She had fought the fiercest battles of her womanhood with her head resting against the ivy-cullard pillar. Tonight, when she was partying from her country and friends, there was no time to commune with her silent friend. Shortly after dusk, in accordance with local etiquette, very stringent on such momentous occasions, the relatives, friends and neighbors of a lifetime began to drop in by two's and threes until every inch of wall space was filled. Who of all this gathering was more welcome than John the Fiddler. He was a great favorite with young and old, a sight of him carrying his fiddle, caused a feeling of emotion in the hearts of the older people. He recalled the tragic story of John's father, who years before left for America, intending to send for his wife and crippled son. A fever contracted on shipboard to prive them of a husband and father. It was then that John Doyle became John the Fiddler. John was beckoned into the room, where with father or carnal and a few trusted friends, he was treated to a small measure of puchin. Dan Monahan had donated a very small jug for this special occasion. To be given the first shot from Dan Stil was no small favor, as those present knew. Before taking a seed at the end of the room, John drank Margaret's health, wishing herself and family a safe voyage across the water, and a happy home on the prairies of Iowa. Each guest realized the strain of parting and generously made an effort to conceal the gloom with a brave semblance of birth. There was dancing, singing of songs, and elaborate drinking of health. With persistent cause for Margaret's brother James, the dancing stopped. The floor was cleared, and he was born in on the shoulders of the leaders who had found him leaning against the ivy covered wall, gazing at the moon, floating over his old home which, a last, he would never see again. James McNaven was a magnificent specimen of Irish manhood, and a charming singer. He was about 23 years old, tall, and broad shouldered, and a fine head of curly, arbon hair. His clear blue eyes reflected the sadness of the group around him, while his white teeth flashed a smile. In one hand, he crushed his hand, cachif. While with the other, he never sleet world a sprig of ivy. A few measures of good night and joy be with you all, came from the vile in. For an instant, he wavered, then throwing back his head, he sang the song, not with full volume, but with intense feeling emphasis, and a clear ringing tone. The song seemed to voice his own feelings as his chest rose and fell. He was no longer just James McNaven, but a pilgrim travelling to a strange country. His whole soul was filled with a sentiment, and there was such pathos in its heart throng at the whole company was moved to tears. The last verse ended. He stood a moment with Gaze Transfixed, and rousing himself bowled, smiled, and with one hand in his system, Margaret's, the other clutching the sprig of ivy, he passed out of the home, forever.

Bob 1901, Assistant editor of the Daily Quarmasi, left the office, crossed the road, and entered the college yard by the simple expedient of placing one hand on the fence and vaulting over upon the forbidden grass. Cobb held a Latin book under one arm. For even if one laborers on a college paper to mold undergraduate opinion, he is not exempt from a certain amount of class attendance and carried an open letter in his hand. His round, good-natured face were a broad grin, and whenever he looked at the letter, his grin increased. He entered the first entrance to Gray's Hall, bound it up two flights of narrow stairway, and pounded at a door. An invitation to enter came faintly through two thicknesses of oak, and Cobb confronted the single occupant of the room. How are you, Barkley? Thanks, note, can't stop. Just drop round to leave this with you. Got it in this morning's mail at the office. Said to myself, just one man and college will take interest in this. That's Barkley. So I brought it to you. My answer today. Good idea. Seems to me. Hope you'll be able to do something about it. Bye. And Cobb grinning like a jovial satter was gone. Barkley, 99, laid his panicide with slow deliberateness, marked his place in the big Greek lexicon beside him, and took up the letter. It was addressed to the editor of the Quarmasi, and was signed, Hiram G. Larkin, Yale, 99. The writer asked to be put in communication with some student in the rival college who was interested in checkers. He dwelt enthusiastically on the formation of a dual chucker league. He pointed out the fact that although chess, wished, and other games of skill and science were recognized and participated in each year, by teams representing the two universities, the noble game of checkers had been here to, woefully neglected. He suggested that teams be formed at each university, and that a tournament be played to decide the championship. When Barkley laid aside the letter, his long and aesthetic face held an expression of enthusiastic delight. The one dissipation and hobby of Barkley's studious existence was checkers. He held a college ride reputation as a grind of the most prominent type. Barkley did not look down on the usual pleasures and frollocks of the undergraduate. They simply had for him no appeal. He had nothing against football or baseball or track athletics, but he felt no enthusiasm for any of them. Of course he was always glad when the college teams won. He was patriotic to a high degree, and sometimes when the bonfires burned and the students cheered and sang, he acknowledged a wish, lying deep down in his heart that he too might be able to derive pleasurable emotions from such celebrations. Barkley, in short, loves an orphanies and xenophon, and next to them, checkers. Before he went to bid that night, he answered the Aile Man's letter, endorsed the project biluminously, pledged immediate cooperation, and remained fraternally his, Simonide's, P. Barkley. I have no intention of specifying in detail the steps which resulted in the formation of the intercollegiate checkers association. Barkley and Larkin wrote to each other at least every other day, and at the end of three weeks the matter was settled, not perhaps just as they had hoped for. Barkley had labored herrically to find a membership for the checkers club, but without a veil. None wanted to join, many scoffed, and instead of enthusiasm, he awakened only ridicule, and the Aile Man reported like results. So when the rival teams met in a private room in Young's Hotel, one December day, they consisted of just Larkin, Yale 99, and Barkley. The tournament was held behind tightly closed doors. Consequently, I am unable to report the play for the reader's benefit, enough the deep silence and undoubtedly skill held sway until dusk, at which time the two teams passed into the dining hall and ate a dinner, at which much good feeling was displayed by both, and at which day's play was rehearsed scientifically, from oysters to coffee. The teams then shook hands and parted at the entrance. Barkley boarded a car and returned to college, filled with overwhelming triumph. He won three out of the seven games and drawn two, the checkers championship rested with Harvard. Such a spirit of jubilation possessed Barkley that when he reached his unadorn room and had changed his goal rimmed glasses for his reading spectacles, he found that Greek for once did not satisfy. He tried light reading in the form of a monograph on the origin of Greek drama, but even then his attention wandered continually. He laid down the book, wiped his glasses thoughtfully, and frowned at the green lampshade. Plainly something was wrong, but what? He pondered deeply for several minutes. Then his brow cleared and he settled his specs over his lean nose again, he had found the trouble. The victory, said Barkley, soberly to the lambshade, demands a celebration. The more he thought of it, the more evident it appeared that the days triumphed over the Yale checkers club deserved some sort of a public jubilee. He might, considered Barkley, put his head out of the window and sheer, but he wasn't sure that he knew how, or he might shoot off a robber. If he had one, or he might start a bonfire. Ah, that was it, a bonfire. The idea appealed strongly to him, and he remembered that as a boy on a new hamster farm, bonfires had ever moved him strangely. He rose and thrust his feet into a pair of immense overshoes, tied a muffler about his long neck, dawned his worn-olster, turned down the lamp, and passed out of the room. Yes, he would celebrate with a bonfire. A victory over Yale at checkers was quite as important, and Barkley's estimation, as a triumph over the blue-stucking football warriors. Fifteen minutes later a window at the upper end of the college yard was slammed open, and a voice spalled into the frosty night. Hits out, or hits out! Then up and down the quadrangle, casements were raised, and broad beams of light glowed out into the gloom, while dozens of other voices passed on, slogan, Hits out, fellows, hits out! What's up? Crater thin voice from an upper window, a flare, bonfire in front of university was the answer. Bonfire in the yard, or hits out, sped a cry. Everybody get wood! Shout it a voice from weld! Everybody get wood! Shout it half a hundred other voices. Then windows were shut, and eager youths clatter down stairs into the yard, and suddenly the quiet night had become a pandemonium. In front of university hall, alone figure fed, with shingles and odd bits of wood, a small bonfire, which cast this one glow against the white front of the silver pile, as if dismayed at its own tomorrity. For bonfires in the yard, a strictly forbidden, and it was many years before the last one had sent its sparks up in front of university. Parkly knew this, and welcomed the danger of probation, or dismissal, as adding an appropriate touch of the grand and heroic to his celebration. Everybody get wood! What's it for? Rha for the bonfire? Who's doing it? Wood would get wood fellows? One of the first to reach the scene was Cobb 1901, a dozen others were close behind him. Hello, what's up? What we celebrating? He asked breathlessly, then he quad a glimpse of the thin despactical visage of Barkley and gasped. Why? Why it's so Barkley? Rha for Barkley, old grind, shouted another. He's the stuff. Everybody get wood. At that moment a worn out hencoop arrived suddenly on the scene, and a shower sparks told that the fire was gaming courage. But say, old man, what's it all about? Ask the Cobb. We're celebrating a victory over Yale. Answered Barkley soberly, as he adjusted a plank with his foot. There was no undue excitement exhibited by this tall figure in the long-alster, but underneath his calm, the blood-raced madly through his veins, and a strange and well-nine uncontrollable joy possessed him as the flames lead higher and higher. He stooped and picked a brand from the edge of the fire. He waved at the race about his head, sending the flaring sparks over the ever-increasing crowd. Paray, he yelled, inquire on canytones. Rha, rha, rha, answer the throng. Everybody get wood. But what did we do to him? Ask Cobb wonderingly, what's the victory? One the checker championship. Answered Barkley proudly. A roar of laughter went up. Fellowes fell on their neighbors next, and giggled hysterically. A football man sat down in the fire and had to be rescued by his friends. Cobb hugged Barkley and padded him on the back. Good home, Barkley. He gurgled. Oh, good home, Barkley. One the checker's champ, champ, champ. Oh dear, oh dear. Somebody hit me before I. I. More wood, bold, someone. Rha, for Barkley, the champion, checkerist. Everybody chair for Barkley. And everybody did. Many, many times. More wood leaped from out the darkness and fell upon the flaming heap, which now rose to the fellow's shoulders and crackled right merrily. The vicinity of the bonfire was black with yelling laughing students. And every moment their number grew. As the light was seen at distant dormitories, or the shouting was heard across the avenue. Speech cried the throng. Speech, speech. And Barkley was quickly elevated to the shoulders of Cobb and another. And from there spoke feelingly of the inception and growth of the checker's club, of the tournament and of the victory. Very few heard all that speech, for it was cheered andcessantly, and those at the edge of the crowd yelled, who's the fellow that's talking? What do you know? It's Dui. No, it's at that moment. Someone started a song and by common impulse the students formed in line and began the circuit of the yard. Barkley on the shoulders of the two riotous friends leading the procession. The rice around they went, singing the college songs, cheering on every provocation, clasping arms and swinging ecstatically from side to side, and raising such an uproar as the old college had not often heard. The most gorgeous bonfire since we won the boat race, panted his senior at the end of the parade, and the biggest celebration. But I'd like jolly well to know what it's for. Join hands was the cry, and soon three rings of dancing striding youths were circling the fire. Their fantastic shadows leaping her testically across the front of the buildings. And just when the phrylic was at its height, and the fire was crackling more joyously than ever, just when the quiet winter stars were harkening for the 50th time to the horse cheers in honor of Barkley. The dean and three professors walked into the circle of radiance, and the throng melted as if by magic until Barkley, spectacleous, hatless, but exultant was left standing alone by his bonfire. Mr. Barkley said the dean pleasantly, will you kindly call on me tomorrow? I think we'll let the matter drop, said the dean next day, hiding a smile under an affected frown, if you will promise Mr. Barkley to indulge yourself in no more the dean's voice failed him, and he swallowed spasmatically, twice, before he found it again. No more celebrations of victory. And Barkley, very remorseful and chaseless this morning, promised, and hurried off to his beloved Greek. Both Barkley and the Yale Cheekers Club graduated from their respective universities the following spring, and consequently, the intercollegiate cheekers association died. But although, go on, it was not forgotten, and Barkley's bonfire is still spoken of as the most gorgeous thing that ever happened.

The Thousand Quilt from Rebecca Mary by Annie Hamilton Donnell. Good afternoon, Rebecca Mary said politely. The Minister's wife was cutting little trousers out of big ones. The Minister's big ones. It was the old puzzle of how to steer clear of the thin places. Policed gross sewed side tenderly the Minister's wife over her work. She had not heard the voice from the doorway. Good afternoon again. It was a quaint little figure in tight red calico standing there. It might easily have stepped down from some old picture on the wall. Rebecca Mary had a bundle in her arms. It was so large that it obscured breast and face, and only a pair of grave blue eyes presided over by thin light brows seemed visible to the Minister's wife. The trousers puzzle merged into this one. Now who could? Oh, oh, it's Miss Plummer's little girl Rebecca. She said cordially. Rebecca Mary her niece came a little muffled from behind the great bundle. Rebecca Mary's niece. Oh, you mean Miss Plummer's niece, and your whole name is that. But I suppose she calls you Rebecca or Becky for short. Walk in Rebecca. But Rebecca Mary was struggling with the paralyzing vision of Aunt Olivia calling her Becky. She had passed by the lesser wonder of being called Rebecca without the Mary. Oh, no, I'm indeed Aunt Olivia never shortens me, gently gasped the child. And the Minister's wife measuring from the bundle down smiled to herself. There did not seem much room for shortening. But walk in dear, you are going to walk in. I hope you have come to make me a little call. Rebecca Mary struggled out of her paralysis. Here was occasion for new embarrassment. Rebecca Mary was honest. No, I mean not a little call. I've come to spend the afternoon. She said slowly and I've brought my work. The bundle, the great bundle, was her work. She advanced into the room and began carefully to unroll it. It was the turn of the Minister's wife to be paralyzed. She pushed forward a chair and the child sat down in it. It's my thousand quilt that I'm making for Aunt Olivia explained Rebecca Mary. It's most done. There's a thousand pieces in it and I'm on the 991th. I thought probably you'd have some work, so I brought mine. Yes, I see. The Minister's wife stood looking down at the tight little red figure among the gorgeous waves of the thousand quilt. They edged and surged around it in dizzy reds and purples and greens. She was conscious of being a little seasick and forward leaf. She turned back to the puzzle of the little trousers. It had been in her mind at first to express sorrow at roaders being unfortunately away and the boys. Now she was glad she hadn't. For it was quite plain enough that the visitor had not come to spend the afternoon with the Minister's children, but with the Minister's wife. It isn't she that's young, it's I, though the Minister's wife with kind, laughing eyes. She's old enough to be my mother. How old are you dear? She added aloud. Me, I guess you mean Aunt Olivia, don't you? It's Aunt Olivia's birthday on making it for. It's going to be a present. Once she gave me a present on my birthday, once. The Minister's wife remembered roaders birthdays and the boys. Taken all together such a host of little birthdays. But this little old old visitor seemed to have had but one. My birthday is two days quicker than Aunt Olivia's is, volunteered the visitor socially. We're most twins you see. Aunt Olivia was 56 that time she gave me the present. She's going to be 59 when I give her this quilt. It's taken me ever since to make it. The Minister's wife looked up from her cutting. So Rebecca Mary was only 59. It's quite a long quilt side Rebecca Mary, but pride woken her eyes as she gazed out on the splendors of the green on purple sea. A thousand quilts has so many stitches in it, but when you saw them all yourself, when you sew every single stitch. The pride in Rebecca Mary's grave blue eyes grew and grew. Robert, the Minister's wife said that night to the Minister. It's an awful quilt, but you ought to have seen her eyes. It's taken her three years to make it. Maybe you wouldn't be proud yourself. Maybe you wouldn't if road ahead made it. Roader. Robert, she sewed one square of patchwork once and it made her sick. I had to put her to bed. Speaking of once reminds me, once Rebecca Mary had a birthday present. She waited a little anxiously for him to understand. The Minister always understood, but sometimes he made her wait. Felicia, are you trying to make me cry, he said, and she was satisfied. She went across to him as she always did when she wanted to cry herself. The floor was strewn with the tiniest boys, engine and cars, and she remembered as she zigzagged among them that they had been one of his very last birthday presents. It was Robert, what do you think the present was? I'll give you three guesses, but I advise you to guess a rooster. Thomas Jefferson, murmured the Minister, as one who was acquainted. Yes, that is his name. How did you remember? She is very fond of him. He is her intimate friend, she says. So she is under great obligation to her aunt. It's a large quilt, but it's not too large to cover Thomas Jefferson. I'm going to help her by aligning and cotton batting. Cracked corn will make a good lining, but cotton bat. Robert, this is not a comedy. If you'd seen Rebecca Mary and the quilt, you'd call it a tragedy. You couldn't surprise me, any if you told me she'd quilted it for herself. Down the road from Anteluvius Farm, across its southern boundary fence, romped and shattered all day long, the tony trumbles is. No one, except possibly their mother, was quite certain how many of them there were. It was a dizzy process to take their senses. They were never still and little brown bear limbs, nor shrill voices. From sun up to sundown, the tony trumbles is raced and left, certainly they were happy. The Minister's wife had not dared to tell her collar of the afternoon that the Minister's children were down there, shouting and dressing with the little tony trumbles'. Dear no, not after Rebecca Mary in the course of conversation, had said that Anteluvius did not countenance the tony trumbles'. Rebecca Mary did not say countenance, but it meant that. Her aunt won't let her play with them, Robert, and she'd like to, you needn't tell me Rebecca Mary wouldn't like to. I saw it in her poor little solemn eyes. Besides, she said she asked her aunt once to let her. Robert, answer cruel, I never knew it before. They've no business bringing up little Rebecca Mary's. My dear Felicia, but in the Minister's eyes was agreement. Anteluvius took afternoon naps with punctilius regularity, and Olivia herself was punctilius regularity. At half past one day upon day, she hung up the dish towel, hung up her kitchen apron, and walked with unswerving course into her bedroom. There disposed upon the dainty bed in rigid lines of unrest, she rested. The naps were often long ones. A little after the afternoon that Rebecca Mary spent at the Minister's, the birthday quilt was finished. The thousandth tiny piece was neatly over and over to its gorgeous expense. But Rebecca Mary was not content, she long to make it complete. She wanted to surprise Aunt Olivia with it, as Aunt Olivia, on that momentous birthday of her own, had surprised her with a little fluffball of yellow down that had grown into Thomas Jefferson. That had been such a beautiful surprise, but this Aunt Olivia had seen the quilt so many many times. She had taught Rebecca Mary's stiff little fingers to set the first stitches in it. She had made her rip out this purple square and that pink checked one, and this one and that one and that. Oh Aunt Olivia was acquainted with the quilt. It would not be much of a surprise. But Rebecca Mary set her little pointed chin between her little brown palms and pondered, and out of the pondering grew a plan so ambitious and so daring that Rebecca Mary guessed in the throws of it. But she held her ground and entertained it intrepidly. She even grew one friendly terms with it in the end. Here was a way to surprise Aunt Olivia. Rebecca Mary would do it. That it would entail an almost endless amount of work did not daughter. Rebecca Mary was a plumber and plumber is for not to be dunted. The long vista of patient hours of trying labor that the plan opened up before her set her blood tingly, like a warriors on the eve of battle, what were long patient hours to a plumber. Rebecca Mary girded up her loins and went to meet them. Thereafter, an Aunt Olivia's nap times, Rebecca Mary disappeared. Day after day, week upon week, she stole quietly away when the door of Aunt Olivia's bedroom shut. The first time she went oddly loaded down with what would have appeared, if there had been anyone for it to appear, to be a bundle of long sticks. She made two trips into the unknown that first day. The second time the bundle looked much like that one, over which her grave blue eyes had peered at the minister's wife, when she went to spend the afternoon with her. It was spring when the mysterious disappearances began. It was summer before Aunt Olivia woke up, not from her nap, but from her inattention. Quite suddenly she came upon the realization that Rebecca Mary was not about the house, nor about the grounds for she instituted prompt search. She went to all the child's odd little hunts, the grape-ery, the orchard, the cornhouse, even to her own beloved backyard full of sweet-cented hiding nooks dear to a child, but sacred ground to Aunt Olivia. Rebecca Mary sometimes did her stents there as a special privilege. She might be there now unprovelled. Aunt Olivia's backyard was almost as full of flowery delights to Rebecca Mary as it was to Aunt Olivia. The child was not there, not anywhere. Aunt Olivia sought for Thomas Jefferson to inquire of him, but Thomas Jefferson was missing too. She went there rounds again, where could the child be? It was a hot stinging day in late June when Aunt Olivia's suspicions awoke. They had been long in rousing, but once alert, they developed rapidly into certainties. Her pale eyes glistened, her thin nostrils dilated, Aunt Olivia's whole lean, sharp, unemotional person put on suspicion. The child had gone to see the Tony Trumbosis. My land, ejaculated Aunt Olivia, after all my forbidding, and she a plumber. She sat down suddenly as though a little faint. She had never known a plumber to disobey before. It was a new experience. It took time to get used to it, and she sat still a long time, rigid and grim on the edge of the chair. Then, as suddenly as she had sat down, she got up. It could not be. She refused to entertain the suspicion longer. Rebecca Mary had not gone there to that forbidden place. She was in the garden somewhere. Aunt Olivia, a little stiff as if from a chill, went once more in search of the child. Rebecca, Rebecca Mary, she called at regular intervals. Then sharply, Rebecca Mary plumber. Her voice had thin cadences of suspicion lurking in it against its will. But there seemed really no doubt. One by one, incriminating circumstances occurred to Aunt Olivia. Rebecca Mary had long to go so much. The Tony Trumbuses, one at a time, or in a tumultuous body, had urged her so often. She herself had more than once caught the child gazing wistfully, impassing by, at the bewildering, deafening frollocks of the little Tony Trumbuses. Once Rebecca Mary had asked to go barefoot as they went. Once she had let out the tight little braids in her neck and rumpled her thin little hair. Once Aunt Olivia had come upon her plain. The remembrance of it now tightened the lines around Aunt Olivia's lips. The child had been running wildly about the yard, shouting in a strange, excited, ridiculous way. When Aunt Olivia in stern displeasure had demanded explanations, she had run on recklessly, calling back over her shoulder. Don't stop me, I'm a Tony Trumbul. My land breathed Aunt Olivia, taking back the suspicion to her breast. After all my forbidding she's gone down there. She's been going down there, dear knows how long. She's waited till I took my naps and then went, a plumber. There was really nowhere else she could have gone. She had never wanted to go anywhere else, except to the ministers. And Rebecca Mary was prontillious and would not think of going there again, till the minister's wife had returned her visit. But Aunt Olivia waited, as usual she went to her room next day at nap time and closed the door behind her. But when a little figure slipped down the road towards the forbidden place, a moment later she was watching behind her blinds. She was groaning as if in pain. The little figure began to run stately. Aunt Olivia groaned again. The child was in a hurry to get there. She couldn't wait to walk. There was guilt in every motion of the little figure. And she runs like a plumber groaned Aunt Olivia. The next day and the next Aunt Olivia watched behind her blinds. The fourth day she put on her afternoon dress and followed the hurrying little figure. Not at once, Aunt Olivia did not hurry. There was a sad reluctance in every movement. It seemed a terrible thing to be following Rebecca Mary. Rebecca Mary Plumber, to a forbidden place. A far off Aunt Olivia heard faintly the shoutings that always heralded an approach to the Tony Trombosis and shuddered. The tumult kept growing clearer. She thought she detected a wild, excited little shout that might be Rebecca Mary's. Her thin lips set into a stern straight line. A splash of red caught Aunt Olivia's eye as she drew nearer the joyous world of little children. Rebecca Mary wore a little tight red dress. The coil seemed closing in about the child. Close to the southern boundary fence of Aunt Olivia's land stood an old empty barn. It had been a place for storing surplus hay once when there had been surplus hay. For many years now it had been empty. As Aunt Olivia approached it she noticed that it's great sliding door was open. Strange when for so long it had been shut. If that old barn door ain't open breathed Aunt Olivia stopping in her astonishment. I ain't seen it open before in these ten years. Now what I want to know is who opened it? Likely it's not those screeching little wild engines. She strode across the stubby grass ground to the barn and peered into its cooled, into its cooled dim depths. Then Aunt Olivia uttered a little bewildered cry. Gradually the dimness took on light and the whole startling picture within Unfolded itself to her astonished eyes. Rebecca Mary was quilting. She was stooping earnestly over a gay expanse of purples and reds and greens. Her little tight red back was towards Aunt Olivia. It looked bent and strained. Rebecca Mary's eyes were very close to the gay expanse. Suddenly Rebecca Mary began to speak and Aunt Olivia's widened eyes discovered a great white rooster pecking about under the quilt. His big snowy bulk stood out distinct in the shadow of it. I'm glad we're almost through. Aren't you Thomas Jefferson? It's been a pretty long quilt. You get sort of tired when you quilt a long quilt. It makes your back creek when you unbended and when you quilt in a barn, of course you can't see without squinching and it hurts your eyes to squinch. Silence again, except for the industrious peck peck of the Great White Rooster. Aunt Olivia stood very still. You've been a great help Thomas Jefferson began again the voice of Rebecca Mary after a little. I'm very much obliged to you as I've said before. I don't know what I should have done without you. No, you need and dancer. I couldn't hear a word you said. You can't hear with cotton and both of your ears. Rebecca Mary's side. There was no cotton and Aunt Olivia's ears to shut out the soft little sound. But of course you have to wear it in on account of your conscience. It's conscience, cotton, Thomas Jefferson. I've explained before, but I don't know as you understood. It seems a little unpolite to wear it in my ears, with you here keeping me company. I suppose you think it's unsosable. But Aunt Olivia doesn't allow me to associate with the Tony Trombosis. Oh, Thomas Jefferson, I wish she'd allowed me to associate. Aunt Olivia found herself wishing she had conscience cotton in both of her ears. There's such nice cheerful little children. It makes you want to go right over their fence and hollow too. Rebecca Mary pronounced it hollow with careful precision. Aunt Olivia would not approve of holler. And when you can't, you like to listen. But I suppose listening to them hollow would be sociate, so I put the cotton in. The joyous hollowing broke in waves of glee on Aunt Olivia's ear drums. It seemed to be assaulting her heart. Oddly, now it did not sound unmanually and dreadful. It sounded nice and cheerful. A plumber even might be happy like that. Cotton is a very strange, experienced Thomas Jefferson ran on the little voice. At first you most can't stand it, but you get over the worst of it by and by. Besides, we're getting most through now. Aunt that's blended Thomas Jefferson, and it's pretty lucky too because Aunt Olivia's birthday is getting very near. It almost scares me. Doesn't it you? For I don't know how Aunt Olivia looks when she's pleased. You think she'll look pleased, don't you Thomas Jefferson? It's such a long quilt. And when you've sewed every stitch yourself, if Rebecca Mary had turned round then, she would have seen how Aunt Olivia looked when she was pleased. But the little figure at the quilting frame bent steadily to its task, only another soft-sized, stealing it to Aunt Olivia's uncaught and deers. Thomas Jefferson pecked his way towards the open door, and the lean figure there started back giltily. Aunt Olivia did not want to be recognized. You there onto the quilt Thomas Jefferson? The little voice put on tenderness, because I'm going to tell you something. What Aunt Olivia gave me a birthday present, and it was you. Such a little might of a yellow chicken. That's why I make in the quilt for Aunt Olivia. It was three years ago. I've loved you ever since. Added Rebecca Mary simply. For an instant Aunt Olivia stopped being a plumber. A sob crept into her throat. Rebecca, Rebecca Mary, Rebecca Mary plumber, she cried involuntarily. Then she stepped back hastily, glad for the cotton in Rebecca Mary's ears. For the surprise, she must not spoil the child's hard-earned surprise, and besides, Aunt Olivia wanted to be surprised. It was a relief to get away. She could not look any longer at the picture in the great, Cobweb-Eburn. The gorgeous quilts spread out to its full extent. The empty scuffles above Rebecca Mary stooping to her work. Thomas Jefferson pecking about the floor. Aunt Olivia was not old. Through all the years ahead of her, she would remember that picture. She went straight to the southern boundary fence and looked across at the Jubilant Little Tony Trumboses. The one in a red dress like Rebecca Mary's, she singled out with a pointing finger. You, come here, she called. I won't hurt you. No need to look scared. Do you know who I am? I'm Rebecca Mary's Aunt. You know who Rebecca Mary is, don't you? Gracious, shrilled the little red Tony Trumbull, which Aunt Olivia took for yes. Well, then, you know where I live. You see here, I want you all, the whole kid of you to come to my house tomorrow morning to see Rebecca Mary. I'm going to say it over again, tomorrow morning to see Rebecca Mary.

Penny Les and at the end of my supply of the drug was shown, makes life enjoyable, I can wear the torsion no longer, and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalette street below. Do not think for my slavery to morphine, but I am a weakling, or a degenerate. When you have read this Hesley-Scall pages you may ask, though never fully realize, what it is that I must have forgetfulness or death. It was in one of the most open and least frequent at parts of the Bratka Suffec, that the packet of wish I was super cargo philpicked into the German serator. The grey war was then as it very beginning, and the ocean forces at the hunt had not completely sunk to the later degradation. So that our vessel was mineral legitimate prize, whilst we of her crew were treated with old<|translate|> fairness and consideration, due to us as naval prisoners. So liberal indeed was the discipline of our captors, that five days at the river were taken, a minute back into the only gets vaguely by the sun and stars that I was somewhat south of the equator. Of the longitude I knew nothing, and no island or coastline was inside. The weather kept bare, and for on counted days I drifted at aimlessly beneath the scorching sun, waiting for some passing ship or to be cast on the shores of some hattable land. Renew the ship and her land appeared, and I began to despair my solitude upon the heaving vastness of a broken blue. The shamed half-in-wals I slept, is details I shall never know, for my slumber, for the trouble on Jimmie's best it was continuous. When at last I awakened, it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black-mar, which extended about me in mononus on the nations as far as I could see, and in which my boat lay grounded some distance away. The want might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wander at so prodigious and unexpected transformation of scenery. I was in reality more horrified than a sunish, for there was in the air and in the rotten soil, a sinister quality was shielded to the very core. The region was puture with the carcasses of the king fish, and of other lesser-scrabbable things which I saw protruding from the nasty mud of deline and inlaying. Perhaps I should not hope to convey my worst unerable hideousness that can dull in absolute silence and bearing immensity. There was nothing within hearing, and nothing incisive of a vast reshub black slime. Yet the very completeness of the stillness and the homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a nauseating beer. The sun was blazing down from a sky, which seemed to me almost blackness-clawless cruelty, as though reflecting the inky-marshmine of my feet. As I crawl into the stranded boat, I realized that only one theory could explain my position. The so-op-presidentable can of heavell, a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface, exposing regions which for a new-murvil millius of years had laid hidden on their unfathomable water-eat-abs. So great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me, but I could not detect the faintest noise of the certain ocean, stream my ears as I might. No were there any sea-fault to pray upon the dead things. For several hours I set thinking or brooding in the boat, which lay upon its side in a 40th site shade as the sun moved across the heavens. As a day progressed, the ground lost some of its stickiness, and seemed likely to drive sufficiently for traveling purposes in a short time. That nios-left booklettle, and the next day I made for myself a pack-contained food or water, report to a twin-overland journey in search of the vanishing sea and possible rescue. In the third morning, I found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease, the order of the fish was maddening, but I was too much concerned with grave-rethinks to mine's slight eneval, and set out boldly for an unknown goal. All day I forced steadily westward, guided by a faraway hammock which was higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert. That nigh encamped on the following days still travel toward the hammock, though that objects seemed scarcely nearer that when I had first spided. By the fourth evening, I attained the base of the mound, which turned out to be much higher than it had appear from a distance, an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface. Two words was sent, I slept in the shadow of the hill. I not not what my germs were so wild at night, but era the waning of fantastically give us moon-hat risen problem of the eastern plain. I was awake in a cold perspiration, determined to sleep no more. Sliced visions as I had experienced were too much for me to endure again, and in the glow of the moon, I saw how long wise I had been to travel by day. Without the glare of the partial sun, my journey would have cost me less energy. Indeed, I now felt quite able to perform the asset which had to turn me at sunset. Beking up my pack, I started for the crest of the eminence. I had said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a source of big horror to me, but I think my horror was greater when I gained the summit of the mound, and looked down to the other side into the measurable pit of canyon, whose black pieces as the moon-hat not yet sore high enough to illuminate. I felt myself in the edge of the world, peeing over the room into a fathomless chaos of eternal night. Through my terror and curious reminiscence of paradise-thlaws, and Satan's hideous climb through the impassioned realm of darkness. As the moon-clump higher in the sky, I began to see that the slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as I had imagined. Legislature and our croppins of rock afforded fairly easy footholds for the scent. Whilst after a drop of a few hundred feet, the declivity became very gradual. Urge unbanned impulse which I cannot definitively analyze, as scramble with difficulty on the rocks, and student-genthler so beneath, gazing into the stejan dips where no light had yet penetrated. All at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the opposite slope, which rose steeply about a hundred yards ahead of me, an object that gleam lightly in the newly-wrestled race of the ascending moon. But I was merely a gigantic piece of stone, I soon as shurned myself, but I was conscious of a distinct impression that as contora and position were not all together the work of nature. A closest-cruity filled me with disincessions I cannot express. For the spite it's enormous magnitude, and its position in the bist which had yon at the bottom of the sea, since their world was shone, I perceived the young and out that the string to object was a well-shipped monola, whose massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of living and thinking creatures. The peace and frighten, yet not with other certain thrill of the scientists or archaeologists delight, I examine my surroundings more closely. The moon, now near the center, shall wearily unbevely above the towering steeps that hem in the chasm, and reveal the fact that a far-flung body of water flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions, and almost slapping my feet as I stood on the slope. I crossed the chasm, the wavelengths washed the base of the cyclopian monolith, on whose surface I could not trace both inscriptions and curved sculptures. The writing was in a system of hierarchical effects unknown to me, and unlike anything I had ever seen in books, because the system for the most part of conventional lies, aquatic symbols, such as fishes, eels, octopi, crustaceans, mollus, wells, and the like. Several characters obviously were a percent-emoreen things which are unknown to the monorworld, but whose decomposing forms I had at serve on the ocean-risen plane. It was pictorial carving however that didn't most to hold me spellbound. Plainly visible across the intervening water or account of their enormous size was an array of vast reliefs whose subjects would have excited the envy of a door. I think that these things were supposed to depict men, at least a certain sort of men. The creatures were shorn, distorting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto, or paying home as some monolithic shrine, which appeared to be under the waves as well. Of their faces and forms I bet not speaking detail. For the marine membranists mixed me growth pain. Grataspian, the imagination of a poe or a bullwerp. They were undoubtedly human in general, eye-laught, despite webtans and feet, shuckingly wide and fluffy lips, glossy, boldly nines, and other features less pleasant to recall. Curiously enough, they seem to have been chiseled badly at a portion with their scenic background. For one of the creatures was shown in the act of killing a well we presented as but little large in the himself. I remarked, as I say, there were tests as in strange size, but in a moment decided that there were merely the imaginary gods of some primitive fishing or seafaring tribe. Some tribe whose land's descendant led a parish era's before the first ancestor of the plilled down or near the full moon was born. Astrock at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologists, I stood musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel before me. Then suddenly I saw it, with only a slight turning to market's rise to the surface, the thing flint into view above the dark waters, vast polyphemous, like a loathsome. It'd darla like a stupidness monster of nightmares in the monolith, about wish-if-longest agente scale arms. The wall it bowed is hideous head and gave them to certain measure sounds I think I wouldn't madden. Of my frantic at the sound of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat, I remember little. I believe I sang a great deal, and laughed oddly when I was unable to sing. I have in the stick recollection of a great storm, sometime after reached the boat. At any rate, I knew that I had heard peels of thunder, and other tones for Schnee'sure utteres only in her wildest moods. When I came out of the shadows, I was in the sounds for in Cisco Hospital, brought to you there by the captain of the American ship, which had picked up my boat in mid-Ocean. In my delirium, I had sent much, but found that my words have been given scan attention. Of any land of evil in the Pacific, my rescuer's new nothing, with that I didn't necessarily have to insist upon a thing which I knew they could not believe. Once I sought out a celebrated ethnologist, and I'm using my peculiar questions regarding the ancient ghosting legend of the Gondon, the fish god, but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional, I did not press my increase. It has at night, especially when the moon is given us in waning, that I see the thing. I try more pain, but the drug has given only transient surces, and has drumming to his clutches as the hopes of slave. So now I am to end it all. Having written enough for the account for the information that content to some amusement of my fellow men, often I asked myself it could not have been a pure phantasm, a mere freak of fever as I lend sun-stricken and raving, and they opened both after my escape from the German Man of War. This I asked myself, but ever does there come before me, a hideously vivid vision and reply, I cannot think of the deep sea without shattering at the nameless things that may at the spring moment be crawling and flundering on its slam you that, worshiping their ancient stone idols and carving their own the testable likeness on stuttering, obelisk, or water-sope granite. I dream of a day when they may arise above the villas to drag down their reaking talents that were a mness of puny, war-accessant mankind of a day when the land shall sink and the dark ocean floor shall ascend a misuniversal pen the moanum. The end is near. I hear a nose at the door and I'm so immense a slippery body lumbering against it. It shall not find me. God that hand, the window, the window.

Dracula (version 5),Bram Stoker,52219,3.0,"December 17, 2020",[],0,"oker, chapter 1, Jonathan Harcos Journal, Chapter 1 of the first of May, arriving at Vienna early next morning. Should have arrived at 646, at train was an hour late. Budapest seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which I had got away from the train, and a little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station as we had arrived late, and would start as near as the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the west and entering the east. The most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble widths and depths, took as among the traditions of Turkish rule. We left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to close in book. Here I stopped for the light at the hotel Royal. I had dinner or rather supper, a chicken fell up in some way with red pepper, which is very good but thirsty. Men get recipe for men. I asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika handle, and that it was a national dish. I should be able to get it anywhere along the Kepathia. I found my smattering of German very useful here indeed. I don't know how I should be able to get on without it. Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I visited the British Museum and made certain among the books and maps in the library, regarding Transylvania, who had struck me that some foreign knowledge of the country could hardly fall to have some importance, in dealing with a noble man of that country. I find that the district key to the name is in the extreme east of the country, just on the ballers of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia, and Book of Vina. In the midst of the Kepathia mountains, one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe, I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the castle Dracula. And as there are no maps of this country, as yet to compare with our own honour and survey maps, I found that, by the way, the post town name by Count Dracula, is a fairly well known place. I shall enter here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory, while I talk over my travels with Mina. In the population of Transylvania, there are four distinct nationalities, Saxons in the south, and mixed with them the Wallocks, who are the descendants of the Dysians, Megas in the West, as there's left these in the eastern north. I'm a guy among the latter, they're inclined to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Megas conquered the country in the 11th century, they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Kepathian. As if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool. If so, my stay may be very interesting. Men must ask the Count all about them. I did not sleep well, and my bed was comfortable enough for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog harring all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it. It may have been a paprika for I had to drink up all the water in my caraf, and was still very thirsty. Towards morning I slept, and was awakened by the continuous knocking up my door, so I guessed I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and sort of porridge of myesfly, which they said was memolega, and eggplants stuffed with force meat, very excellent dish, which they call, Implotata, men, get this recipe also. I had to hurry breakfast for the train started a little before I, or rather an author of Dunso, after rushing to the station at 730, had to sit in the carriage for more than a hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go, the more unpuncial other trains, one ought they to be in China. What day long we seem to doodle through a country which is full of beauty of every kind? Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills, such as we see in old missiles. Sometimes we ran by rivers and streams, which seem for the wide stony margin on each side of them, be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of a tire, some of them were just like the peasants at home, or those I saw coming through France and Germany. The short jackets and round hats and homemade trousers. But others were very picturesque, the women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves and some kinder or another, and most of them had big belts with lots of strips of something fluttering from them, like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petty coats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cowboy hats, great baggy dirty white trousers, white linen inserts and enormous heavy leather belts, any of foot-wide, all studded over with brass nails. There were high boots with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair, and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look pre-possessing. On the stage they would be sit down at once, as some old-awaitable band of brigands. They are, however, I've told, very harmless, and rather wanting in natural self-assertion. It was on the dark side of Troylo, when we got to bistris, which is a very interesting old-place, being practically on the frontier, for the borego past leads from it into Book of Vina. It has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows the marks of it. Fifteen years ago a series of great fires took place, which my terrible habit on five separate occasions. Very beginning of the 17th century, it underwent a siege of three weeks, and lost 13,000 people. The casualties of war, proper being assisted by famine, and disease. Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Crone of Hotel, which I found in my great delight to be thoroughly old-fashioned. For of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected for when I got near the door, face the cherry looking elderly woman in the usual present dress, white under garment with long double apron front and back. I've coloured staff fitting almost two types for modestly. And I thank Closcibeld and said, the hair Englishman. Yes, I said, Jonathan Harker. She smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in a white shirt sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter. My friend, welcome to the Capatians. I'm actually expecting you to sleep well tonight. At three tomorrow, the diligence will start for Book of Vina. A place in it is kept for you. At the ball-go past, my carriage will await you, and will bring you to me. I trust that you're journey from London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay, my beautiful land. Your friend Dracula. Fourth of May, I felt that my landlord has gone a letter from the Count, and I'm directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me. But on making inquiries as the details, he seemed somewhat redressome, and pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly. At least he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady, had received me. Look to each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in the letter, and that was all he knew. What I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, I could tell me anything of his castle, but he and his wife crossed themselves, and saying that they knew nothing at all. Simply refuse to speak further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask anyone else. For it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting. Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my moon and said in a very hysterical way. Must you go or we young hair must you go? She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know of at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her, I must go at once, and then I was engaged on important business. She asked her to go, Do you know what day it is? I answered that it was the fourth of May. She shook her head as she said the game. Oh yes, I know that. I know that, but do you know what day it is? I'm not saying that I do not understand. She went on. It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that tonight when the clock strikes midnight? All the evil things in the world will have full sway. Do you know where you are going or what you are going to? She was in such an evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on knees, and it applauded me not to go. At least a way to die at whom before starting. It was not very ridiculous, but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. By therefore, I tried to raise her up, and said as gravely as I could. But that I think, but my duty was imperative, that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck. Offer it to me. I can know what to do. For as an English churchman, I have been taught to regard such things. As in some measure, my daughters. And yet it seems so ungracious to refuse an old lady, meaning so well in such a state of mind. She saw I suppose the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck and say, for your mother's say, and went out of the room. I'm writing up this part of the diary, whilst I'm waiting for the coach, which is of course late, and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly traditions in this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know. But I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book shall ever reach me in a before-eye, do, let it bring my good by. Here comes the coach. Fifth of May, the castle. The grey of the morning has passed, the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills that I know not. For it is so far off that big things are little and mixed. I am not sleepy, and as I am not to be called till I awake. Naturally I write till sleep comes. For many odd things to put down, and let who reads that may fancy that I dined, too well before I left the streets. Let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they call robber steak. Bit of bacon, onion and beef, season with red pepper, and strong on sticks, and roasted over the fire. In the simple style of the London Academy, that's me. The wine was a golden modeash, which produces a questing on the tongue, which is however not disagreeable. I only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else. When I got along the coach, the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with a landlady, and were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door, which they called by an eye, meaning word bearer, came and listened and looked at me, most of them pity me. I could hear all the words often repeat it, clear words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my polygot dictionary from my bag, and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, amongst them were Ordog, Satan, or Col, Hell, Stregoyca, Witch, Rolok and Vulkursack, both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak, the other Serbian, for something that is either where well, for vampire, men, I must ask the count about these superstitions. When we started, the crowd ran the end door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross, and pointed two fingers towards me. The sum difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant. He would have answered it first, while I'm learning that I was English, she explained, that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place, to meet an unknown man, but everyone seems so kind-hearted and so sorrowful, so sympathetic, but it could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse of which I had of the end yard, and it's crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oil and oil, orange-treesing green tubs, clustered in the centre of the yard. An adriver whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxed, got soly called them, racked his big whip over the four small horses, which ran a breast to me set off on our journey. I still am not so it, and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along. While I had known the language or rather languages, which my fellow passengers were speaking, I might not be able to throw them off so easily, before as I agreed sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills crowned with clumps of trees. With farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere above the wilderness, massive fruit blossom, apple plum, pear, cherry, and as we drove by, I could see the green grass under the trees, spangled with the fallen petals, in and out amongst these green hills, what they call here, middle land, ran the road. Losing itself as it swept around the grass he curved, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillside like tunnels of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bed on losing no time in reaching Borgo, Prun. I was told that this road had summertime is excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general rail of rose in the Capatheans. For it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of the old hosped ours, would not repair them. Less the turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point. Beyond the green swelling hills of the middle land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steepest of the Capatheans themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them, and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown were grass and rock wrinkled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed cracks. To these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty riffs in the mountains, through which as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. On a mic Companion touched my arm as we swept around the base of a hill, and opened up the lofty snow covered people around them, which seemed as we wound on our second time way to be right before us. Look, it stands Zek, God's seat, and he crossed himself reverently, as we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the Union began to creep around us. This was emphasized by the fact that the snowy mountain top still held the sunset, as he could glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed checks and slowbacks, all in picture-rescutter, but I noticed that the gluteal was painfully present, by the roadside with many crosses, as we swept by my companions all cross themselves, here and there was a peasant man or woman, kneeling before a shrine, that did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion, to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me for instance, hyrics in the trees, and here and there, very beautiful masses of weeping birch, there white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now in a game you pass the lighter bag, the ordinary peasant's cart, with its long slate-like vertebrae calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated, a group of homecoming peasants, the checks were their white and the slowbacks with their coloured sheep skins, but latter carrying lans fashioned their long staves with accident. Thus the evening fell, it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistyness, the gloom of the trees, oak, beech and pine. Now in the valleys which were end-deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the past, the dark fur stood out here and there again, so the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes as a road was cut through the pine, once seemed in the darkness, to be closing down upon us, great masses of grainers, which here and there but strewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts of grim fancies in gendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset, through into strange relief, the ghost-like clouds, which amongst the caeparsians, seemed to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our driver's haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wish to get down and walk up them as we do that home, but the driver would not hear it, no no he said, must not walk here, the dogs are too fierce, and then he added with what he evidently meant for grim placentry, or a look round, to capture the approving smile of the rest, and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep. The only stop he would make was a moment pause to light his lamps. When it grew dark, there seemed to be some excitement among the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after another, as they were urging him to further speed. He lashed his horses unmercifully, with his long whip, with wild cries of encouragement, urged him on to further exertions. Then through the darkness, I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there was a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater, the crazy coach rocked on his great leather springs, who swayed like a boat-tost on a stormy sea, I had to hold on. The road grew more level than they appeared to fly along. Then the mountain seemed to come nearer to us on each side, and a frowned down upon us, we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness, which would take no denial. These were certainly of an odd and very kind, but each was given a simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing and that strange mixture of fair meaning movements, which I'd seen outside the hotel at Bistris. The sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye, then as we flew along the driver leaned forward, on an each side, the passengers craning over the edge of the coach, passed eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected. But the way our speech passage and no one would give me the slightest explanation, the state of excitement kept on for some little time, and at last we saw before us the pass opening out onto the eastern side, who were dark, rolling clouds over head, and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and now we had got into the sunsourous one. I was now myself looking out for the conviance, which was to take me to the count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness, but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the stream from our heart of an horse is rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was no sign of a vehicle. The passages drew back with the sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I'd best do, when the driver looking at his watch, said to the other something which I could hardly hear, he was spoken so quietly, and so lower tone. I thought it was an hour less than the time. And then turning to me, he said in German, worse than my home, there's no courage here, the hair is not expected after all. He will now come on to book a vignor, and return tomorrow over the next day, better the next day. While he was speaking, the horses began to nae, and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up, then amongst the course it screamed from the peasants, and the universal crossing of themselves, a calleesh with four horses drove up behind us. Over took us and drew up beside the coach, like it's seen from the flesh of our lamps, as the race fell on them, but the horses were cold black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, the long brown beard, and a great black hat, but seemed to hide his face. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, but seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us, he said to the driver, you are only tonight, my friend, a man stammered in reply, the hair English is in a hurry, to which the stranger replied, that is why I suppose, you wish them to go on to book a vignor, you cannot deceive me, my friend, I know too much, and my horses are swift, as he spoke his smile, an lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouse, with very red lips, and sharpling teeth as white as ivory, one of my companions, whispered to another, the line from Burgers Lea-Nor, Dendi-Culton-Lighten-Schnell, for the dead travel fast, strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile, the passage of turn just face away at the same time, putting out his two fingers and crossing himself, give me the hair's love each, said the driver, I'm exceeding a lacquerty, my bags were handed out, and put in the callesh, and I descended from the side of the coat, as the callesh was close up alongside, the driver helping me with the hand, which caught my arm in a grip of steel, whose strength must have been prodigious, without a word he shook his reins, the horses turn, and we swept into the darkness of the past. A wild howling began, that seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination can grasp it through the glow of the night, at the first how the horses began to strain and rhea, the driver spoke to him soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from a sudden fright, and far off in the distance, from the mountains and each side of us, he got a louder and sharper howling, that of wolves, which affected both the horses, and myself in the same way, but I was minded to jump from the callesh and run, while saying, rear to gain and plunge madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes over, my own ear has got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet, that the driver was able to descend and stand before them. He petded and soothing them, and whispered something in their ears, as I've heard of horse tame as do we. And with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they become quite manageable again, though they still trembled, the driver gained a seat and shaking his reins started off in a great pace. This time after going to the far side of the pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway, which ran sharply to the right. Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places, arched right over the roadway, to be passed as though through a tunnel. And again, great frowning rocks, guarders boldly all either side. Now, in the resheld to we could hear the rising wind, rip mound and whistle through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crash together as we swept along. He could cold and cold us still, find powdery snow be out of thought, so the soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, and the screw fainter as we went all our way, but being of the bulls sounded narrow and narrow, as though they were closing on us from every side. I could dreadfully afraid, and the horse is shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed. He kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness. Suddenly a while in the left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment. He at once checked the horses, and jumped into the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less the howling of the wool-school closer. But while I wondered, the driver suddenly appeared again, without a word took his seat and he resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, seemed to be repeated endlessly. And now looking back, it's like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near to the road, and even in the darkness around us, I could watch the driver's emotions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame rose, must have been very fight for it did not seem to elume and replace around it at all. In gathering a few stones, fallen them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect, when he stood in between me and the flame, did not obstruct it, and then he said, it's ghostly flicker all the same. It startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me, straining through the darkness. Then for a time, there were no blue flames, and we spread on the through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as although we're following in a moving circle. Last that came a time when the driver went further afield and the horse was began to tremble, worse than ever at a snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves, see salt together, but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beatling pine cloud rock, and by a slight I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongue, with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. There were a hundred times more terrible in the great silence, which held them and even when they held. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man fills himself face to face, with such horrors, and he understands they're true in port. Once the wolves were then to hell, as other moon light had some peculiar effect on him. The horses jumped about and reared and looked helplessly brown with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see, but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side, and they had before us to remain within it. I called out to the coach for him to come for it, seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the callesh, hoping that by the noise to scare the wolves on that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know not. But I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperialist command, looking towards the sound, saw him standing the road away, as he swept his long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still, just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness. When I could see a guy in the driver was climbing into the callesh, and the wolves had disappeared. This was also strange in uncanny, the dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak on the moon. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds, obscured the moon. We kept on ascending with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly I could then conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a glass of blooming castle, for whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and his broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.

Dr. Greensleyad theorizes That evening, I remember as it came up through the Mill Middle. I was feeling particularly happy and contented. It was still mid-march, one of those spring days when noon is like May, and the only cold, pearly-hease, at sunset, warns a man that he's not done with winter. For season was absurdly early, where the black-forn was in flower in the hedge roots, where full of promroses, the parture trees were paired, the ropes were there as well, with their nests, and the meadows were full of shimmering grey flocks of field fairs on their way north. I put up a half a dozen snipe on the baldy edge of the stream, and in the bracket, in stern wood, I thought I saw a woodcock. It hoped that the birds might nest with us this year, as they used to do so long ago. It was jolly to see the world coming to life again, and to remember that this patch of England was my own, and all these wild things, so to speak, members of my little household. As I say, I was in a very contented mood, for I found something I had longed for all my days. I had bought Fosse Muneer just after the war as a wedding present for Mary. And after two and a half years, we had been settled there. My son, Peter John, was rising 15 months, a thoughtful infant, as healthy as a young quote, in his comment as a terrier puppy. Even Mary's anxious eye could scarcely detect in him any symptoms of decline, where the place wanted a lot of looking to. For it had run wild during the war, and the woods had to be fined, dates, and fences repaired, new drains laid, a rampant into supplement the wells, a heap of fatching to be done, and the garden borders to be brought back to cultivation. I had got through the worst of it, and as I came out of the home one, on the lower lawns, and saw the old stone gables that the monks had built. I felt that I was anchored at last, in the pleasantest kind of arbor. There was a pile of letters on the table on the hall, where I left them be. For I was not in the mood for any communication with the outer world. As I was having a hot bath, Mary kept giving me the news through her bedroom door. Peter John had been raising gain over her first tooth. The new short-worn cow was dried off, old George Wadden had got his granddaughter back from service. There was a new brood of runner ducks, and there was a missile-thrush building in the box hedge by the lake. A crownacle of small beer, you will say, but I was by a long-tuck, more interested in it, and in what might be happening in parlament or Russia or the Hindu Kush. In fact, I was becoming such a mossback, that I had almost stopped reading the papers. Many a day, the times would remain unopened. For Mary never looked at anything, but the first page to see who was dead or married. Not that I didn't read a lot. For I used to spend my evenings digging into county history, and learning all I could about the old fellows that had been my predecessors. I liked to think that I had lived in a place that had been continuously inhabited for a thousand years. Cavalier and round-tend had fought over the countryside, and it was becoming a considerable authority on their tiny battles. That was about the only interest I had left in soldering. As we went downstairs, I remember we stopped to look out the long staircase window, which showed a segment of lawn. Quarter of the lake, and through a gap in the woods of vista of Green Downland. Mary squeezed my arm, what a blessed country, she said, Dick, did you ever dream of such peace? We're lucky lucky people. And suddenly her face changed in that way she has a good very grave. I felt a shiver of on a longer arm. It's too good and beloved to last, she whispered. Sometimes I'm afraid. No, I'm not saying I left. What's going to upset it? I don't believe in being afraid of happiness. I knew very well, of course, that Mary couldn't be afraid of anything. She left too. All the same I've got what the Great called out of. You don't know what that means. You'll savage. It means that you feel you must walk humbly and delicately to appropriate the fates. I wish I knew how. She walked too delicately, where she missed the last step in our descent and did an undignified shuffle right into the arms of Dr. Green Slade. Paddock, I had got Paddock back after the war, and he was now my butler. Was helping the doctor out of his usler. And I saw by the saddest by the look on the ladder space that he was through his days work and meant to stay to dinner. Here I better introduce Tom Green Slade. For all my recent acquaintances, he was one I had most taken to. He was a long lean fellow with a stoop. He just backed from bending over the handles of motor bicycles. With better share and greedy blue eyes and freckled skin that often accompanied that of his hair. From his high cheekbones and his coloring, you would have set him down as a Scottsman. But as a matter of fact, he came from Devon Shire, X-Mor. I think though he had been so much about the world that he had almost forgotten where he was raised. I had traveled a bit, but nothing to Green Slade. He had started as a doctor in a way of worship, then he had been in South Africa war and afterwards a temporary magistrate up Lyndon Bergway. He soon tired of that and was for a long spell in Uganda and German East where he became a rather swell on tropical diseases nearly perished through experimenting on himself with fancy inoculations. Then he was in South America where he had a good practice involved Peracio and then in the melee states where he made a bit of money in the rubber boom. There was a gap with three years after that he was wandering in Central Asia, partly with a fellow called Ducklet, exploring through Northern Mongolia and partly in Chinese Tibet hunting for new flowers for he was mad about botany. He came home in the summer of 1914, meaning to do some laboratory research work with the word swept him up and he went to France as M.O. of a territorial battalion. He got wounded of course and after a spell in the hospital went up to Mesopotamia where he stayed till Christmas of 1918 sweating hard at his job but managing to tumble into a lot of very adventures. For he was at Boku with Dunsterville and he got as far as Taschkin. Where the Bolshell of it shot him up for a fortnight in a bathhouse. During the war he had every kind of sickness where he missed no experience but nothing seemed to damage permanently his whipped cord physique. He told me that his heart and lungs and blood pressure were as good as a lads of 21. Though by this time he was on the wrong side of 40 but when the war was over he hankered for a quiet life. So he bought a practice in the deepest and greatest corner of England. He said his motive was the same as which in the rackety male ages made men retire into monasteries. He wanted quiet and leisure to consider his soul why it he may have found but uncommon little leisure. For I never heard of a country doctor that twilled at his job as he did. He would pay three visits a day to a panel patient which showed the kind of hole he was and he would be out in the small hours the birth of a gypsy child under hedge. He was a first class man in his profession and kept abreast of it but doctrine was only one of a thousand interests. I never met a chap with such an insane shoulder curiosity about everything in heaven and earth. He lived in two rooms in a farmhouse some four miles from us. And I dare say he had several thousand books about him. All day and often half the night he was scour the country in his little one about car and yet when he would drop into see me and have a drink after maybe twenty visits he was as full of beans as if he had got just out of bed. Nothing came a miss to him in talk birds beasts flowers books politics religion everything in the world except himself. He was the best sort of company for behind all his quickness and cleverness he felt that he was a solid bargold but for him I should have taken root in the soil and put out shoots where I have a fine natural talent for vegetating. Mary strongly approved of him in Peter John adored him. He was in tremendous spirit at evening for once in a way gave us reminisce of his past. He told us about the people he badly wanted to see again and Irish spanniered up north of the Argentine who had for cattle men a most murderous band of natives on the mountains who he used to keep in good humor by arranging fights every Sunday. He himself taken on the survivor with his fists and always knocking him out. A scots trader from him calmed who had turned Buddhist priest and in toned his prayers with a strong glass gown accent. Most of all on the lay pirate who he said was sort of Saint Francis with beasts no perfect neuro with his film and that took him to Central Asia and he observed that if he ever left England again he would make for those parts since they were the refuge of all the superior masculinity of creation. He had a notion that something very odd might happen there in the long run. Think of it he cried all the places with names like spells, Wakhara, Samarcan, run by city little gangs of communist Jews. It won't go on forever. Sunday a new Guinness Kong or two more will be thrown up out of the milestone. European's confused enough but Asia is ancient chaos. After dinner we sat around the fire in the library which I had modeled on Sir Walter Bullet Prince room in his place on the canot as I had promised myself seven years ago. I had meant it for my own room where I could write and read and smoke but Mary would not allow it. She had a jullipanel city room of her own upstairs which she rarely entered. But the lie chased her away she was like a hand in a garden, no ice came back so that presently she stopped out of a claim on the other side of my writing table. I have the old hunters notion of order but it was useless to strive with Mary. So now my desk was littered with her letters in the alwork and Peter John's toys and picture books were stacked in the cabinet where I kept my flybooks and Peter John himself used to make a crawl every morning inside and up turned a stool on a earth rock. It was a cold night and very pleasant by the fire outside where some scented logs from an old pear tree were burning. The doctor picked up a detective novel I had been reading in Glenn's step at title page. I can read most things he said but it beats me how you waste time over such stuff. These shockers are too easy, Dick. You can invent better ones yourself. Not I, I call that a dashed ingenious yarn. I can't think how the fellow does it. Quite simple. The writer writes up the story inductively and the reader follows it deductively. Do you see what I mean? Not a bit. I replied, look here. I want to write a shocker so I begin by fixing one or two facts which have no sort of obvious connection. For example, well imagine anything you like. Let us take three things in a long way apart. You pause for a second to consider. You say an old blind woman spinning in the western Highlands, a barn with a new region, satire, and a little curiosity shop in North London kept by a Jew with a divebeard. Not much connection between the three. You invent a connection. Simple enough if you have any imagination, you leave all three into the yarn. The reader, who knows nothing about the three at the start, is puzzled and intrigued. And if the story is well arranged, finally satisfied. He is pleased with the ingenuity of the solution for he doesn't realize that the author fixed upon the solution first and then invented a problem to suit it. I see, I said, you've got to take in the guilt of my favorite light reading. I won't be able anymore to marvel at the writer's cleverness. I'm got another ejection to the stuff. It's not ingenuous enough. Or rather, it doesn't take account of the infernal complexity of life. It might have been all right 20 years ago when most people argued and behaved fairly logically, but they don't nowadays. Have you realized, Dick, the amount of stark craziness that the war has left us in the world? Mary, who is sitting, sewing under a lamp, raised her head and left? Green's laid's face had become serious. I can speak about it frankly here for you too, are almost seen only completely seeing people I know. Well, as a pathologist, I'm fairly staggered. I hardly met a soul who hasn't got some slight kink in his brain as a consequence of the last seven years. With most people, it's a rather pleasant kink. There was settled in their grooves, and they see the comic side of things quicker and are ready for adventure. But with some, it's Puka Madness. And that means crime. Now, are you going to write detective stories about that kind of world on old lines? You can take nothing for granted as you once could, and your Arguside, lightened brain. Expert has nothing solid with which to build his foundations. I observed that the poor old war seemed to be getting blamed for a good deal that I was taught in my childhood. Was due to original sin. Oh, I met questioning your Calvinism. Rachel's in is always there, but in the meaning of civilization, was that we had got it better down under hatches. Whereas now, it's getting its head up. But it isn't only sin. It's a dislocation of the mechanics of human reasoning, a general loosening of screws. Oddly enough, in spite of Pirit talk about shell shock, the men who fought, suffer less from it, than on the whole than other people. The classes that shrink the war are the worst. You see, it in Ireland. Every doctor nowadays has got to be a bit of a mental pathologist. As I say, you can hardly take anything for granted, and if you want detective stories that are not childish, fantasy, you'll have to invent a new kind. Better try your handic. Not I, I am a lover of silver facts. What hang it man, the facts are no longer silver. I could tell you. He paused, and I was expecting a yarn, but he changed his mind. Take all this chatter about psychoanalysis. There's nothing very new in the doctrine, but people are beginning to work it out into details and making considerable asses of themselves in the process. It's an awful thing when a scientific truth becomes a quarry of the half-baked. But as I say, the fact of the subconscious self is a certain as the existence of lungs and arteries. I don't believe that Dick has a subconscious self, said Mary. Oh yes he has, only people who have led this kind of life. How their ordinary self so well-managed and disciplined, there were so much about them as the phrase goes, the subconscious rarely gets a show. But I bet if Dick took to thinking about his soul, which he never does, he would find some queer corners. Take my own case. He turned towards me so that I full-view of his candid eyes and hungry cheekbones, which looked prodigious in the firelight. I belong more or less to the same totem as you, but I've long been aware that I possessed a more curious kind of subconsciousness. I have a good memory in fair powers of observation, but there's nothing to those of my subconscious self take my daily incident. I see in here about a 20th part of the details or a member about a hundredth part. That is assuming that there is nothing special to stimulate my interest. But my subconscious self sees and hears practically everything, and remembers most of it. Only I can't use the memory, but I don't know if I've got it. And can't call it into being when I wish. But every now and then, something happens to turn on the tap of the subconscious. In a ventricle comes through. I find myself sometimes remembering names. I was never aware of having heard. In little incidents and details that I had never consciously noticed, imagination you will say, but it isn't. For everything that the inner memory provided, is exactly true. I've tested it. I could only find some way of tapping it at will. I should be an uncommonly efficient fellow. Incidentally, I should become the first scientist of the age for the trouble with investigation and experiment is that the ordinary brain does not observe sufficiently keenly or remember the data sufficiently accurately. That is interesting, I said. I am not at all certain. I have noticed the same thing in myself, but what has that to do with the madness that you say is in fact in the world. Simply this, the barriers between the conscious and the subconscious have always been pretty stiff in the average man. But now the general loosening up of screws, they are growing, shaking, and the two worlds are getting mixed. It is like two separate tanks of fluid, where the containing walls have worn into holes and one is circulating into the other. The result is confusion and if the fluids are of certain character explosions, that is why that you can't any longer take the clear psychology of most civilized human beings for granted. Something is welling up from the premavile depths to muddy it. I don't object to that. I said, we are overdone, civilization, and personally, I am all for a little barbarism. And I want a simpler world. Then you won't get it, said Glenslight. He had become very serious now and was looking towards Mary as he talked. The civilized is far simpler than the premavile. All history has been in effort to make definitions clear rules of thought, clear rules of content, solid sanctions, by which we can conduct our life. These are the work of the subconscious self. The subconscious isn't elementary in lawless thing if it intrudes on life to results may follow. There will be a weakening of the power of reasoning after all, the only thing that brings man near a sea Almighty, and there will be a failure of nerve. I got up to get a light for us beginning to feel depressed by the doctor's diagnosis of our times. I don't know whether he was all together serious, for he presently started on fishing, which was one of his many hobbies. There was a fair drive-life fishing to be had in a little river. But I had taken a dear forest with Archie Roylands for the season, and Green Slade was coming up with me to try his hand at salmon. There had been no sea trout the year before in the West Highlands, and we fell to discuss in the cause. He was ready with a dozen theories, and we forgot about the psychology of mankind in investigating the uncanny psychology fish. After that Mary singed us. Frank considered any even a failure without that end at half past ten the doctor got into his old usher and departed. As I smoked my last bite, I found my thoughts going over Green Slade's talk. I had found a snow carber, but how he's to be the water seemed to be outside the bar, and how erratic the tides. I wondered if it wasn't shrinking to be so comfortable in a comfortless world. Then I reflected that I was owed a little piece for a hair of roughish life, but Mary's words kept coming back to me about walking delicately. I considered that my present conduct failed that bill. I was mildly thankful for my mercies, and in no way inclined to tempt province by complacency. Going up to bed I noticed my neglected letters on the whole table. I turned them over and saw that they were mostly bills and receipts or tradesmen's circulars, but there was one addressed in handwriting that I knew, and I looked at it, I experienced a sudden sinking of the heart. It was from Lord Artin's well, Sir Walter Bolivant, as was who had now retired from the foreign office. It was living at his place on Kenneth. He and I occasionally corresponded about farming and fishing, but I had premonition. This was something different, and I waited for a second or two before I opened it. My dear deck, this note is in the nature of a warning. In the next day or two, you will be asked, may press to undertake a troublesome piece of business. I am not responsible for the request, but I know of it. If you consent, it will mean the end for a time of your happy vegetable life. I don't want to influence you one way or another. I only give you notice of what is coming, in order that you may address your mind and not be taken by surprise. My love to marry the sun, yours. Hey, that was all. I had lost my trepidition and felt very angry. Why couldn't the fools let me alone? As I went upstairs, I vowed that not all the cajori of the world would make me budge an inch from the path I have set myself. I had done enough for the public service and other people's interest, and it was jolly well-time that I should be allowed to attend my own.

A Christmas Miscellany 2020,Various,82140,,"July 24, 2020",[],0,"isit libravox.org recording by David Wales. A Christmas Masalani 2020 by various part 1, Christmas Eve, Paul Chester Winterpiece, and the old ladies 1924. By Hugh Wolkall, it was a seasonable Christmas that year, enough snow fell, then enough frost came, and then the sun shone. If it did not shine, at least it rode a circle of crimson fire through the heavens, and before the frost, but after this line of preparatory fogs, fragments of its fires splashed the high street, and spread and pools across the precincts floor. As I have intimated another chronicles, Paul Chester of the old days was an enclosed town. The Riviera was unknown to it, and the garden of Allah, a dream with Omaar. Though London might call to the Richard citizens on one occasion or another, at Christmas time, every one stayed at home, and more wonderful yet to our modern disillusion, enjoyed family parties with Christmas trees, plumpooting stockings, and the weights invited into the hall. It is not however that the weather was any more romantic than that it is today. There were just as many rainy and mucky and foggy and dirty and dismal skies, and glebesher warmer than any other part of the British Isles, has never had an intimate acquaintance with crisp and shining snow. About once in 20 years, there are snowfalls, frosts, and blue skies, and how happy then everyone is, and how eagerly everyone hands down the year to an invious posterity. This was such a year, and ten days before Christmas, the frost came and held, the powdered snow remained jooled and resplendent, the sun looked down from a sky as delicately blue as an egg shell, and laughed to see the fun. And fun, there was. Magnets toy shop in the market coasters had a father Christmas, a true and veritable father Christmas, to be seen with two crimson cheeks and long snow white beard, any afternoon between two and four. Jeremy Cole so beheld him, and his sisters Mary and Helen, and the deans son Ernest and the Fisher girls and little Tommy Chowner. He did not say much, but he moved between the dolls and the trains, the balls, and the soldiers, as only Santa Claus could move with an authority, a benignity, a ripe wisdom, that no imposter could have been clever enough to fame. Everyone did their best. In the market place there was a punch and duty with a thick set, jolly face man in charge, and he might have been that very same garric friend of a meridic whose history has been elsewhere narrated. I don't say he was, and I don't say he wasn't. Half way up the high street, grummages, the stationers, had a whole Christmas tree in their window. Here was a stumbling block to the whole high street traffic. It was quite impossible to get any child, any perambulator baby, indeed, passed that window. It was a tree frosted, colored and shining, hung about with every glittering bubble shaped to a perfect pinnacle of exquisite symmetry. But best of all was the window of hunt and Griffith, the general store. For here for the first time in Paul Chester history was a whole front window given over to pageantry, to none other than the scene in the life of Cinderella when, at this pond, to beside the fire, she is amazed by the sudden apparition of her pink hated glad mother. There is the fire and there Cinderella, there the pots and pans, the brick floor, and the huge kitchen rafters, there the godmother, and there beyond the snowline window pain, the vision of the gold coat and the snow white ponies. So great was the confusion outside the window that had this occurred in these traffic haunted times. The show must have been forbidden, but in those lucky days nobody minded, nobody cared. Let the children have a good time. Christmas comes but once a year and even Miss Asamson, although her nirajo was at its height, could not but admit that the window made a happy display. The town rang during those days with laughter, brought to Hill outside the town had just enough snow on it to allow of debugging, and Paul feels having been flooded, gave for a whole wonderful fortnight the most marvelous skating. The town rang with laughter and the ringing of bells, the cathedral let itself go and burst into perpetual peels of marimot to the great annoyance of late sleepers, despeptics, and ruminating essays. There was fun everywhere, apples and oranges in the marketplace, and carols up and down the streets after dark. It was the best Christmas that Paul Chester had known for many a day past, or would know for many a day to come. Mrs. Amarust was one who had always enjoyed a seasonal Christmas to her as to every old person Christmas was filled with sad memories, but she had a wonderful gift of enjoying fun at the moment of its occurrence, and the being aware that she was so enjoying it, and because the fun in her life had been neither frequent nor extravagant, very small occurrences, amused and excited her. This was the happiest Christmas known to her for many a day. Stuggle as she might not to think of the money coming to her, she could not keep it out of her consciousness. She told herself again and again, and when she was alone in her room, she repeated the words aloud sometimes, that she must not place too strong a reliance on her cousin's promise. He may have altered his mind the next moment, it's silly to believe him. Nevertheless, the solemnity of his words, the caress of his hand, as it rested on her head, these things were difficult to dismiss, and the happiness that came from the promise was also difficult to dismiss. She was naturally happy, give her the least excuse, and she must be happy, although she believed that God did not intend that human beings should be very happy, because they were in this world for the training of their souls, and souls were better trained by sorrow than by joy. Nevertheless, an imp of happiness would continue to jump in her heart, and stir her little world with his discord and cries of joy. Joy at what? A kindly action, a splash of sun across the street, a barrel organ round the corner, a stained glass window, an apple and a piece of cheese. She could not keep down or spirits as being a penellus lonely old widow of over 70, she should. And this Christmas, she lost completely herself control. She adored about everything else in the world, the spending of money, perhaps for the very reason that she never had very much to spend. She had never been able to believe that statement often written in the papers that millionaires did not know what to do with their money. Did not know why she could spend a million pounds quite easily at Gammaj's alone. But there, the newspapers were never to be trusted. She liked greatly to be given things, but still better was it herself to make presence. The excitement of giving someone something he or she wanted was intense to watch the opening of the parcel to see the stare of pleasure and surprise to hear the exclamation to feel the affection flowing out. Was there any luxury in life like it? And it was a luxury that of late she had been compelled to deny herself. Last Christmas, she had given Agatha Payne half a dozen pocket handkerchief Mrs. Bloxham, a piece of ribbon, and her cousin, a pocketbook. Worst sorrow of all, it was impossible to send brand anything. No use to throw parcels out into the void. The best she could do was to write two letters. One, a month in advance, and this, she sent to the only address she had, something in California, and then one on Christmas Eve, such as she had always written to him at Christmas time. This, she also sent out to California, but she wrote it because, for a moment, it brought him closer to her. She felt, with his photograph up there in front of her, as though she had him with her in the room. These were all, but poor substitutes for reality, and cheat ourselves as we may, our subconscious selves refused to be deceived. Mrs. Amarist knew nothing about her subconscious self, but she did know that after last Christmas she had a miserable sense of inadequacy and frustrated purpose. She had made nobody happy. Even Mrs. Bloxham had disappeared into the intimacy of her family, to emerge two days later with a black eye and a bruised cheek. This year she would deflate her cap over the mill. She had prospects. She did not face them finally, those prospects, did not take them, hold them in front of her, look them in the eyes, and say to them, as one always ought to do to prospects. Now, are you sound and healthy? Have you got heart and lungs and legs and arms and a good stiff back? No, she merely reported on them. She heard that they were good and healthy, and promised very well indeed. Then she went ahead. The plan came to her in the middle of the night, or rather in one of those early morning hours, when the first cock crows in the hidden despair raises its abominable head. Lying there in the early morning, she drove her to despair as a way and considered a misbarrencher. Poor misbarrencher, what a frightened nervous trembling creature she was. She would like to do something for her. She would like well to give her a happy Christmas and agathopane, too. It was then that the idea came to her. At first, she was frightened of it. It would demand energy and persistence, and had she money enough? Money in the future would not do. She examined her purse and found that she had sufficient that she used part of next quarter's rent. She trembled at that, but she was sure the kind Mr. Agno, when he knew of the promise that her cousin had made to her, would not hesitate to advance her. She trembled, her heart warned her, her cheeks were flushed, and she had a guilty air. But she held to her purpose, and once she had begun, she did not look back. Once she had begun, she could not look back. She moved during those frosty, color days, about the town, the very spirit of adventure. She found that she must go quietly. The excitement tired her, and sometimes she would, in a moment, feel so weary that she could not get to the top of the high street. And on one occasion, when she was at the top, she could not go down again and had to take refuge in the shop of Mr. Bennett, the grand bookseller. There she sat greatly alarmed on a chair in the very middle of the shop, with the busts of Byron and Walter Scott looking down on her, and a grand smell of Russian leather and old vellum in her nostrils, and the complete works of George Elliott at her elbow. Old Mr. Bennett was very kind to her, although she told him at once that she was not there to buy anything, and who should come in at that very moment, but Archdeacon Brandon himself, magnificent handsome superb ordering a somebody on the songs with the air of a king and a conqueror. She looked around her with a hope of seeing some of her husband's plays, and when she did not, would have liked to ask Mr. Bennett whether he kept them in stock, but her courage failed her, and she could only thank him very much, and slip out of the shop as quietly as possible. Fortunately, she did not hear the Archdeacon's question, and who was that shabby little woman. He asked out of all kindness, feeling at his duty as the father of the flock, to keep his eye upon all the inhabitants of the town. She tried to keep her head about her purchases, she found as many another as found before and after, that the best things were always the most expensive, and then when it came to the central purchase of all, to the core, the heart, the kernel, the pinnacle, the pièce de rézdors, de rezone de tra, and any other foreign phrase that you prefer, she found that here expense was inevitable. Try as you would, it must cost more than you had supposed. Of course, she only wanted a small one, but even the small ones, and then, at the last two days before Christmas, she found in the marketplace, in a corner behind the old woman under the green umbrella, the very thing, a darling, a perfect specimen, a miracle, and when she inquired of the nice round-faced man whose possession it was, she found that it was only, well, less than the experience of the last two days had led her to believe possible, although more, a good deal more, than she had originally intended. She bought it, and ordered that it should be sent to her room, blushing a little in spite of herself as she named the address. She gave her name very carefully, begging him to be watchful that it should not be sent to any other room by mistake, and he promised her, saying that he would himself bring it. He did, in fact, arrive with it when she was there, and she liked him very much, holding him in conversation for quite a while, and then giving him an orange for the baby. After that, she guarded her room like a dragon-ass, and would not allow me, barrencher, who was already forming a two constant habit of dropping in, to cross her threshold. Christmas Eve arrived, and Mrs. Amherst, a waking to the inspiring voice of Mrs. Blochism, was delighted when she discovered how fine and clear it was. No wind, the smoke rising from the chimneys elephant gray against the blue, the thin-rind of frost, the sparrows already chattering at her window for their crumbs. After her little midday meal, she sat down to the table, found her paper and envelopes, and wrote to brand. Her letter was as follows. My dearest, darling boy, I must write to you as I always do, although I sadly fear that it will be a long time before you get this letter. The one that I wrote to you a month ago may reach you before Christmas, and I hope it will. This I am writing, because it seems as though I am talking to you, and I don't wish to allow Christmas to pass by, without having a word with my dear boy. Perhaps you have been writing to me, and still to the old address. I told them at tell them a two-fold word anything on, but they are so stupid at the post office, although as a matter of fact, I always think a wonderful considering the sort of postman one sees walking about, that they don't lose more letters than they do. Quite boys, some of them are, and they none of them have very intelligent faces, although I dare say they are good men. Well, dearest boy, I try to imagine to myself the kind of Christmas you are having, but it is really difficult for me, because you told me in the last letter I had from you, that it was quite hot at Christmas time. That seems to me very strange, and not very nice, I think. Of course, it is often warm here for Christmas, both last year and the year before that. We had rain and muggy weather, but this year it is delightful with a hard frost and the sun shining cold and seasonable. It's so pleasant for the children, and more healthy for everybody. I am sure. I am very well in health, that call if I had when I wrote to you last, as quite gone away, and I am sure it's those laws and just that I found at Gubits. He's our best chemist here in the high street. If only I could hear that you are quite well, and will come home soon for a visit, I would be quite happy. You know, dear boy, I am an old woman now, and can't expect to live forever, so that I do hope you'll be able to come home soon. It's very nice here, and I'm very comfortable. There's something else I'd like to tell you about, but I suppose that I must not just yet, because it isn't quite settled. I think of you so much and pray for you night and morning. At this time of the year, when God came down to earth and took upon him, our flesh and was a little baby in a manger, I think we should all make him feel how thankful we are. I know that he is looking after you, and so I don't worry about you, at least I know that you were warm. You used to be so careless about your underclothing when you were a little boy. My dearest boy, you are always in my thoughts, you're loving mother. She sat for a long time after she had written the letter with his photograph in front of her. She thought of him in all the ways that she had known him as a baby at her breast as a small boy and as first trousers, as a boy going to his first day school, and forgetting her so quickly in the new excitement of other boys and games and masters, as all right and proper boys must do, of course. And then, as he grew, her interest in the strange new personality that developed as flower from the bud, a personality that was so strange, because it was like neither herself nor his father, somebody quite knew. And then his growing independence, his chafing at the literary and artistic interest of his father, his desire for the open air life and complete independence. Then her own strange sympathy with him, and although she loved him so dearly, she understood that he should want to get away and be free. She had felt that herself in her married life, and she realized that he was her own dear son, not by right of the quiet and domestic character that was most obvious in her, but by right of that secret independence and sharpness of judgment that her married life had subdued in her. He left her and at intervals returned to her. She had been a woman of 40 when she had born him, and he had been only 27 when she had last seen him, still a boy, although so strong and independent. She looked at the photograph until she seemed to draw him out of the frame, and he came to her and put his arms around her and teased her in the old laughing way that he had always had. But she was not simply a sentimental woman. She was in fact, scornful of emotion that led to nothing, and so she put the photograph back upon the mantelpiece, put on her bonnet and her coat, and because it was already three o'clock, and was soon be dust, her way to have to take her present to her cousin. She summoned all her clock standing for a moment on the bridge, and watching the river take on its evening color softly purple under the dark shadow of the rising hills. Then thinking of the evening that was coming and the fun that it would be, she smiled, things always turned out better than you expected. The stars that were now breaking into the sky above her head were the eyes of God. She was watched over and cared for and protected. She had no need to fear. The town, as she passed up through the high street, was bubbling with marimond and gayety. The shops blazed with lights, the street was crowded, everyone was laughing and happy, hurrying along, loaded with parcels, stopping to speak. It seemed to anyone who was near that they might wish them good luck. This was the world that Mrs. Amorous loved. Why might it not always be like this? She stopped at the Cinderella window, how pretty and touching. She turned around to a stout man beside her and said, isn't it pretty? Indeed, it is mom, he answered her smiling. My little girl wants to take it home. Don't japanze and a diminutive child, squeaked out. Yes! What a pretty little girl, Mrs. Amorous. Thank you mom, answer the fat man. Merry Christmas, I'm sure. And the same to you, Mrs. Amorous. The rest of the way home seemed easy. Arrived in her room, she said about the development of her plan. She had asked Agatha Payne and Maybaranjur to come and visit her at 8 o'clock. She had two hours for her preparations. The time flashed by and in a moment it was a quarter to eight. She hurriedly put on her silk dress, hung around her neck, her thin gold chain, with the locket that held brand sport-trip, brushed her lovely white hair, put on her lace cap, fresh and graced from the laundry, then her stiff, white cuffs finished, completed. She sat down to survey her work. A smile played about her lips. It was the most beautiful thing that she had ever seen in her life. At five minutes past eight there was a knock on her door and then another knock. Agatha Payne and Maybaranjur entered. They stood bewildered on the threshold. It was indeed a pretty sight. The curtains were drawn and the far end of the room was duskly shadowed, but at the fire place and stood the tree. And what a tree. Of just the right size for the room, it had a shape and symmetry that surely no other tree and all Christmas dumb could equal. It tapered gradually with exquisite shape and form to appoint that quivered and flickered like a green flame. On the flame sturdily triumphed father Christmas diminutive and body, but alive in his smile, his stolidity, his gallant color. It was the color that entrants the eye. Mrs. Amarist had worked with the soul of an artist. She had not overburdened the slender branches. The thin chains of frosted silver that hung from bow to bow seemed of themselves to dance in patterned rhythm. Balls of fire, emerald and ruby, amethyst and crystal, shown in the light of the candles, and at every place color blended with color. The tree was always the tree. The light that flashed from its bow was not foreign to it, but seemed to be intagurly part of its life in history. It had been placed on a long and broad looking glass into which it looked down as though into a lake of crystal water. The candles seemed to be the voices of the tree. It was vocal in its pleasure. It's since a fun at its own splendor. It's grand surprise that after all it had come off so well. In proportion in a blending of color, in grandeur of spirit, it was the finest tree in England that night. On either side of the tree were two tables spread with white cloths. On one table were some parcels beautifully tied with colored ribbons and on the other sandwiches, a plunk cake with white icing, some saffron buns, and a dish of sweets and chocolates. The two ladies stood amazed. So pretty was the room with its soft pink colors. It's light dim, save for the Oreo of golden splendor shed by the tree, so utterly unexpected that a display that words would not come. Only at last may bear in your cry, oh dear, dear me, dear me. Both ladies had dressed in their party best. May in her orange silk that suited her, I fear, not too well, and agatha in her dark purple address of a fashion now forgotten, too small for her, but that nevertheless with her black hair finely brushed, her dark eyes flashing gave her the air of older days. The air that had made Mr. Pain 35 years ago call her his jit-sie-queen. Oh, I do hope you don't both think me too silly, said Mrs. Amarist, coming forward, but I simply had to do something discrismous. We've just done nothing the last two grismuses, and it did seem too bad. Don't you think so? I do hope you don't mind. My said may bear in your coming towards the tree and gazing at it with her mouth open like a school girl. Well, my Mrs. Amarist is lovely. It's the lovelyest thing. Well, why can't speak? I can't indeed. Words won't come. I can't say anything at all. Agatha Pain was moved more deeply still. The color possessed her as color always possessed her, coming towards her like a living, breathing person. Holding out its arms to her, whispering to her, you and I, we are the only ones here who understand, I have been waiting for you, and you alone. Indeed, it seemed to her that the tree belonged to her and was hers absolutely. The two other women vanished from her consciousness. She could see only the pale golden flame of the candles, so steady, so pure, so dignified, the balls of amethyst and ruby and crystal, as they swung and turned and gleamed so slightly and yet always with a secret life and purpose of their own. And the deep green of the tree, richly velvet under the light of the candles, she stood absorbed, entranced, waves of sensuous pleasure running through her body. So silent where they both, that after a minute at past, Mrs. Amarist was alarmed. I'm so glad you like it. She said almost timidly, shant we sit down and look at it, I like to think of all the other trees there are tonight in everybody's homes and the children dancing round them in the presence. She broke off because of longing for brand came to her so urgently that it was all she could do not to call out his name. For a moment it seemed to her foolish unboxing, shame and ridiculous sentiment that the three of them, old forgotten, not wanted by anybody, should indulge in this display. But looking up at the tree, she was comforted. Anything so beautiful had its own purpose. She had made a beautiful thing. She felt the joy of the creator in her endie work. They sat in a row looking at the tree. May Barron Jerwa's all in a moment, valuable. She had so much to tell them of the trees that she had known, the trees that she had had in her own house, the trees that she and Jane Bats had decorated together, the Christmas festivities that they had had in Exeter. You would think to hear that Exeter was the center of all the splendor and gait of the world. Oh, she talked and laughed and was so wildly excited that she nearly cried. Agatha Payne said very little, she only stared and stared at the tree. The next part of the entertainment arrived. Mrs. Amaris picked up the parcels in their lovely white paper and colored ribbon and a blushing little shell pink faintly coloring the ivory of her cheeks said, these are little tiny things that I got. You mustn't laugh at me, please, forgetting them. I think the chief part of a present is that it should be wrapped up in paper, don't you, but I hope you like them. And they did like them. At least may bear in her light hers, she had a case with three pairs of scissors and a book in a purple cover, the light of Asia by Sir Edwin Arnold. Agatha Payne said little about hers, only thank you Lucy and a deep horse-throated murmur. She had a box of colored cottons and a purple blotter. She could not take her eyes away from the tree. Then they cut the cake and ate the sandwiches and Mrs. Amaris to me, tea and listened happily, coesely to may bear in jers' reminiscences. How happy it was with the blazing tree, the dim room, the bells peeling beyond the window the crackling fire. Each old lady forgot the other. They were lost in their own world of remembered and recaptured life. Past joys, past sorrows, past desires, past regrets. The clock ticked on the candles burnt with steady flame. The bells rang out. Gradually, Lucy Amaris closed her eyes. She heard may bear in jers' voice from a vast distance, then her own faintly replying, how curious indeed indeed her head sank upon her breast. May bear and jers also bathed in the warmth of the room, comforted with tea and happiness close her eyes. Her head nodded once and twice and thrice. She pulled herself up, stared sharply at Mrs. Amaris, saw two Mrs. Amaris, then three, her head fell, she also slept. Only Agatha Pain, her dork eyes fixed sat without moving, staring at the tree, and of part one.","Culture & Heritage Fiction, Anthologies",English,03:58:07,David Wales,"['Russian', 'Masalani', 'deans']","['Pain', 'Walter Scott', 'Agno', 'Maybaranjur', 'Gammaj', 'Paul', 'Bennett', 'Edwin Arnold', 'Archdeacon Brandon', 'Omaar', 'Amherst', 'Amaris', 'Blochism', ""Barron Jerwa's"", 'Mary', 'Miss Asamson', 'George Elliott', 'Tommy Chowner', 'Paul Chester', 'Griffith', 'Amorous', 'Lucy Amaris', 'David Wales', 'Richard', 'Oreo', 'Amarist', 'Paul Chester Winterpiece', 'Ernest', 'Jeremy Cole', 'Hugh Wolkall', 'Lucy', 'Amarust', 'Santa Claus', 'Jane Bats', 'Agatha Pain', 'Cinderella', 'Bloxham']","['Helen', 'California', 'England', 'London']","['Asia', 'the British Isles']",0,2,2,0,18,5,1
Ante-Nicene Christian Library: Translations of the Writings of the Fathers Down to A.D. 325,Alexander Roberts,91425,4.0,"April 7, 2020",[],0,"e public domain. For more information or devolent here, please visit Librevox.org. Anteniceine Christian Library, translations of the writings of the fathers down to AD325 by Alexander Roberts Editor. Introduction. Our aim in these translations has been to give a rendering of the original as literal as possible. And to this we have it here even in cases and they are not a few, which the Latin or the Greek is not in strict accordance with grammatical rule. It was thought advisable in all cases to give the reader the means of forming an accurate estimate of the style, as well as the substance of these curious documents. The apocryphal gospels properly so-called consists of 22 separate documents of which ten are written in Greek and 12 in Latin is 22 may be classed under three heads. A those relating to the history of Joseph and the Virgin Mary, previous to the birth of Christ, B those relating to the infancy of the Savior and see those relating to the history of Pile. The origins of the traditions are the proto-evangellium of James, the gospel of Thomas and the Acts of Pile. All or most of the others can be referred to these three as compilations, modifications or amplifications. There is abundant evidence of the existence of many of these traditions in the second century, though it cannot be made out that any of the books were then in existence in their present form. The greater number of the authorities on the subject, however, seemed to agree in assigning to the first four centuries of the Christian era, the following five books. One, the proto-evangellium of James, to the gospel of pseudo-mafiu, three the history of Joseph the Carpentyr, four the gospel of Thomas and five the gospel of Nicodemus. We proceed to give a very brief notice of each of them. The proto-evangellium of James, the name of proto-evangellium was first given to it by Postel, whose Latin version was published in 1552. The James is usually referred to St. James, the less the Lord's brother, but the title is very very much. Origin in the end of the second century mentions a book of James, but it is by no means clear that he refers to the book in question. Justin Martyr and two passages refers to the cave in which Christ was born, and from the end of the fourth century down, there are numerous illusions and ecclesiastical writings to statements made in the proto-evangellium. For his addition, Tishendorf made use of 17 manuscripts, one of them belonging to the 9th century. The Greek is good of the kind in free from errors and corruptions. There are translations of it into English by Jones, 1722 and Cooper, 1867. The Gospel of Sudo Matthew, the majority of the manuscripts attribute this book to Matthew, though the title is very much. The letters prefixed, professing to be written to and by St. Jerome exist in several of the manuscripts, but no one who is acquainted with the style of Jerome's letters will think this one authentic. There are however, and his works many illusions to some of the legends mentioned in this book, chapters 1 through 24 were edited by Thilo. Chapter 25 to the end are edited for the first time by Tishendorf. It is not very clear whether the Latin be original or a direct translation from the Greek. In most part it seems to be original. The list of epithets however applied to the triangles of the Alpha and chapter 31 are pretty obviously mistranslations of Greek technical terms, which it might not be difficult to reproduce. Gospel of the Nativity of Mary. This work which is in substance the same as the earlier part of the proceeding, yet differs from it in several important points, indicating a later date in a different author. It is acquired great celebrity from having been transferred almost entire to the historian Lambertica, or Legenda or Orare in the end of the 13th century. Medieval poetry and sacred art have been much indebted to its pages. The original is in Latin and is not a direct translation from the Greek and many passages that follow is very closely the whole gate translation. The history of Joseph the Carpenter. The original language of the history is captic from the captic it was translated into Arabic. The Arabic was published by Wallen in 1722 with a Latin translation and copious notes. Wallen's version has been republished by Feb. The original version of the Greek is the Greek and later in some of the amended form by Thilo. This amended form of Wallen's version is the text adopted by Titian Dorf. The 23 have been published in the Sahitic test by Zoya in 1810 with a Latin translation and more correctly by Deloria in 1835 with a French translation. The 14th century is the Greek and Dorf employed various arguments in the form of his opinion that the work belongs to the 4th century. It is found he said in both dialects of the captic. The eschatology of it is not inconsistent with an early date. The Feb. At the beginning of the 13th century the death of the virgin Mary and chapter 5 is inconsistent with the doctrine of the assumption which began to prevail in the 5th century. The Gospel of Thomas liked the pro-Huivengellium of James the Gospel of Thomas is of undoubtedly antiquity. It is mentioned by name by origin, quoted by Aranius and the author of the Fulasso Humana, who says that it was used by the Nashashines, a nostic sect of the 2nd century. Cyril of Jerusalem, who passed in 386, attributes the authorship not to be a apostle, but to a Thomas who was one of the three disciples of Manus. This factor course indicates that Cyril knew nothing of the antiquity of the book he was speaking of. This Manakean origin has been adopted by many writers of whom the best known are in recent times, Ars Simon and Mingad Ali. The text of the 1st Greek form is obtained from a blown up manuscript published by Mingad Ali with a Latin translation in 1764. A Dresden manuscript of the 16th century edited by Thylow, a Viennese fragment edited by Lam Bassius and a Parisian fragment first brought to light by Colteleir and his addition of the Apostolic Constitutions and translated into English by Jones. The 2nd Greek form is published for the first time by Tishendorf, who got the manuscript which is on paper of the 14th or 15th century from one of the monasteries on Mount Sinai. The Latin form is also published for the first time from a Vatican manuscript. There is another Latin text existing in a Paul Messec which Tishendorf assigns to the 5th century, and asserts to be much near the ancient Greek copy than any of the other manuscripts. It seems pretty clear from the contents of the book that it's author was a nostic, a doistist, and a markozyan, and it was held in estimation by the Nasha Shines and the Manakeans. It's bearing upon Christian art and to some extent Christian dogma is well known. The Greek of the original is by no means good, and the Latin translator has in many cases mistaken, the meaning of common Greek words. Arabic Gospel of the Savior's Infancy. Chapters 1 through 9 are found on the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, in on the protol Evangelium of James. Chapters 36 to the end are compiled from the Gospel of Thomas. The rest of the book chapters 10 through 35 is thoroughly oriental in its character, reminding one of the tales of the Arabian knights, or in the episodes in the golden S of a Puleus. It is evident that the work is a compilation, and that the compiler was an oriental. Various arguments are used to prove that the original language of it was Syriac. It was first published with a Latin translation and copious notes by Professor Sike of Cambridge in 1697, afterwards by Fabriquius Jones Schmidt and Thylo. Tition Dors text is Sike's Latin version, amended by Flesher. They are not sufficient data for fixing with any accuracy, the time at which it was composed or compiled. The Gospel of Nicodemus. The six documents inserted under this name are various forms of two books, two in Greek, and one in Latin of the Acts of Pile. One in Greek and two in Latin of the descent of Christ to the world below. Of 12 manuscripts only two or three give the second part consecutively with the first, nor does it so appear in the Coptic translation. The title of Gospel of Nicodemus does not appear before the 13th century. Just to martyr mentions a book called The Acts of Pile, and Eusebius informs us that the Emperor Maximum allowed or ordered a book composed by the Pagan's under this title, to be published in a certain portion of the Empire, and even to be taught in the schools, but neither of these could have been the work under consideration. Titionedorf attributes it to the second century, which is probably too early, though without doubt the legend was formed by the end of the second century. Mori places it in the beginning of the fifth century, from 405 to 420, and ran on, concur as in this opinion. Enable writer and the quarterly review, volume 116 assigns it to 439, the author of the article, Pileit in Smith's Bible Dictionary, gives the end of the third century as the probable date. The author was probably a Hellenistic Jew converted to Christianity, or as Titionedorf and Mori conclude, a Christian imbued with Judaic and Nostick beliefs. The original language was most probably Greek, though, as in the case of Sudo Matthew, the history of Joseph the Carpenter, etc. The original language is in many of the prophecies, stated to have been Hebrew. Something that Latin was the original language on the ground that Pileit would make his report to the Emperor and that the official language. The Latin text we have however is obviously a translation. Made more of her by a man to whom Greek was not very familiar, as is obvious from several instances specified in our notes to the text. The additional principles of the Latin text is without place or date, and it has been reedited by Jones, Birch, Fabricius, Thilo and others. The Greek text of Part 1 and of a portion of Part 2 was first published by Birch, and afterwards in a much improved form with the addition of copious notes and prolegomana by Thilo. The latter part of this prolegomana contains a full account of the English, French, Italian, and German translations. For his addition, Titian Dorf consulted 39 ancient documents of which a full account is given in his prolegomana. For an interesting account of these documents, see the introduction to Mr. B. H. Cooper's translation of the Apocryphal Gospels. The letter of Pontius Pileit, the text is formed from four authorities, none of them ancient. The report of Pileit. The first of these documents was first published by Fabricius with a Latin translation. The second by Birch and then by Phyllow. Titian Dorf has made use of five manuscripts, the earliest of the 12th century. It does not seem possible to assign a date. The paradoxus of Pileit. It has been well remarked by the author of the article in the quarterly review above referred to, that the early church looked on Pileit with no unfavorable eye. That he is favorably shown in the catacombs, that the early fathers interpreted him as a figure of the early church, and held him to be guiltless of Christ's death. That the creeds do not condemn him, and the cappedic church has even made him a saint. He remarks also that Dante finds punishments for chiphison andus, but not for Pileit. The text was first edited by Birch and afterwards by Phyllow. Titian Dorf makes use of five manuscripts of which the earliest belongs to the 12th century. The death of Pileit. This is published for the first time by Titian Dorf from a Latin manuscript of the 14th century. The language shows it to be of a late date. It appears almost entire in the agenda or aia. The narratives of Joseph. This history seems to have been popular in the Middle Ages, if we judge from the number of the Greek manuscripts of it which remained. It was first published by Birch and after him by Phyllow. For his addition, Titian Dorf made use of three manuscripts of which the oldest belongs to the 12th century. And finally, the avenging of the Savior, this version of the legend of Veronica's written in very barbarous Latin, probably of the 7th or 8th century. An Anglo-Saxon version, which Titian Dorf concludes to be derived from the Latin, was edited and translated for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society by CW Goodwin in 1851. The Anglo-Saxon text is from a manuscript in the Cambridge Library, one of a number presented to the Cathedral of Exeter by Bishop Leo Frick in the beginning of the 11th century. The reader will observe that there are in this document to distinct legends, somewhat clumsily joined together that of Nathan's embassy and that of Veronica.

Short Ghost and Horror Collection 036,Various,120656,1.0,"March 24, 2020",[],0,"agon by HP Lovecraft. I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain since by tonight I shall be no more. Penelists and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life indurable I can bear the torture no longer and shall cast myself from this Garrett window into the squalid street below. Do not think from my slavery to morphine that I am a weakling or a degenerate. When you have read these hastily-scrawled pages, you may guess though never fully realize why it is that I must have forgetfulness or death. It was in one of the most open and least-frequented parts of the broad Pacific that the packet of which I was super cargo fell a victim to the German sea raider. The Great War was then at its very beginning and the ocean forces of the hunt had not completely sunk to their later degradation. So that our vessel was made a legitimate prize, whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration do us as naval prisoners. So Librevox indeed was the discipline of our captors that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time. And I finally found myself a drift and free I had but little idea of my surroundings. Never a competent navigator I could only guess vaguely by the sun and stars that I was somewhat south of the equator. Of the longitude I knew nothing and no island or coastline was in sight. The weather kept fair and for uncounted days I drifted aimlessly beneath the scorching sun, waiting either for some passing ship or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land. But neither ship nor land appeared and I began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastness of unbroken blue. The change that happened while I slept. Its details I shall never know, for my slumber though troubled and dream infested was continuous. When at last I awaked it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about me and monotonous undulations as far as I could see and in which my boat lay grounded some distance away. No one might well imagine my first sensation would be of wonder at so prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery. I was in reality more horrified than astonished. For there was in the air and in the routing soil a simster quality which chilled me to the very core. The region was putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish and of other less describable things which I saw protruding from the nasty mud of the unending plain. Perhaps I should not hope to convey in mere words the unoperable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence and bear in a mancety. There was nothing within hearing and nothing incite save a vast reach of black slime. Yet the very completeness of the stillness and the homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a nauseating fear. The sun was blazing down from the sky which seemed to me almost black and its cloudless cruelty as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet. As I crawled into the stranded boat I realized that only one theory could explain my position. Through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface exposing regions which for innumerable millions of years had laying hidden under unfathomable watery depths. So great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me that I could not detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean, strain my ears as I might. Moreover there any sea foul to prey upon the dead things. For several hours I sat thinking or brooding in the boat which lay upon its side and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens. As the day progressed the ground lost some of its stickiness and it seemed likely to dry sufficiently for traveling purposes in a short time. That night I slept but little and the next day I made for myself a pack containing food and water, preparatory to an overland journey in search of the vanishing sea and possible rescue. On the third morning I found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease. The odor of the fish was maddening but I was too much concerned with graver things to mine so slight and evil and set out boldly for an unknown goal. All day I forged steadily westward guided by a faraway humic which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert. That night I encamped and on the following day still traveled toward the humic though that objects seemed scarcely nearer than when I had first aspided. Too weary to ascend I slept in the shadow of the hill. I know not why my dreams were so wild that night but air the waning and fantastically give us moon had risen far above the eastern plain I was awake in a cold perspiration determined to sleep no more. Such visions as I had experienced were too much for me to endure again and in the glow of the moon I saw how unwise I had been to travel by day. Without the glare of the parking sun my journey would have cost me less energy indeed I now felt quite able to perform the ascent which had deterred me at sunset. Picking up my pack I started for the crest of the eminence. I have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plane was a source of vague horror to me but I think my horror was greater when I gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable pit or canyon whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high enough to elumen. I felt myself on the edge of the world peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night. Through my terror ran curious reminiscences of paradise lost and of Satan's hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darkness. As the moon climbed higher in the sky I began to see that the slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as I had imagined. Pages and outcroppings of rock afforded fairly easy footholds for a descent whilst after a drop of a few hundred feet the declivity became very gradual. Urged on by an impulse which I cannot definitely analyze I scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath gazing into the stigean depths where no light had yet penetrated. All at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the opposite slope which rose steeply about a hundred yards ahead of me and object that gleamed lightly in the newly bestowed rays of the ascending moon. That it was merely a gigantic piece of stone I soon assured myself but I was conscious of a distant impression that its contours and position were not altogether the work of nature. A closer scrutiny filled me with sensations I cannot express. For despite its enormous magnitude and its position in an abyss which had yawned at the bottom of the sea since the world was young, I perceived beyond a doubt that the strange object was a well-shaped monolith whose massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the warship of living and thinking creatures. Days and frightened yet without a certain thrill of the scientists or archaeologists delight, I examine my surroundings more closely. The moon, now near the zenith, shown weirdly and vividly above the towering steepest that hemmed in the chasm and revealed the fact that a far-flung body of water flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions and almost lapping my feet as I stood on the slope. Across the chasm, the wave lets wash the base of the cyclopian monolith. On whose surface I could now trace both inscriptions and crude sculptures. The writing was in a system of higher glyphs unknown to me and unlike anything I had ever seen in books, consisting for the most part of conventionalized aquatic symbols such as fishes, eels, octopi, crustaceans, muscles, whales and the like. Several characters obviously represented marine things which are unknown to the modern world but whose decomposing forms I had observed on the ocean-risen plane. It was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me spellbound. Finally visible across the intervening water on account of their enormous size were an array of bozz reliefs who subjects would have excited the envy of a dore. I think that these things were supposed to depict men, at least a certain sort of men, though the creatures were shown, disporting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well. Other faces and forms I dare not speak in detail and the mere remembrance makes me grow faint. Grotesque beyond the imagination of a poar bullwerd, they were damn nipply human in general outline despite webbed hands and feet, shockingly wide and flabby lips, glassy, bulging eyes and other features less pleasant to recall. Curiously enough, they seem to have been chiseled badly out of proportion with their scenic background for one of the creatures which shown in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger than himself. I remarked as I say, their grotesqueness and strange size but in the moment decided that they were merely imaginary gods of some primitive fish or sea-faring tribe. Some tribe whose last descendant had perished eras before the first ancestor of the pilt down or the Andorthal man was born. All struck at this unexpected glimpse into a pass beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologist, I stood musing while the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel before me. Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mask its rise to the surface, a thing slid into view above the dark waters. Vast, polyphemous lake and loadsum, it darted like a dependous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds, I think I went mad then. Of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat, I remember little. I believe I sang a great deal and laughed oddly when I was unable to sing. I have indistinct recollections of a great storm sometime after I reach the boat. At any rate, I know that I heard peels of thunder and other tones which nature utters only in her wildest moods. When I came out of the shadows I was in a San Francisco hospital, brought thither by the captain of the American ship which had picked up my boat in mid-Ocean. In my delirium I had said much, but found that my words had been given scant attention. Of any land a pevel in the Pacific, my rescuers knew nothing. Nor did I deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which I knew they could not believe. Once I sought out a celebrated ethnologist and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient Philistine legend of Dagan, the fish god. But soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional, I did not press my inquiries. It is at night, especially when the moon is gibbess and waning that I see the thing. I tried morphine but the drug has given only transience of crease and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave. So now I am to end it all, having written a full account for the information or the contentious amusement of my fellow men. What did I ask myself if it could not all have been a pure fan-tasm, a mere freak of fever as I lay sun-stricken and raving in the open boat after my escape from the German men of war? This I ask myself, but ever does there come before me a hideously vivid vision in reply? I cannot think of the deep sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be crawling and floundering on its slimy bed, worshiping their ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of water soaked granite. I dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag down in their wreaking talons the remnants of puny war exhausted mankind. Of a day when the land shall sink and the dark ocean shall ascend amidst universal pandemonium. The end is near. I hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it, it shall not find me, God that hand the window, the window, and of day gone.",Horror & Supernatural Fiction,English,04:59:14,LibriVox Volunteers,"['stigean', 'German', 'American']","['Garrett', 'Librevox', 'Philistine']","['San Francisco', 'Satan', 'mid-Ocean']",['Pacific'],0,0,0,0,2,0,1
Christmas Short Works Collection 2020,Various,72849,2.0,"December 17, 2020",[],0,"Librevox.org. Recording by Annie Mars. Santa Claus lives in the laughing valley where stands the big, rambling castle in which his toys are manufactured. His workmen selected from the riles, nooks, pixies and fairies live with him and everyone is as busy as can be from one year's end to another. It is called the laughing valley because everything there is happy and gay. The brook chuckles to itself as it leaves, frolicking between its grain banks, the wind whistles merrily in the trees. The sun beams dance lightly over the soft grass and the violets and wildfires looks smilingly up from their greenness. To laugh, one needs to be happy. To be happy, one needs to be content and throughout the laughing valley of Santa Claus contentment reign supreme. On one side is the mighty forest of Bursey. At the other side stands the huge mountain that contains the caves of the demon and between them the valley lies smiling and peaceful. One would think that our good old Santa Claus, who devotes his days to making children happy, would have no enemies on all the earth. And as a matter of fact, for a long period of time, he encountered nothing but love wherever he might go. The caves of the demons are five in number, a broad pathway leads up to the first cave, which is a finally arched cavern at the foot of the mountain. The entrance being beautifully carved and decorated, in it resides the demon of selfishness. Back of this is another cavern, inhabited by the demon of envy. The cave of the demon of hatred is next in order, and through this one passes to the home of the demon of malice situated in a dark and fearful cavern in the very heart of the mountain. I do not know what lies beyond this. Some say their terrible pitfalls leading to death and destruction, and this may very well be true. However, from each one of the four caves mentioned, there is a small narrow tunnel leading to the fifth cave. A cozy little room occupied by the demon over pentence, and as the rocky floors of these passages are well-worned by the track of passing feet. I judge that many wanderers in the caves of the demons have escaped through the tunnels to the abode of the demon over pentence, who is said to be a pleasant sort of fellow, who gladly opens for one a little door, admitting you into fresh air and sunshine again. Well, these demons of the caves, thinking they had great cause to dislike old sandacles, held a meeting one day to discuss the matter. I'm really getting lonesome, said the demon of selfishness, but sandacles distribute so many pretty Christmas presents to all the children that they become happy and generous through his example and keep away from my cave. I am having troubled, rejoined the demon of envy, the little ones seem quite content with sandacles, and there are few indeed that I can coax to become envious. And that makes it bad for me to clear the demon of hatred, for if no children passed through the caves of selfishness and envy, none can get to my cabin, or to mine, out of the demon of malice. For my pot, said the demon over pentence, is easily seen that if children do not visit your caves, they have no need to visit mine, so that I am quite as neglected as you are, and all because of this person they call sandacles exclaimed the demon of envy. He is simply ruining our business and something must be done at once. To this they readily agreed, but what to do was another and more difficult matter to settle. They knew that sandacles worked all through the year at its castle in the laughing valley, preparing the gifts he was to distribute on Christmas Eve, and at first they resolved to try to tempt him into their caves, that they might lead him onto the terrible pitfalls that ended in destruction. So the very next day, while Santa Claus was busy at work surrounded by his little band of assistance, the demon of selfishness came to him and said, these toys are wonderfully bright and pretty, why do you not keep them for yourself? Is it pity to give them to those noisy boys and fretful girls who break and destroy them so quickly? Nonsense, cried the old grey beard, his bright eyes twinkling merrily as he turned towards the tempting demon. The boys and girls are never so noisy and fretful after receiving my presence, and if I can make them happy for one day in the year, I am quite content. So the demon went back to the others who awaited him in their caves and said, I have failed for Santa Claus is not at all selfish. The following day, the demon of envy visited Santa Claus said he, the toy shops are full of play things quite as pretty as those you are making. What a shame it is that they should interfere with your business. They make toys by machinery, much quicker than you can make them by hand. And they sell them for money, or you get nothing for all your work. But Santa Claus refused to be envious of the toy shops. I can supply the little ones, but once a year on Christmas Eve he answered, for the children are many, and I am but one. As my work is one of love and kindness, I should be ashamed to receive money for my little gifts. But throughout all the year, the children must be amused in some way, and so the toy shops are able to bring much happiness to my little friends. I like the toy shops, and am glad to see them prosper. In spite of the second rebuff, the demon of hatred thought he would try to influence Santa Claus. So the next day he entered the busy workshop and said, good morning Santa, I have bad news for you. Been run away like a good fellow, answered Santa Claus, bad news or something that should be kept secret and never told. You cannot escape this however, declare the demon, for in the world are good many who do not believe in Santa Claus, and these you are bound to hate bitterly, since they have so wronged you. Love and rubbish, cried Santa, and there are others who resent your making children happy, and who sneer at you and call you a foolish old rattle-pap. You are quite right to hate such based slanderers, and you ought to be revenge upon them for their evil words. But I don't hate them. Exclaim Santa Claus positively. Such people do me no real harm. And merely render themselves and their children unhappy, poor things, I'd much rather help them any day than injure them. Indeed the demons could not tempt old Santa Claus in any way. On the contrary, he was shrewd enough to see that their object in visiting him was to make mischief and trouble, and his cheering laughter disconcered at the evil ones has showed them the folly of such an undertaking. So they abandoned honeyed words and determined to use force. It was well known that no harm could come to Santa Claus while he is in the laughing valley, for the fairies and riles and nooks all protect him. But on Christmas Eve, H.I.S. is reindeer out into the big world carrying a slayload of toys and pretty gifts to the children. This was the time and the occasion when his enemies had the best chance to injure him. So the demons laid their plan and awaited the arrival of Christmas Eve. The moon shone big and white in the sky, and the snow lay crisp and sparkling on the ground as Santa Claus cracked his whip and sped away out of the valley into the great well beyond. The roomy slay was packed full with huge sacks of toys and as the reindeer dashed onward, the jolly old Santa laughed and whistle had sang for very joy. For in all his merry life, this was the one day in the year when he was happiest. The day he lovingly bestowed the treasures of his workshop upon the little children. It would be a busy night for him. He well knew as he whistled and shouted and cracked his whip again. He reviewed and in mind all the towns and cities and farmhouses where he was expected and figured that he had just enough presence to go around and make every child happy. The reindeer knew exactly what was expected of them and dashed along so swiftly that their feet scarcely seemed to touch the snow-covered ground. Suddenly a strange thing happened, a rope shut through the moonlight and a big news that was in the end of it settled over the arms and body of Santa Claus and true tight. Before he could resist or even cry out, he was jirt from the sea to the slay and tumble head foremost into a snow bank while the reindeer rushed onward with their load of toys and carried it quickly. Out of sight and mind. Much of surprising experience confused old Santa for a moment and when he had collected his senses, he found that the wicked demons had pulled him from the snow drift and bound him tightly with many coils of the stout rope and then they carried the kidnap Santa Claus away to their mountain, where they thrust the prisoner into a secret cave and chained him to the rocky wall so that he could not escape. Ha ha, laughed the demons, rubbing their hands together with cruelly what will the children do now, but they will cry and scold and storm when they find their iron or toys in their stalking and their gifts on their Christmas trees and what a lot of punishment they will receive from their parents and how they will flock to our caves of selfishness and envy and hatred and malice. But we have done a mighty clever thing, we the demons of the caves. Now it's so chance that on this Christmas Eve, the good Santa Claus had taken with him in his lay, not her the rile, Peter the Nuck, killed to the pixie, a small fairy named whisk, his four favorite assistants, these little people he had often found very useful and helping him to distribute his gifts to the children and when they are master was so suddenly dragged from this lay they were all snugly tucked underneath the seat, where the sharp wind could not reach them. The tiny and mortals knew nothing of the capture of Santa Claus until sometime after he had disappeared, but finally they missed his sheer voice and as they must have always sang or whistled on his journeys, the silence warned them that something was wrong. Little whisk stuck out his head from underneath the seat and found Santa Claus going, and no one to direct the fly of the reindeer, whoa he called out and the deer obediently slackened speed, it came to a halt. Peter and Nether and Kilther all jumped upon the seat and looked back over the trek, made by the sleigh, that Santa Claus had been left miles and miles behind. What shall we do, asked whisk anxiously, all the Murph and Mishiff vanished from his wee face by this great calamity. We must go back at once and find our master, said Nathara Ryle, her thought and spoke with much deliberation, no no exclaimed Peter the Nuck, who crossing crab though he was, might always be dependent upon in an emergency, if we delay or go back, they will not be tying to get the toys to the children before morning and that would grieve Santa Claus more than anything else. In his third and that some wicked creatures have captured him at a Kilther thoughtfully, and their object must be to make the children unhappy. So our first duty is to get the toys distributed as carefully as a Santa Claus were himself present. afterward, we can search for our master and easily secure his freedom. This seems such good and sensible advice, that the others at once resolved to adopt it. Peter the Nuck called to the reindeer and the faithful animals again sprung forward and dashed over hill and valley through forest and plain, until they came to the houses we were in children, lay sleeping and dreaming of the pretty gifts they would find on Christmas morning. The little immortals had set themselves a difficult task, but although they had assisted Santa Claus on many of his journeys, their master had always directed and guided them, and told them exactly what he wished to do, but now they had to distribute the toys according to their own judgment, and they did not understand children as well as did old Santa, so it was no wonder they made some lifeable areas. Mamie Brown, who wanted a doll, got a drum instead, and as drum is of no use to a girl who loves dolls, and Charlie Smith, who delights a romp and play out of doors, who wanted some new rubber boots to keep his feet dry, received a sewing box, filled with colored warstards and threads and needles, which made him so per vote that he thoughtlessly called our dear Santa Claus a fraud. Had there been many such mistakes, the demons would have accomplished their evil purpose and made the children unhappy, but little friends of the absent Santa Claus lay but faithfully and intelligently to carry out their master's ideas, and they made fewer errors than might be expected under such unusual circumstances, and although they worked as swiftly as possible, they had begun to break before the toys and other presents were all distributed. So for the first time in many years, Miranda had tried it into the laughing valley on their return, and brought daylight. The brilliant sun, peeping over the edge of the forest to prove they were far behind their accustomed hours. Having put the deer in the stable, the little folk began to wonder how they might rescue their master, and they realized they must discover, first of all, what had happened to him and where he was. So whisk the fairy, transported himself to the bower of the fairy queen, and once there, it did not take him long to find out all about the naughty demons and how they had kidnapped the good Santa Claus to prevent his making children happy, the fairy queen, also promised her assistant, and then fortified by this power and support, whisked flew back to another and Peter and killed her, awaited him, and the four council together, and laid plans to rescue their master from his enemies. It is possible that Santa Claus was not as merry as usual during the night that succeeded his capture. Moreover, he had faith in the judgment of his little friends, he could not avoid a certain amount of worry, and an anxious look would creep at time into his kind old eyes as he thought of the disappointment that might await his dear little children, and the demons who guided him by turn, one after another did not neglect to torn him with contemptuous words in his helpless condition. When Christmas day dawned, the demon of Malice was guarding the prisoner, and his tongue was sharper than that of any of the others. The children are waking up, Santa, he cried, they are waking up, they find their stockings empty, ho-ho-ho, how they quarrel, and whale, and step-thifed feet in anger. Our caves will be full today, Santa, our caves are sure to be full. What to this, as the other, like taunts, Santa Claus and Sett nothing, he was much grieved by his capture, it is true, but his courage did not forsake him, and finding that the prisoner would not reply to his jeers, the demon of Malice, presently went away, and sent the demon over Pentons to take his place. This last personage was not so disagreeable as the others, he had gentle and refined features, and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone. My brother, demons, do not trust me over much, said he, as he entered the cavern, but it is morning now, and the mischief is done, you cannot visit the children again for another year. That is true, and said Santa Claus, almost cheerfully. Christmas Eve is passed, and for the first time in the centuries, I have not visited my children. The little ones will be greatly disappointed, murmured, at the demon over Pentonth, almost regretfully. But that cannot be helped now. Their grief is likely to make the children selfish and envious and hateful. Have they come to the caves of the demons today? I shall get a chance to lead some of them to my cave of repentance. Do you never repent yourself? I'll Santa Claus, curiously? Oh, yes indeed, and to the demon. Time even now, repenting that I assisted in your capture. Of course, it is too late to remedy the evil that has been done, but repentance, you know, can come only after an evil thought or deed, for in the beginning there is nothing to repent of. So I understand, Santa Claus, those who avoid evil need never visit your cave. As a rule that is true, replied the demon, hit you, who have done no evil, or about to visit my cave at once, for to prove that I sincerely regret my share in your capture. I am going to permit you to escape. This speech greatly surprised the prisoner, until he reflected that it was just what might be expected of the demon over Pentonth. The fellow at once, busyed himself, untie the notes that bound Santa Claus and unlocking the chains that fastened him to the wall, then he led the way through a long tunnel, until they both emerged in the cave of repentance. I hope you will forgive me, so the demon pleadingly, I am not really a bad person, you know, and I believe I accomplish a great deal of good in the world. With this he opened the back door that led in a flood of sunshine, Claus sniffed the fresh air greatly. I bear no malice, said he to the demon in a gentle voice, and I am sure the world would be a dreary place without you. So good morning and a merry Christmas to you. With these words, he stepped out to greet the bright morning, and a moment later he was trudging along, whistling softly to himself on his way to his home in the laughing valley. Muching over the snow toward the mountain was a vast army made up of the most curious creatures imaginable. There were no less nooks from the forest, as rough and crooked in appearance as the Nile branches of the trees they had been administered to. And there were dainty rails from the fields, each one bearing the emblem of the flower or plant it guarded, behind these were many ranks of pixies, gnomes, and nymphs. In the rear, a thousand beautiful fairies, floating along in gorgeous array. This wonderful army was led by whisk, Peter, Natter, and Kiltre, who had assembled it to rescue Santa from captivity, and to punish the demons who had dared to take him away from his beloved children. And although they looked so bright and peaceful, the little immortals were armed with powers that would be very terrible to those who had incurred their anger. Woe to the demons of the caves is this mighty army of vengeance ever met them. But low, coming to meet his loyal friends, appeared the imposing form of Santa Claus, his white beard floating in the breeze, and his bright eyes sparkling pleasure at the proof of the love and veneration he had inspired in the hot, for the most powerful creatures in existence. And while they clustered around him and danced with Gly at his safe return, he gave them earnest thanks for their support, but whisk and Natter, and Peter, and Kiltre, him, braced affectionately. It is useless to pursue the demons, said Santa Claus to the army. They have their place in the world, and can never be destroyed. But that is a great pity nevertheless he continued musingly. To the fairies and nooks and pixies and riles, all the squirt of the good man to his castle, and they left him to talk over the events of the night with his little assistants. Whisk had already rendered himself invisible and flown through the big world to see how the children were getting along on this bright Christmas morning, and by the time he returned, Peter had finished telling Santa Claus of how they had distributed the toys. He really did very well, quite the fairie, and a police voice, but I found little unhappiness among the children this morning. Still, you must not get captured again my dear master, but we might not be so fortunate another time in carrying out your ideas. Hey then related the mistakes that had been made, and which he had not discovered until his tour of inspection. And Santa Claus at once sent him with rubber boots for Charlie Smith, and a doll for a manly brown, so that even those two disappointed ones became happy. As for the wicked demons or the caves, they were filled with anger and chagrin, when they found that their clever capture of Santa Claus had come to naught. Indeed, no one on that Christmas day appeared to be at all selfish or envious or hateful and realizing that while the children's saint had so many powerful friends, it was fully to oppose him. The demons never again attempted to interfere his journeys on Christmas Eve.

Olga Romanoff,George Griffith,205944,3.0,"April 6, 2020",[],0,"g. Olga Romanoff by George Griffith. Prologue. The prophecy of Natas. These are the last words of Israel, Demosker, known in the days of Strive as Natas, the master of terror. Given to the children of deliverance dwelling in the land of Area in the 25th year of the peace, which in the reckoning of the West is the year 1900 and 30. My life is lived and the wings of the angel of death overshadow me as I write. But before the last summons comes, I must obey the spirit within me. The bits me tell of the things that I have seen. In order that the story of them shall not die, nor be disguised by false reports as the years multiply. And the myths gather over the graves of those who, with me, have seen and wrought them. For this reason, the words that I write shall be read publicly in the years of you and your children and your children and till they shall see a sign in heaven to tell them that the end is at hand. No man among you shall take away from that which I have written, nor yet add anything to it. And every fifth year, at the festival of deliverance which is held on the anniversary of victory, this writing of mine shall be read, that those who shall hear it with understanding may lay its warning to heart, and that the lessons of the great deliverance may never be forgotten among you. It was in the days before the beginning of peace that I, the test of you cast down and broken by the hand of the tyrant, conceived and created that which was known as the terror. The kings of the earth and their servants tremble before my invisible presence for my arm was long, and my hand was heavy. Yet no man knew where or when I would strike, only that the blow would be death to him on whom it shall fall, and that nowhere on earth should he find the safe refuge from it. In those days, the earth was ruled by force and cunning, and the nations were armed, camps set one against the other, millions of men, who had no quarrel with their neighbours, stood waiting for the word of their rulers to blast the fair fields of earth with the fires of war, and to make desolate the homes of those who had done them no wrong. In the third year of the 20th century, Richard Arnold, the Englishman, conquered the empire of the air, and made the first ship that flew as a bird does of its own strength and motion. He joined the brotherhood of freedom, then known among men as the terrorists of whom I, the test, was the master. And then he built the aerial fleet, which, in the day of Armageddon, gave us the victory of the tyrants of the earth. At the same time, Alan Trimain, a noble of the English people, into who soul I had caused my spirit to enter in order that he might serve me and bring the day of deliverance nearer, caused all the nations of the Anglo-Sexon race to join hands, from the west and to the east, in a league of common blood in Kindred, and they, in the appointed hour, stood between the sons and daughters of men and those who would have enslaved them a fresh. The chief of these was Alexander Romanoff, last of the Zahs or tyrants of Russia, whose armies lead with those of France, Italy, Spain, and certain lesser powers, and assisted by a great fleet of war balloons that could fly, those slowly, wherever they were directed, swept, like a destroying pestilence, from the western frontiers of Russia to the eastern shores of Britain, and when they had gained the mastery of Europe, invaded England, and laid siege to London. But here their path of conquest was brought to an end, for Alan Trimain and his brothers of the terror, called upon the men of Anglo-Sexondom, to save their mother land from her enemies, and they rose in their wrath, million strong, and fell upon them by land and sea, and would have destroyed them utterly, as I had bitten them to, but that Natasha, who was my daughter, and was known in those days as the angel of the Revolution pleaded for the remnant of them, and they were spared. But the Russians, we slew without mercy to the last man of those who had stood in arms against us, saving only the tyrant and his princes and the leaders of his armies. These we took prisoners and sent with their wives and their children to die in their own prison land in Siberia, as they had sent thousands of innocent men and women to die before them. This was my judgment upon them for the wrong they had done to me and mine. But in the hour of victory, I spared not those who had not known how to spare. Now they are dead, and their graves are nameless. Their names, they buy word among men for they were strong, and they used their strength to do evil. So we made an end of tyranny among the nations, and when the world war was at length brought to an end, we disbanded, all the armies that were upon the land and sank the warships that were left upon the sea, that men might no more fight with each other. War, that had been called honourables since the world began. We made a crime of blood guiltiness, for which the life of him who sought to commit it should pay, and as a crime, you, the children of those who have delivered the nations from it, shall forever hold it to be. We leave you the command of the air, and that is the command of the world, but should it come to pass such an progressive knowledge it may well do, but others in the world outside the area shall learn to navigate the air as you do. You shall go forth to battle with them, and destroy them utterly. For we have made it known through all the earth that he who seeks to build a second navy of the air, shall be accounted an enemy of peace. Whose purpose it is to bring war upon the earth again. Forget not that the blood lust is but tamed, not quenched in the souls of men, and that long years must pass before it is purged from the world forever. We have given peace on earth, until you, our children, we be quick the sacred trust of keeping it. We have won our world empire by force, and by force you must maintain it. In the day of battle we shed the blood of millions without Ruth to win it, and so far the end has justified the means we used. Since the sun set upon Armageddon, and the right to make war was taken from the rulers of the nations, we have governed a realm of peace and prosperity, which every year has seen better and happier than that which went before. No man has dared to draw the sword upon his brother, or by force or fraud to take that which was not his by right. The sila of earth has been given back to the use of her sons, and their wealth has already multiplied a hundredfold on every hand. Kings have ruled with wisdom and justice, and Senates have ceased their wranglings to sobly seek out, and promote the welfare of their own countries, and to win the respect and friendship of others. Yet many of these are the same men who but, a few years ago, rent each other like wild beasts in savage strife for the meanest ends. Who betrayed their brothers and slaughtered their neighbors, that the rich might be richer, and the strong stronger in the pitilist battle for wealth and power. They have become peaceful and honest with each other because we have compelled them to be so, and because they know that the penalty of wrongdoing in high places is destruction swift and certain as the stroke of the hand of fate itself. They know that no man stands so high that our hand cannot cast him down to the dust, and that no sport of earth is so secret and so distant, that the transgressor of our laws can find in it a refuge from our vengeance. We stand between the few strong and cunning who would oppress, and the many we can simple who could not resist them. And when we are gone, you will hear the voice of duty calling you to take our places. When you stand where we do now, remember who you are and the tremendous trust that is laid upon you. You are the children of the chosen out of many nations. Best is of the world and under heaven, the arbitous of human destiny. You shall rule the world as we have ruled it for a hundred years from now. If in that time men shall not have learnt the ways of wisdom and justice, you may be sure that they will never learn them. And deserve only to be left to their own foolishness. Since the world began, the path of life has never leans of fear and straight before the sons of men as it does now. And never was it so easy to do the right and so hard to do the wrong. So for a hundred years to come, you shall keep them in the path in which we have set them. And those that would will fully turn aside from it, you shall destroy without mercy. Let's they lead others into misery and bring the evil days upon earth again. At the twenty-fifth celebration of the festival of deliverance, you shall give back the septer of the world empire into the hands of the children of those from whom we took it. Because they wielded it for oppression and not for mercy. At that time, you shall make it known throughout the earth, but men are once more free to do good or evil according to their choice. And that as they choose well or ill, so shall they live or die. And well to them in those days if knowing the good, they shall turn aside to do evil. Beyond the clouds that gather over the sunset of my earthly life, I see a sign in heaven as of a flaming sword, whose health is in the hand of the master of destiny, and whose blade is outstretched over the habitations of men. As they shall choose to do good or evil, so shall that sword pass away from them or fall upon them, and consume them utterly in the midst of their pride. And if they, knowing the good, shall elect to do evil, it shall be with them as of all the prophet said of the men of Babylon, the great. Their cities shall be a desolation, a dry land and a wilderness, a land where in no man dwelleth, neither shall any son of man pass their by. For from among the stars of heaven, whose law I have learned and whose voices I have heard, they shall come the messenger of fate, and his shape shall be that of a flaming fire, and his breath as the breath of a pestence that men shall feel and die in the hour that it breathes upon them. Out of the depths beyond the light of the sun, he shall come, and your children of the fifth generation shall be hold as a brooch. The sister worlds shall see him pass with fear and trembling, wondering which of them he shall smite. But if he be not restrained or turned aside by the hand which guides the stars in their courses, it shall go hard with this world, and the men of it in the hour of his passing. Then shall a high ways of the earth be waste and the wayfaring of men cease. Earth's your languish and mourn for her children that are no more, and death's your reign amidst the silence, so sovereign of many lands. So long as you continue to walk in the way of wisdom shall live in peace until the end. Whether it shall come then or in the ages that you follow, and if it shall come then, you shall await it with fortitude. Knowing that this life is but a single link in the chain of existence which stretches through infinity. And that if you should be found worthy, you should be taught how or chosen few among your sons and daughters, shall survive the ruin of the world to be the parents of the new race and replenish the earth and possess it. Out to the valley of the shadow of death, I stretch forth my hands in blessing to you, the children of the coming time, and pray that the peace which the men of the generation now passing away have won through strife and toil in the fairies days of the terror, maybe yours, and endure unbroken, until the end.

4 SF stories by C. M. Kornbluth,C. M. Kornbluth,118444,5.0,"February 22, 2020",[],0,"eer, please visit librevox.org. Collected papers on analytical psychology by Carl Gustav Jung, translated by Constance Ellen Long, 1867 to 1923. Editors' preface to the second edition. The following papers have been gathered together from various sources, and are now available for the first time to English readers. The subject of psychoanalysis is much in evidence, and is likely to occupy still more attention in the near future, as the psychological content of the psychosis and neurosis is more generally appreciated and understood. It is of importance, therefore, that the fundamental writings of both the Viennese and Zurich schools should be accessible for study. Several of Freud's works have already been translated into English. Dr. Jung's, Von Lungen, whom symboled their libido was published in America in 1916 under the title of The Psychology of the Unconscious. That work, read in conjunction with these papers, offers a fairly complete picture of the scientific and philosophical standpoint of the leader of the Zurich school. It is the task of the future to judge and expand the findings of both schools and to work at the development of the new psychology, which is still in its infancy. It will be a relief to many students of the unconscious to see it in another aspect than that of a wild beast couched waiting its hour to spring. Some readers have gathered that view of it from the writings of the Viennese school, a view which is at most that dangerous thing, a half-truth. In the papers appearing for the first time in this edition, chapters 14 and 15, Dr. Jung develops his ideas of introversion and extroversion, a contribution of the first importance to psychology. He agrees with Freud in regarding the neurosis to be the result of repression, but differs in his view as to the origin of repression. He finds this to lie not in sexuality per se, but rather in man's natural tendency to adapt to the demands of life one sideedly, according to his type of mentality. The born extrovert adapts by means of feeling, thought being under repression and relatively infantile. The introverts' natural adaption is by means of thought, feeling being more or less repressed remains undeveloped. In either type, the neglected co-function is behind the adapted function. This inequality operating in the unconscious brings about a conflict, which in certain subjects amounts to a neurosis, and in others produces a limitation of individual development. This view shifts the interpretation of repression onto a much more comprehensive basis than that of sexuality, although there can scarcely be a repression that does not include this instinct on account of its deep and far-reaching importance in man. There is no doubt that some even scientific persons have a certain fear of whether the study of the unconscious may lead. These fearful persons should be reminded that they possess an unconscious and spite of themselves, and that they share it in common with every human being. It is an extension of the individual. To study it is to deepen the self. All new discoveries have at one stage can call dangerous, and all new philosophies have been deemed heresies. It is as though we would once more consign radium to its dust-teeps, less someday the new radian sea should overpower mankind. Indeed this particular thing has proved at once most dangerous and most precious. Man must learn to use his treasure and in using it to submit to its own laws, which can only become known when it is handled and investigated. Those who read this book with the attention it requires will find they gain an impression of many new truths. The second edition is issued towards the end of the third year of the Great European War at a time when much we have valued and held sacred is in the melting pot. But we believe that out of the crucible new forms will arise. The study of psychoanalysis produces something of the effect of a war in the psyche. Indeed we need to make conscious this war in the inner things of the mind and soul if we would be delivered in the future from war in the external world. There is a parallelism between individual and international neurosis. In the pain of the upheaval one recognizes the birthpings of newer and let us hope true or thought and more natural adaptations. We need a renewal of our philosophy of life to replace much that is perished in the general cataclysm and it is because I see in the analytical psychology which grows out of a scientific study of the unconscious the germs of such a new construction that I have gathered the following essays together. The translation is the work of various hands, the names of the different translators being given in a footnote at the beginning of each essay. For the editing I am responsible, the essays are as far as possible printed in chronological order and those readers who are sufficiently interested will be able to discern in them the gradual development of Dr. Young's present position in psychoanalysis. Constance E. Long, two Harley-Place West, June 1917. Author's preface to the second edition. In agreement with my honored collaborator Dr. C. E. Long, I have made certain additions to the second edition. It should especially be mentioned that new chapter upon the concept of the unconscious has been added. This is a lecture I gave early in 1916 before the Zurich Union for Analytical Psychology. It gives a general orientation of a most important problem in practical analysis, namely, of the relation of the psychological ego to the psychological non-ego. Chapter 14 has been fundamentally altered, and I've used the opportunity to incorporate an article that should describe the results of more recent researches. In accordance with my general mode of working, the description is as generalized as possible. My habit in my daily practical work is to combine myself for some time to studying my human material. I've been abstract as generalized a formula as possible from the data collected, obtaining from an appointment of view and applying it in my practical work until it has either been confirmed, modified, or elicibanded. If it has been confirmed, I publish it as a general viewpoint, without giving the empirical material. I only introduce the material amassed in the course of my practice in the form of example or illustration. I therefore beg the reader not to consider the views I present as mere fabrications of my brain. They are, as a matter of fact, the results of extensive experience and ripe reflection. These additions will enable the reader of the second edition to become familiar with the recent views of the Zurich School. As regards the criticism encountered by the first edition of this work, I was pleased to find my writings were received with much more open-mindedness among English critics than was the case in Germany, where they are met with the silence born of contempt. I'm particularly grateful to Dr. Agnes Seville for an exceptionally understanding criticism in the medical press. My thanks are also due to Dr. T.W. Mitchell for an exhaustive review in the proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. This critic takes exception to my heresy, respecting causality. He considers that I am entering upon a perilous, because on scientific course, when I question the sole validity of the causal viewpoint in psychology. I sympathize with him, but in my opinion the nature of the human mind compels us to take that final point of view. For it cannot be disputed that psychologically speaking, we are living and working day by day according to the principle of directed aim or purpose as well as that of causality. A psychological theory must necessarily adapt itself to this fact. What is plainly directed towards a goal cannot be given an exclusively causalistic explanation, otherwise we should be led to the conclusion expressed in Moleshot's famous annunciation. Man is what he eats. We must always bear the fact in mind that causality is a point of view. It affirms the inevitable and immutable relation of the series of events, A to B to D to Z. Since this relation is fixed and according to the viewpoint must necessarily be so, looked at logically the order may also be reversed. Finality is also a viewpoint that is justified empirically solely by the existence of series of events, wherein the causal connection is indeed evident, but the meaning of which only becomes intelligible as producing final effect. Ordinary daily life furnishes the best instances of this. The causal explanation must be mechanistic if we are not to postulate a metaphysical entity as first cause. For instance, if we adopt Freud's sexual theory and assign primary importance psychologically to the function of the genital glands, the brain is viewed as an appendage of the genital glands. If we approach the Viennese idea of sexuality with all its vague omnipotence and trace it in a strictly scientific manner down to its psychological basis, we shall arrive at the first cause, according to which psychic life is for the most or the most important part, tension and relaxation of the genital glands. If we assume for the moment that this mechanistic explanation would be true, it would be the sort of truth which is exceptionally tiresome and rigidly limited in scope. A similar statement would be that the genital glands cannot function without adequate nourishment, with its inference that sexuality is an appendage function of nutrition. The truth contained in this is really an important chapter in the biology of lower forms of life. But if we wish to work in a really psychological way, we shall want to know the meaning of psychological phenomena. After learning the kinds of steel, the various parts of a locomotive are made of, and from what iron works and mines they come, we do not really know anything about the locomotive's function that is to say it's meaning. But function, as conceived by modern science, is by no means solely a causal concept. It is especially a final or tealological one. For it is utterly impossible to consider the soul from a causal viewpoint only. We are obliged to consider it also from the final point of view. As Dr. Mitchell also points out, it is impossible for us to think of the causal determination conjoinply with a final connection. That would be an obvious contradiction, but our theory of cognition does not need to remain on a pre-contained level. It is well known that concerted very clearly that the mechanistic and the tealological viewpoints are not constituent, objective principles, in some degree qualities of the object, but that they are purely regulative, subjective principles of thought, and as such, they are not mutually inconsistent. I can, for example, easily conceive the following thesis and antithesis. Fesis. Everything came into existence according to mechanistic laws. Antithesis. Some things did not come into existence according to mechanistic laws only. Consists to this. Reason cannot prove either of these principles because a priori purely empirical laws of nature cannot give us a determinative principle regarding the potentiality of things. As a matter of fact, modern physics has necessarily been converted from the idea of pure mechanism to the final concept of the conservation of energy, because the mechanistic explanation only recognizes reversible processes, whereas the actual truth is that the process of nature is irreversible. This fact led to the concept of an energy that tends towards relief of tension, and therewith also towards a definite final state. Obviously, I consider both these points of unnecessary, the causal as well as the final, but would of the same time lay stress upon the fact that since constant, we have come to know that the two viewpoints are not antagonistic, if they are regarded as regulative principles of thought, and not as constituent principles of the process of nature itself. When speaking of the reviews, I must also mention those that seem to me beside the mark. I was once more struck by the fact that certain critics cannot distinguish between the theoretical explanation given by the author, and the fantastic ideas provided by the patient. One of my critics makes this confusion when discussing number dreams. The associations to the quotation from the Bible in chapter 5 are as every attentive reader must readily perceive, not arbitrary explanations of my own, but a cryptumnesic conglomeration emanating not from my brain at all, but from that of the patient. Surely it is not difficult to perceive upon reflection that this conglomeration of numbers corresponds exactly to that unconscious psychological function, from which preceded all the mysticism of numbers by thagoreach, cabalistic, and so forth existent from untold ages. I am grateful to my serious reviewers, and should like here to it also express my thanks to Mrs. Harold F. McCormick, for her generous help in the production of this book. C. G. Jung, June 1917. Authors' preference to the first edition. This volume contains a selection of articles and pamphlets on analytical psychology, written at intervals during the past 14 years. These years have seen the development of a new discipline, and, as is usual in such a case, have involved many changes of viewpoint of concept and of formulation. It is not my intention to give a presentation of the fundamental concepts of analytical psychology in this book. It throws some light, however, on a certain line of development, which is especially characteristic of the Zurich school of psychoanalysis. As is well known, the merit of the discovery of the new analytical method of general psychology belongs to Professor Freud of Vienna. His original viewpoints had to undergo many essential modifications, some of them owing to the work done at Zurich, in spite of the fact that he himself is far from agreeing with the standpoint of the school. I am unable to explain fully the fundamental differences between the two schools, but would indicate the following points. The Vienna School takes the standpoint of an exclusive sexualistic conception, while that of the Zurich school is symbolistic. The Vienna School interprets the psychological symbol semiotically, as a sign or token of certain primitive psycho-sexual processes. It's method is analytical and causal. The Zurich School recognizes the scientific feasibility of such a conception, but denies its exclusive validity, for it does not interpret the psychological symbol semiotically only, but also symbolistically. That is, it attributes a positive value to the symbol. The value does not depend merely on historical causes. It's chief importance lies in the fact that it has a meaning for the actual present and for the future, in their psychological aspects. For to the Zurich School, the symbol is not merely a sign of something repressed and concealed, but is at the same time an attempt to comprehend and to point out the way of further psychological development of the individual. Thus we add a prospective import to the retrospective value of the symbol. The method of the Zurich School is therefore not only analytical and causal, but also synthetic and prospective. In recognition that the human mind is characterized by cause and also by fienes, aims. The latter fact needs particular emphasis because there are two types of psychology, the one following the principle of hedonism and the other following the principle of power. Scientific materialism is pertinent to the former type and the philosophy of Nietzsche to the latter. The principle of the Freudian theory is hedonism, while that of Adler, one of Freud's earliest personal pupils, is founded upon the principle of power. The Zurich School, recognizing the existence of these two types, also remarked by the late Professor William James, considers that the views of Freud and Adler are one-sided, and only valid within the limits of their corresponding type. Both principles exist within every individual, but not in equal proportions. Thus it is obvious that each psychological symbol has two aspects, and should be interpreted according to the two principles. Freud and Adler interpret in the analytical and causal way, reducing to the infantile and primitive. Thus with Freud the conception of the aim is the fulfillment of desire, with Adler as the Ursur patient of power. Both authors take the standpoint in their practical analytical work, which brings to view only infantile and gross egoistic aims. The Zurich School is convinced of the fact that within the limits of a diseased mental attitude, the psychology is such as Freud and Adler describe. It is indeed just on account of such impossible and childish psychology that the individual is in a state of inward dissociation and hence neurotic. The Zurich School therefore, in agreement with them so far, also reduces the psychological symbol, the fantasy products of the patient, to the fundamental infantile hedonism, or to the infantile desire for power. But Freud and Adler contend themselves with the result of mere reduction, according to their scientific biologism and naturalism. But here, a very important question arises. Can man obey the fundamental and primitive impulses of his nature, without gravely injuring himself or his fellow beings? He cannot assert either his sexual desire or his desire for power unlimitedly, and the limits are more over very restricted. The Zurich School has in view also the final result of analysis, and regards the fundamental thoughts and impulses of the unconscious as symbols, indicative of a definite line of future development. We must admit there is, however, no scientific justification for such a procedure, because our present-day science is based as a whole upon causality. But causality is only one principle, and psychology essentially cannot be exhausted by causal methods only, because the mind lives by aims as well. Besides this disputable philosophical argument, we have another of much greater value in favor of our hypothesis, namely, that of vital necessity. It is impossible to live according to the intimations of infantile hedonism, or according to a childish desire for power. If these are to be retained, they must be taken symbolically. Out of the symbolic application of infantile trends, an attitude evolves which may be termed philosophic or religious, and these terms characterize sufficiently the lines of further development of the individual. The individual is not only an established and unchangeable complex of psychological facts, but also an extremely changeable entity. By exclusive reduction to causes, the primitive trends of a personality are reinforced. This is only helpful when at the same time these primitive tendencies are balanced by recognition of their symbolic value. Analysis and reduction lead to causal truth. This by itself does not help living, but brings about resignation and hopelessness. On the other hand, the recognition of the intrinsic value of a symbol leads to constructive truth and helps us to live. It induces hopefulness and furtheres the possibility of future development. The functional importance of the symbol is clearly shown in the history of civilization. For thousands of years, the religious symbol proved a most efficacious means in the moral education of mankind. Only a prejudice mind could deny such an obvious fact. Concrete values cannot take the place of a symbol. Only new and more efficient symbols can be substituted for those that are antiquated and outworn, such as have lost their efficacy through the progress of intellectual analysis and understanding. The further development of mankind can only be brought about by means of symbols, which represent something far in advance of himself, and whose intellectual meanings cannot get be grasped entirely. The individual unconscious produces such symbols, and they are of the greatest possible value in the moral development of the personality. Man almost invariably has philosophical and religious views of the meaning of the world and of his own life. There are some who are proud to have none. Visa exceptions outside the common path of mankind. They miss an important function which has proved itself to be indispensable to the human mind. In such cases we find the unconscious, instead of modern symbolism, an antiquated archaic view of the world and of life. If a requisite psychological function is not represented in the sphere of consciousness, it exists in the unconscious in the form of an archaic or embryonic prototype. This brief resume may show what the reader cannot find in this collection of papers. The essays are stations on the way of the more general views developed above. CG-Yun-Zurik, January 1916.

Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology,Carl Gustav Jung,73571,13.0,"November 29, 2020",[],0,"ox.org. For science fiction stories by CM Cornbluff, story number 1, the adventurer. This story was first published in Space Science Fiction, May 1953. President Fulton 24th said, patiently, to his secretary of the treasure, whoa, me'd I, hell, minister, if I understand a single word of that. Why can't I buy the Nicolade's collection? And don't start with a rediscount of the series W-Binus again. Just tell me why. The secretary of the treasure he said, with an air of apprehension, an a thread like feeling across his throat, it boils down to no money, Mr. President. The president was too engrossed in thoughts of the marvelous collection to fly into a rage. It's such a bargain, he said, morply, and archaic Henry Morphigier really too big to finger, but I know culture snob, thank God, and 15 early morons, and I can't begin to tell you what else. He looked hopefully at the secretary of public opinion, mightn't I see it for the public good or something? The secretary of public opinion shook his head. His prose was roughly professional. Not a chance, Mr. President. We'd never get away with it. The art lovers would scream to high heaven. I suppose so. Why isn't there any money? He has swivel dangerously on the secretary of the treasure again. There are purchases of the new series, W Bond issue have lagged badly, because potential buyers have been attracted to stop bits, stop bits, stop it. You know I can't make out a tale of that stuff. Where is the money going? The director of the budget said cautiously. Mr. President, a duringsie by anium just ending, the Department of Defense accounted for 78% of expenditures. The secretary of defense growled. No way a minute, Felder. We were voted. The President interrupted raging weekly. How you rascals might follow what I've known what to do with you, but don't think I can't handle it. Don't think you can hood-wink me. He punched a button for rociously. His silly face was contorted with rage, and there was a certain tension on all the faces around the cabinet table. Fulfill slid down abruptly in the walls, revealing grim-faced secret servicemen. Each cabinet officer was covered by at least two automatic rifles. Take that, that traitor away. The President yelled. His finger pointed at the secretary of defense, who slumped over the table sobbing. Two secret servicemen have carried him from the room. Then Fulfill some the 24th, leaned back, thrusting out his lower lip. He told the secretary of the treasury, get me the money for the Nicolade's collection. Do you understand? I don't care how you do it. Get it. Be glad at the secretary of public opinion. Have you any comments? No, Mr. President. All right then. The President unbent and said plaintively. I don't see why you can't all be more reasonable. I'm a very reasonable man. I don't see why I can't have a few pleasure along with my responsibilities. Really, I don't. And I'm sensitive. I don't like these scenes. Very well. That's all. The cabinet meeting is adjourned. They rose and left silently in the order of their seniority. The President noticed that the panels were still down and pushed the button that raised them again and hid the granite face secret servicemen. He took out of his pocket, he laid Morris and fingering peace and turned it over in his hand, a smile of relaxation and bliss spreading over his face. Such a muzing textural contrast such unexpected variations on the classic sequences. The cabinet, less the secretary of defense, was holding a rump meeting in an untapped corner of the White House gymnasium. God, the secretary of state said, White faced, poor old Willie. The professorialy gruff secretary of public opinion said, we should murder the bastard. I don't care what happens. The director of the budget said, dryly, we all know what would happen. The bill said, and full sum the 25th would take office. No, we've got to keep plugging as before. Nothing short of the invincible can topple the republic. What about a war? The secretary of Commerce demanded fiercely. We've no proof that our program will work. What about a war? State said, we're early. Not while there is a balance of power in my dear man. The I-O-Colist-O question proved that the republic and the Soviet fell all over themselves trying to patch things up as soon as it seemed that would be real shooting. Folsom the 24th and his excellency premier, Yersensky, no at least that much. The secretary of the treasury said, what do you think of Stiner for defense? He directs her on the budget was astonished. What do you take it? Treasury cleared his throat. As a matter of fact, I've asked him to stop by right now. He hurled a medicine ball into the budgetary gut. Oh, said the director. You bastard. Spiner would be perfect. He runs standard like a watch. He treacherously fired the medicine ball at the secretary of raw materials, who blandly caught it in slammed it back. Here he comes, said the secretary of raw materials. Stiner, come and switch them all off. Stiner ambled over a SWAT man in his 50s and said, I don't mind if I do. Where's Willie? State said, the president unmasked him as a traitor. He's probably been executed by now. Stiner looked grim and grim or yet when the secretary of treasury said, dead pan. We want to propose you for defense. I'm happy and standards, Stiner said, safer to. The man's father took an interest in science, but the man never comes around. Things are very quiet. Why don't you invite Winch from the National Archimission? It wouldn't be much of a change for the worse for him. No brains. The secretary of raw materials said briefly. Pads up. Stiner caught the ball and slugged it back at him. What good are brains he asked quietly? Close the ranks gentlemen, state said, these long shots are too hard on my arms. The ranks closed and the cabinet told Stiner what good were brains. He ended by accepting. The moon is all republic. Mars is all Soviet. Titan is all republic. Enemy is all Soviet. But Iow and Calisto by the treaty of Grinich or half and half republic and Soviet. Down the main street of the principal settlement of Iow runs an invisible line. On one side of the line the principal settlement is known as New Pittsburgh. On the other side it is known as Niznitogorski. Two-way miners home in New Pittsburgh one night and a year-old boy named Grayson staggered bleeding from the head. His eyes were swollen almost shut. His father lured to his feet knocking over a bottle. He looked stupidly at the bottle, said it upright too late to save much of the alcohol, and then stared fixedly at the boy. Say what you made me do you little bastard. He grould and fetched the boy a clout on his bleeding head that sent him spinning against the wall of the hut. The boy got up slowly and silently. There seemed to be something wrong with his left arm and glowered at his father. He said nothing. Fiting again. The father said in a would-be fierce voice. His eyes fell under the peculiar fire in the boy's stare. Damn, fool. A woman came in from the kitchen. She was tall and thin. And a flat voice he said to the man. Get out of here. The man hiccup can said. Your brat spilled my bottle. Give me a dollar. In the same flat voice I have to buy food. I said give me a dollar. The man slapped her face. It did not change. And wrenched a small purse from the string that suspended it around her neck. The boy suddenly was a demon flying at his father with fists and teeth. It lasted only a second or two. The father kicked him into a corner where he lay still glaring, worthless and dry-eyed. The mother had not moved. Her husband's handmark was still rather her face when he hulked out clutching the money bag. Mishr's grace and at last crouched in the corner with the eight-year-old boy. Little Tommy, she said softly. My little Tommy, did you cross the line again? He was blabbering in her arms hysterically as she caressed him. That last he was able to say, I didn't cross the line, Mom. At this time, it was in school. They said our name was really... Crescensky. God damn him. The boy shrieked. They said his grandfather was named Crescensky and he moved over the line and changed his name to grace and God damn him doing that to us. Now darling, his mother said, caressing him. Now darling, his trembling began to air. She said, let's get out the spools, Tommy. You must in fall behind in school. You owe that to me, don't you darling? Yes, Mom. He said, he threw his spindly arms around her and kissed her. Get out the spools. We'll show him. I mean, them... President Fulzum the 24th lay on his deathbed, feeling no pain, mostly because his personal physician had pumped him full of morphine. Dr. Barnes sat by the bed, holding the presidential wrist and waiting. Occasionally nodding off and recovering with a belligerent stare around the room. V4, wire servicemen didn't care whether he fell asleep or not. They were worriedly discussing the nature and habits of the president's first born, who would shortly succeed to the highest office in the Republic. A firebrand, they tell me, the AP man said unhappily. Firebrand's iron old mind, the UP man said, he can send out all the inflammatory notes he wants, just as long as he isn't the fiend for exercise. I'm not as young as I once was. U-boys wouldn't remember the old president Fulzum the 22nd. He used to do point to point hiking. He worshiped old FDR. The I-NS man said, lowering his voice, then he was worshiping the wrong Roosevelt. Teddy was the athlete. Dr. Barnes started, dropped the presidential wrist and held a mirror to the mouth for a moment. Gentlemen, he said, the president is dead. Oh, okay. The AP man said, let's go boys, I'll send in the flash. UP, you go cover the college of electors, I-NS get onto the president elect, trip, collect the interviews and background, the door opened abruptly, a kernel of infantry was standing there, breathing hard with an automatic rifle at port. Is he dead? He asked, yes, the AP man said, if you let me past, nobody leaves the room. The kernel said, grimly, I represent general, slow-comb acting president of a public, the college of electors is acting now to ratify a burst of gunfire caught the kernel in the back. He spun and fell with a single horse cry, more gunfire sounded through the White House, a secret service man ducked his head through the door. President's dead? You boys, they put, we'll have this thing cleaned up in an hour. He vanished. He doctor, spotted his alarm and the newsman ignored him with professional poise. The AP man said, now who's slow-comb? Defense command? I-NS said, I remember him, at three stars. He headed up the tactical airborne force out in Kansas four or five years ago. I think he was retired since then. A phosphorous grenade crashed through the window and exploded with a globe of yellow flame the size of a basketball. Against clouds of phosphorous pitoxide gushed from it, and the sprinkler system switched on, drenching the room. Come on, hack the AP man, and they scrambled from the room and slam the door. The doctor's coat was burning in two or three places and he was wretched febally on the corridor floor. They tore his coat off and flung it back into the room. The UP man swearing horribly, dog a sizzling bit of phosphorous from the back of his hand with a pin-knife and collapsed sweating when it was out. The I-NS man passed him a flask and he gurgled down half a pint of liquor. Who flying that brick? He asked faintly. Nobody. The AP man said gloomily. That's the hell of it. None of this is happening. Thus the way tapped the pretender never happened in O3, thus the way the Pentagon knew to knee never happened in 67, 68. The UP man said, faintly, it didn't happen in 68, not 67. The AP man smashed a fist into the palm of his hand and swore. God damn, he said. Some day I'd like to. He broke off and was bitterly silent. The UP man must have been a little dislocated with shock and quite drunk to talk the way he did. Me too, he said. Like to tell the story, maybe it was 67, not 68. I'm not sure now. Can't write it down so the details get lost and then after a while it didn't happen at all. Revolution would be good deal, but it takes people to make revolution. People with eyes and ears and memories, we make things not happen and we make people not see and not hear. He slumped back against the corridor wall, nursing his burned hand. The others were watching him very rescheduled. Then the AP man caught sight of the Secretary of Defense striding down the corridor, flanked by secret servicemen. A Mr. Steiner, he called, what's the picture? I'm a stopped breathing heavily and said, slow comes barricaded in the oval study. They don't want to smash in. He's about the only one left. They were only 50 or so. The acting presidents taking charge at the study. You want to come along? They did. And even haul the UP man after them. The acting president, who would be president, falls in the 25th as soon as the Electoral College got around to it. At his father's face, the petulant lip, the soft jowl on a hard young body. He also had an auto rifle ready to fire from the hip, most of the cabin it was present. When the Secretary of Defense arrived, he turned on him. Steiner, he said, nastily, can you explain why there should be a rebellion against the Republic in your department? Mr. President, Steiner said, slow comes was retired on my recommendation. In two years ago, it seemed to me that my responsibility ended there and security should have taken over. The president, Alex Finger, left the trigger of the auto rifle and his lip drew in a little. Quite so. He said, currently, and turned to the door. Slow him. He shouted, come out of there. We can use gas if we want. The door opened unexpectedly, and a tired looking man with three stars on each shoulder to their bare-handed. All right, he said, girly, that I was full enough to think something could be done about the regime, but you, fat, faced, impassils are going to go on and on, and the start of the auto rifle, cut him off. The president, Alex, knuckles, were white as he clutched the pieces for warm and grip. The chariot of slugs continued to hack and plow the general's body until the magazine was empty. Burned that, he said, currently, turning his back on it. Back to Barnes come here. I want to know about my father's passing. The doctor, horse and red eyed from the whiff of phosphorous smoke spoke with him. The UP man had staggered drunkenly into a chair, but the other newsman noted that Dr. Barnes glanced at them as he spoke in a confidential murmur. Thank you, doctor. The president, Alex, said it last decisively. He gestured to a secret servicemen. Take those traders away. They went, numbly. The secretary of stake, clear to his throat. Mr. President, he said, I take this opportunity to submit the resignations of myself and fellow cabinet members according to custom. That's all right. The president, Alex, said, you may as well stay on. I intend to run things myself anyway. He after the auto rifle. You, he said to the secretary of public opinion, you have some work to do. Have the memory of my father's artistic preoccupations obliterated as soon as possible. I wish to republ it to assume a warlike posture. Yes, what is it? A trembling messenger said, Mr. President, I have the honor to inform you that the college of electors has elected you, president of the republic, unanimously. Kiddet, fourth classman, Thomas Grayson, lay on his bunk, and sobbed in an agony of loneliness. The letter from his mother was crumpled in his hand. Prouder than words can tell of your appointment to the academy darling. I hardly knew my grandfather, but I know that you will serve as brilliantly as he did to the eternal credit of the republic. You must be brave and strong for my sake. He would have given everything he had or ever could hope to have to be back with her and away from the bleeding, snoring fellow cadets of the core. He kissed the letter, and then hastily shoved it under his mattress as he heard footsteps. He popped to a brace, but it was only his roommate, Ferguson. Ferguson was from Earth and rejoiced in the lighter lunar gravity, which was punishment to Grayson's I.O. bread muscles. Rest, Mr. Ferguson, Grind. Thought it was night inspection. Any minute now, dare down the hall? Let me tighten your bunk all you'll be in trouble. Tightening the bunk he pulled out the letter and said, Calvishly. Ah, ha, who was she and opened it? When the cadet officers reached the room, they found Ferguson on the floor, being strangled black in the face by spider-reel little Grayson. It took all three of them to pull him off. Ferguson went to the infirmary and Grayson went to the common-dance office. The common dot layered at the cadet from under the most spectacular pair of eyebrows in the service. Good at Grayson? He said, explain what occurred. Sir, could that Ferguson begin to read a letter from my mother without my permission? That is not accepted by the core as grounds for may him. Do you have anything further to say? Sir, I lost my temper. All I thought of was that it was an act of disrespect to my mother and somehow to the core and the Republic to. That cadet Ferguson was dishonoring the core. Bush-wash, the commander thought, a snow job and a crude one. He studied the youngster. He had never seen such a brace from an I-O-Bred fourth-classman. It must be torture to muscles not yet toughened up to even lunar gravity. Five minutes more in the bar would have to give way and serve him right for showing off. He studied Grayson's folder. It was too early to tell about academic work, but the fourth-classman was a bear or a fool for extra duty. He had gone out for half a dozen teams and applied for membership in the exacting math club and writing club. The common-dont classed up. Grayson was still in his extreme brace. The common-dont suddenly had the queer idea. The Grayson could hold it until it killed him. One hundred hours of packed real he barked to be completed before quarter-term. Cadet Grayson, if you succeed in walking off your tours, remember that there is a tradition of fellowship in the core which his members are expected to observe. Just mess. After Grayson's steel sharp salute and exit, the common-dont dug deeper into the folder. Apparently there was something wrong with the voice left arm, but it had been passed by the examining team that visited Iow most unusual. Most too regular. But nothing could be done about it now. The president, softer now in body than on his election day and infinitely more cautious, stepped. It's all very well to create an incident, but where's the money to come from? Who wants the rest of Iow anyway? And what will happen if there's war? As he said, the hoarders will supply the money, Mr. President, a system of percentage boundaries for people who report currency hoarders, and then in forced purchase of a bond issue. Raw material said, we need that our and Mr. President, we need it desperately. State said, all our evaluations indicate that the soviet premiere would consider nothing less than armed invasion of his continental borders as an occasion for all out war. The consumer goods party in the soviet has gained immensely during the past five years, and of course, their armaments have suffered. Your true directive to put the Republic in a warlike posture has borne fruit, Mr. President. President Fulson, the 25th, studied them narrowly. To him the need for a border incident culminating in a forced purchase of soviet Iow did not seem as pressing as they thought, but they were after all specialists, and there was no conceivable way they could benefit from it personally. The only alternative was that they were offering their professional advice, and that it would be best to heat it. Still there was a vague nagging something. Now, since he decided the spy dossiers on his cabinet showed nothing but the usual. One had been blackmailed by an actress after an affair and railroader off the earth. Another had a habit of taking bribes to advance favourite sons in civil and military service, and so on, their Republic could not suffer at their hands. The Republic and the dynasty were impregnable. You simply spied on everybody, including the spies, and orders summary executions often enough to show that you meant it, and kept the public ignorant, deaf, dumb, blind ignorant. The spy system was simplicity itself. You had only to let things get as tangled and confused as possible until nobody knew who was who. The executions were literally no problem, for guilt their innocence made no matter. And mine control when there were four newspapers, six magazines, and three radio and television stations was a job for a handful of clerks. No, the cabinet wasn't getting away with anything. The system was unbeatable. President Fulcim the 25th said, very well, have it done. Andrew's Grayson, widow of new Pittsburgh, Iold, disappeared one night. It was in all the papers and on all the broadcasts. Sometime later she was found dragging herself back across the line between Niznie, Med Nidal Gorsk, and new Pittsburgh in sorry shape. She had a charitable tale to tell about what she has suffered at the hands and so forth of the Magnetic Gorsnix. A diplomatic note from the Republic to the Soviet was answered by another note, which was answered by the dispatch of the Republic's first fleet to Io, which was answered by the dispatch of the Soviets first and fifth leaps to Io. The Republic's first fleet blew up the customary deserted target hulk, foam-nated over a sneak sabotage attack and moved in its destroyers. Battle was joined. Hansen Thomas Grayson took over the command of his destroyer when its captain was killed on his bridge. An electrified crew saw the strange, brooding youngster perform tragedies of skill and courage and responded to them. In one week of desultory action the battered destroyer had accounted for seven Soviet destroyers and a cruiser. As soon as this penetrated to the flagship Grayson was decorated and given a floatilla. His weird magnetism extended to every officer and man aboard the seven craft. They struck like phantoms, cutting al cruisers and battle wagons and while on Orthodox actions that couldn't have succeeded but did every time. Grayson was badly wounded twice, but his driving nervous energy carried him through. He was decorated again and given the battle wagon of an alien force stripper. His out orders he touched down on the Soviet side of Io, led out a landing party of marines and blue jackets, cut through two regiments of Soviet infantry and returned to his battle wagon with prisoners, the top civil and military administrators of Soviet Io. They discussed him nervously aboard the flagship. He has a mystical quality admiral. His smith would follow him into an atomic furnace. And I always believe he could bring them through safely if he wanted to. The laugh was nervous. He doesn't look like much, but when he turns on the charm, watch out. He's a winner. No, I wonder what I meant by that. I know what you mean. They turn up every cell often. People who can't be stopped. People who have everything, Napoleon's, Alexander's, Stalin's, up from nowhere. Solomon, Hitler, fulls him the first, gangas' con. Well, let's get it over with. They tugged at their gold-braided jackets and sigild of the honor guard. Grayson was piped aboard, received another decoration and another speech. This time he made a speech in return. President Tholson the 25th, not knowing what else to do, had summoned his cabinet. Well, he rasted at the Secretary of Defense. The prisoner said with a fainst rug. Mr. President, there was nothing to be done. He has the fleet. He has the broadcasting facilities. He has the people. People, snorled at President. His finger jabbed at a button and the wall panel snapped down to show the secret service man standing in their niches. But finger shot tremulously out at the stoner. Kill that traitor. He raved. The chief of the detail said unheasily. Mr. President, we were listening to Grayson before we came on duty. He said he's day-fucked-o President now. Kill him. Kill him. The chief went on doggyly. And we liked what he had to say about the republic. And he said citizens of the republic shouldn't take orders from you. And he relieved you. The president fell back. Mr. President walked in wearing his plain instance uniform and smiling faintly. Admirals and four strippers flanked him. The chief of the detail said, Mr. Grayson, are you taking over? The man and the instance uniform said, gravely. Yes. And just call me Grayson, please. The titles come later. You can go now. The chief gave a pleased grin and collected his detail. The rather slight youngest man who had something wrong with one arm was in charge, complete charge. Grayson said, Mr. Folsom, you are relieved of the presidency. Captain, take him out and he finished with a whimsical shrug. A portley four stripper took Folsom by one arm. Like a drug man, the depose president let himself be let out. Grayson looked around the table. Who are you, gentlemen? They felt his magnetism, like the hum when you pass a power station. Steiner was the spokesman. Grayson, he said soberly. We are Folsom's cabinet. However, there is more that we have to tell you, alone if you will allow it. Very well, gentlemen. Admirals and captains backed out, looking concerned. The liner said, Grayson, the story goes back many years. My predecessor, will you Melvin determine to overthrow the regime, holding that it was enough front to the human spirit. There have been many such attempts. All have broken up on the rocks of espionage, terrorism and opinion control. The three weapons which the regime holds firmly in its hands. The vurn tried another approach that espionage versus espionage, terrorism versus terrorism and opinion control versus opinion control. He determined to use the basic fact that certain men make history, that there are men born to be mole breakers. There are the Phillips of Macedon, the Napoleon's, Stalin's and Hitler's, the Sulemon's, the adventurers. Again, then again, they flash across history, bringing down an ancient empire, turning ordinary soldiers of the line into unkillable demons of battle, uprooting cultures, breathing new life into more abundant peoples. There are common denominators among all the adventurers, intelligence, of course. Other things are more mysterious, but are always present. They are foreigners. Napoleon the Corsican, Hitler the Austrian, Stalin the Georgian, Philip the Macedonian. Always there is an edifice complex. Always there is physical deficiency. Napoleon's statue, Stalin's wither norm and yours. Always there is a minority disability real or fancy. This is a shock to you, Grayson, but you must face it. You were manufactured. Over and packed the cabinet with the slightest double dealers he could find, and they went to work. 86 infants were planted on the outposts of the Republic, in simulated family environments. Your mother was not your mother, but one of the most brilliant actresses ever to drop out of sight on earth. Your intelligence heredity was so good that we couldn't turn you down for lack of a physical deficiency. We, whether you're armed with gamma radiation, I hope you will forgive us. There was no other way. Of the 86, you are the one that worked. Somehow the combination for you was mind-eutely different from all the other combinations genetically or environmentally, and it worked. That is all we were after. The mold has been broken. You now know what you are. Let come whatever chaos is to come. The dead hand of the past no longer lies on us. Grayson with the door and beckoned to captains came in, Stiner broke off his speeches, Grayson said to them, these men deny my godhood, take them out and he finished with a whimsical shrug. Yes, your divinity said the captains without a trace of humor in their voices.

In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without the form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the body. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, let the light and bear was light. And God saw the light, that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear. And it was so. And God called the dry land earth. And the gathering together of the waters called he sees. And God saw that it was good. And God said, let the earth bring forth grass, the earth yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth. And it was so. And the earth brought forth grass and earth yielding seed after his kind. And the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself after his kind. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. And God said, let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them before signs and for seasons and for days and years. And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth. And it was so. And God made two great lights. The greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. And God said, let the water spring forth abundantly, the moving creature that had life, and found that my fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales and every living creature that moved with which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged foul after his kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let foul multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind. And it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind. And everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind. And God saw that it was good. And God said, let us make men in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created men in his own image. In the image of God created him, male and female created he them. And God blessed them and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subduet and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that mureth upon the earth. And God said, behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth. And every tree in the which is the fruits of a tree yielding seed. To you it shall be for me. And God do every beast of the earth and do every foul of the air and do everything that creepeth upon the earth bearing their ears life. I have given every green herb for me and it was so. And God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the six day. Chapter 2 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day and sang to fight it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. And the bees were the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and heavens. And every plant of the fields before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew. For the Lord God had not cost it to reign upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made to the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of God and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from then it was parted and became into four heads. And the name of the first is Paison, which is a composite of the whole land of Havala, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good. There is petroleum and the onix stone. And the name of the second river is Gaihan, the same as it is that composite of the whole land of Ethiopia. And the name of the third river is Haidukau, which is a geothermal toward the east of Syria. And the fourth river is Hufeiti's. And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man saying, of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat. But of the tree of the knowledge of God and evil thou shalt not eat of it. Or in the day that thou eatest thou shalt surely die. And the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him unhelp me to for him. And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them. And whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name of the wrath. An Adam gave names to all cattle and to the foul of the air and to every beast of the field. But, for Adam there was not found and now beneath for him. The Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead of the wrath and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. Their fore shall amand leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife. And they shall be one flesh. And they both were naked the man in his wife and were not ashamed. Chapter 3 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, ye, have God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden. And the woman said unto the serpent, we made of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God had said, ye shall not eat of it. And either shall he touch it, less he die. And the serpent said unto the woman, ye shall not surely die. For God, don't know that in the day he eat their off. Then your eyes shall be opened and he shall be as gods knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took up the fruit thereof and did eat. And gave also unto her husband's with her and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened. And they knew that they were naked, and they sobed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. And they heard the forests of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, where art thou? And he said, I heard of I voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself. And he said, who told thee that that was to naked? Has thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, the woman whom now gave us to be with me, she gave me the tree and I did eat. And the Lord God said unto the woman, what is this that thou has to done? And the woman said, the serpent beguiled me and I did eat. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou has to done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field, upon by belly shallt thou go and dust shallt thou eat all the days of thy life? And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed, it shall bruised thy head, and thou shallt bruise his heel. unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow thou shallt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, because thou has hardened unto the force of thy wife, and has eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, thou shallt not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thysic. In sorrow shallt thou eat of it all the days of thy life? Farns all so and thysols shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shallt eat the herb of the field? In the sweat of thy face shallt thou bread, till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thound taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust shallt thou return. And Adam called his wife's name, Eve, because she was the mother of all living. unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them, and the Lord God said, behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now, last he put forth his hand, and to take also of the tree of life and eat, and to live forever. Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to tell the ground from the wince he was taken. So he drove out of the man, and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden, cherubimbs, and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. Chapter 4. And Adam knew Eve his life, and she conceived, and bear came, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord, and she again bear his brother, Able, and Able was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tailor of the ground, and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought at the fruit of the ground, and offering unto the Lord. And Able, he also brought of the first length of his flock, and of the fat of the rave, and the Lord had respect unto Able, and to his offering, but unto Cain and to his offering, he had not respect, and Cain was very wrought, and his countenance fell, and the Lord said unto Cain, why are to thou wrath, and why is thy countenance fallen, if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted, and if thou doest not well, sin lyeth at the door, and unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shall to rule over him, and Cain talked with Able his brother, and it came to pass, when they were in the field, but Cain rose up against Able his brother, and slew him, and the Lord said to Cain, why is Able thy brother, and he said, I know not, I'm a eye my brother's keeper, and he said, what hast thou done, the force of thy brother's blood cryeth unto me from the ground, and now ought thou cursed from the earth, which have opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from by hand, when thou tillest put the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee, her strength, a fugitive, and a vagabond shall tell thee in the earth, and Cain sat under the Lord. My punishment is greater than I could bear, behold thou hast to driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy facial I be hid, and I shall be a fugitive, and a vagabond in the earth, and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me, and the Lord sat unto him. Therefore, whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him, sevenfold, and the Lord set a mark upon King, last any find in him should kill him, and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of Eden, and Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bear, inoc, and he built it a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, inoc. And unto inoc was born Iraad, and Iraad begat my Uchail, and my Hushail begat my Fusiel, and my Fusiel begat, Lamed, and Lamed took unto him two wives. The name of the one was Aida, and the name of the other Zilla, and Aida bear, J.Bow, he was the father of such as Duel Intense, and of such as Hav Cattle, and his brother's name was Tubeau, he was the father of all such as Handel, the Harb and Orgin, and Zilla, she also bear Tubeau King, and instruct her of every artifice her in brass and iron, and the sister of Tubeau King was Nehma. And Lamed said unto his wives, Aida and Zilla, her my voice he wives of Lamed, harking unto my speech, for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my heart, if Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamed, seventy and sevenfold, and Adam knew his wife again, and she bear a son, and called his name Seth, for God said she, I have appointed me another seed instead of able whom Tain slew, and to Seth, to him also there was born a son, and he called his name, Enaus, then began men to call upon the name of the Lord. Chapter five, this is the book of the generations of Adam, in the day that God created man, in the likeness of God, made he him, male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. The Adam lived in 130 years, and we got a son and his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth. And at the days of Adam after he had to be caught in Seth, where 800 years, and he began sons and daughters, and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died, and Seth lived on 105 years and we got heeness, and Seth lived after he got heeness, eight hundred and seven years, and we got sons and daughters. Then all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died, and he nest lived ninety years, and we get kind and and he nest lived after he got kind and eight hundred and fifty years, and we got sons and daughters, and all the days of enus were nine hundred and five years, and he died, and kind and lived seventy years, and we get a hallelujah, and can and lived after he got to Mahalalio eight hundred and forty years, and we got sons and daughters, and all the days of kind and where nine hundred and ten years, and he died, and Mahalalio lived sixty and five years, and we got to charity, and Mahalalio lived after he got to charity, eight hundred and thirty years, and we got sons and daughters, and all the days of Mahalalio were eight hundred, ninety and five years, and he died, and charity lived on hundred and sixty and two years, and he be got he not, and charity lived after he got he not, eight hundred years, and we got sons and daughters, and all the days of charity were nine hundred and sixty and two years, and he died, and he not lived sixty and five years, and we got methusala, and he not walked with God after he'd be got methusala, three hundred years, and we got sons and daughters, and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years, and Enoch walked with God, and he was not for God to come, and methusala lived on hundred, eight and seven years, and we got to Lamek, and methusala lived after he'd be got to Lamek, seven hundred, eight, and two years, and we got to sons and daughters, and all the days of him through Salah were nine hundred, sixty and nine years, and he died, and Lamek lived on hundred and eighty, and two years, and we got to son, and he called his name, Noah, saying, this same shall comfort us concerning our work and tutorial of our hands because of the ground which the Lord had cursed, and Lamek lived after he'd be got to know our five hundred, ninety, and five years, and we got to sons and daughters, and all the days of Lamek were seventy and seven years, and he died, and Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah, be got shem, ham, and japhat, chapter six, and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, that's the sons of God, saw the daughters of men, that they were fair, and they took them wives of all which they chose, and the Lord said, my spirit shall not always strive with men, for that he also is flesh, yet his dad shall be on hundred and twenty years. There were giants in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of men came in, under the daughters of men, and their bear children to them, the same became mighty men, which were a old man of renown, and God saw that to the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually, and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man who might have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fouls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. The use of the generations of Noah, Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God, and Noah began to three sons, shem, ham, and jafeth. The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence, and God looked upon the earth and behold, it was corrupt. For all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth, and God said unto Noah, the end of all flesh is come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them, and behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make the an arc of coferwood, rooms shall tell make the arc, and shall tell pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is the fashion which thou shall make of it. The length of the actual be 300 cubits, the breadth of it, 50 cubits, and the height of it, 30 cubits. A window shall tell make to the arc, and him a cubit shall tell finish it above, and the door of the arc shall tell set in the side to their off, with lower second and third stories shall tell make it. And behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy off flesh, wherein is the breath of life from under heaven, and everything that is in the earth shall die. But with the thee, well I establish my covenant, and thou shall come into the arc, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons wives with thee. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shall tell bring into the arc to keep them alive with thee. They shall be male and female. Of fouls after their kind, and of castle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. And take that unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shall gather its to thee, and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. Thus did Noah, according to all that God commanded him, so did he. Chuck Resetten, and the Lord's Son to Noah, come valen all thy house into the arc, for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. Of every clean beast, thou shall take to thee, by seven, the male and his female, and of beasts that are not clean, by two, the male and his female. Of fouls also the air, by sevens, the male and the female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth, for yet seven days, and I will cause it to reign upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living substance that I have made while I destroy from off the face of the earth. And Noah did, according to all that the Lord commanded him, and Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth, and Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons lives with him into the arc, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean, and of fouls, and of everything that creepeth upon the earth, they went in two and two unto Noah into the arc, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. And it came to pass, after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the seventeenth day, where all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened, and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. In the self-same day, entered Noah and shem, and shem, and shepeth the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them into the arc. They and every beast after his kind, and all the castle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every foul after his kind, every bird of every sort, and they went in unto Noah into the arc, two and two of all flesh were in is the breath of life. And they that went in, went in male and female, of all flesh, as God had commanded him, and the Lord shut him in. And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased, and to bear up the arc, and it was lift up above the earth, and the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth, and the arc went upon the face of the waters, and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered. 15 qubits upwards did the waters prevail, and the mountains were covered, and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of a foul and of cattle and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man in all whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died, and every living substance was destroyed, which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and the creeping things, and the foul of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the arc, and Noah only remained alive, and they did that work with him in the arc, and the waters prevailed upon the earth on hundred and fifty days, chapter 8, and God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the arc, and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters was swaged. The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained, and the waters returned from off the earth continually, and after the end of the hundred and fifty days, the waters were abated, and the arc rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat, and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month, in the tenth month on the first day of the month, where the tops of the mountains seemed, and it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the arc which he had made, and he sent forth a raven, which went to and frown, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground, but if the dove found to no rest for the soul of the foot, and she returned unto him into the arc, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth, then he put forth his hand and took her, and to pull her in unto him into the arc, and he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the arc, and the dove came into him in the evening, and low, in her mouth was an onively plucked off, so no, I knew that the waters were abated from off the earth, and he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove, which returned not again unto him anymore, and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth, and Noah removed the covering of the arc, and locked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry, and in the second month, and the seven and twenty of day of the month was the earth dried, and God spicked to Noah's saying, go forth of the arc, thou and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons lives with him, playing fort with the every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of foul and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth, and Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons wives with him. Every beast, every creeping thing, and every foul, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the arc, and Noah preelted and altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean foul, and offered burnt offerings on the altar, and the Lord smelled a sweet savor, and the Lord said, in his heart, I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake, for the imagination of man's hagginess evil from his youth. Neither will I against my anymore, everything living, as I've done. While the earth remaineth, seed time and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. Chapter 9 And God blessed Noah and his sons and set unto them. Be fruitful and multiply and replenished the earth, and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every foul of the air, upon all that moveeth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea, into your hand very hard delivered. Every moving thing that a living shall be made for you, even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat. And surely your blood of your life is real I require. At the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. Who so-sheteth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God made he man. And you be ye fruitful and multiply, bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein, and God spank unto Noah and do his sons with him saying, and I behold I establish my covenant with you, and we go see it after you. And with every living creature that is with you of the foul of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you. Neither shall all flesh be cut off anymore by the waters of a flood. Neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And God said, this is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations. I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud of the earth. That's the bow shall be seen in the cloud. And I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the watershell no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto no one. This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. And the sons of Noah that went forth of the awkward, shem and ham, and jafith. And ham is the father of Cainan. The so the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole earth over spread. And Noah began to be in husband and he planted a vineyard. And he drank of the vine, and was struck in. And he was uncovered within his tent, and ham the father of Cainan saw the nakedness of his father. And told his two brethren without. And shem and jafith took a garment and laid its upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. And their fetus were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, cursed, became, and a servant of servant shall he be unto his brethren. And he said, blessed be the Lord God of shem, and Cainan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge jafith, and he shall dwell in the tents of shem, and Cainan shall be his servant. And Noah lived after the flood, 350 years. And all the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died. Chapter 10. Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah. Shem, ham, and jafith. And unto them were sons born after the flood. The sons of jafith, Gomer, and Magog, and to Mayday, and Javan, and to Bal, and to Mishak, and Tyrus. In the sons of Gomer, Ashkenaz, and Rifad, then to Tokarmah. And the sons of Javan, Alisha, and Tashish, Kittam, and to Dhodenim. By the use of the aisles of the Gentiles divided in their lands, everyone after his tongue after their families in their nations. In the sons of ham, Kush, and Missrium, and Fut, and Cainan. In the sons of Kush, Sibha, and Havala, and Saita, and Rama, and Saptaga. In the sons of Rama, Sibha, and Deden, and Kush, we got Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord, where half it is said, even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and to Erek, and to Akhad, and to Kownay, in the land of Shainar, out of that land, went forth ashore, and built in Nimra, and the city, Raabath, and Kaila. And to reason between Nimra and Kaila, the same as a great city. And Missrium, big atlead him, and a name him, and Lahibam, and enough to him, and pathrucing and caslur him, out of whom came for listing, and Kaftorn. And Cainan, we got Saita, his first born, and have, and the jep-y site, and the Amarite, and the Karkasite, and the Hiveite, and the Arkait, and the Sainite, and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Him-a-thite. And afterward, where the families of the Cainanites spread a broad, and the border of the Cainanites was from Saita, as they'll come as to do garara, unto Gasa, as they'll growest unto Saddam, and Kamara, and Aya-ma, and Sibon, even unto Lasha. These are the sons of ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. And to shim also, the father of all the children of Iber, the brother of Jafith, the elder, even to him, were children born. The children of shim, Elam and Asjore, and our faxid, and lured, and arum, and the children of arum, hooves, and hooal, and gather, and mash. And our faxid, Bikat, Selah, and Selah, Bikat, Iber, and unto Iber were born two sons. The name of one was Pileg, for in his days, was the earth divided. And his mother's name was Jachtin. And Jachtin, Bikat, Al-Modad, and Shilaf, and Hazarmaveth, and Jera, and Haddora, and Uzal, and Dittikla, and Obal, Upamail, and Shiba, and Ophir, and Havala, and Jobab, all the is with the sons of Jachtin. And their dwelling was from Amisha, as Laka was done to see far, amount of the east. The is of the sons of shim, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. These were the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations, and by these were the nations divided in the earth, after the flood. Jopt or leaven, and the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plane in the land of Shainah, and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, go, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly, and they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And they said, go to let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name, thus we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built it. And the Lord said, behold, the people is one, and they have all one language, and they say, begin to do, and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to let us go down and their confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from then upon the face of all the earth, and they left off to build the city. Their forest, the name of it's called Babel, because the Lord did there, confound the language of all the earth, and from then stood the Lord's scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. These are the generations of shem, shem was a hundred years old, and we got our faxed, two years after the flood, and shem laire after he we got our faxed, five hundred years, and we got to sons and daughters. And our faxed lived five into thirty years, and we got to say, la, and our faxed lived after he we got to say, la, four hundred and three years, and we got to sons and daughters, and say, la, and thirty years, and we got to heber, and say, la, they have to have dept, baby, and we got to not fall, and he where's its conclusion, and we asking, any health, without what they're saying, no of life, and their son. And Pileg lived after he began to write you 209 years and we got sons and daughters. And where you lived, 2030 years, and we got zero. And where you lived after he began to see Rook, 207 years, and we got sons and daughters. And zero lived 30 years and we got some may-hor. And so we lived after he began to nail her 200 years and we got sons and daughters. And they who lived 9 and 20 years and we got to Tera. And they who lived 9 and 20 years and we got Tera. And they who lived after he got Tera on 119 years and we got sons and daughters. And Tera lived 70 years and we got Abram, Nayhor and Taren. Now these are the generations of Tera. Tera, we got Abram, Nayhor and Taren. And Taren, we got Lot. And Taren died before his father, Tera, in the land of his nativity, in war of the Chaldees. And Abram meant Nayhor took them lives. The name of Abram's wife was Serae and the name of Nayhor's wife, Milka, the daughter of Haryn, the father of Milka and the father of Icecar. But Serae was Haryn, she had no child. And Tera took Abram his son and Lot, the son of Haryn, his sons son. And Serae, who's daughter and Lot, his son, Abram's wife. And they went forth with them from war of the Chaldees to go into the lands of Kainan. And they came unto Haryn and dwelt there. And the days of Tera were 205 years and Tera died in Haryn, chapter 12. Now, the Lord had said unto Abram, get the out of thy country and from thy Kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee. And I will make a fear great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great. And thou shall to be a blessing. And I will bless them but bless thee and curse him but curse it to thee. And in the shall all families of the earth be blessed. So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was 70 and five years old when he departed out of Haryn. And Abram took Serai his wife and Lot his brothers son and all their substance that he had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haryn. And they went forth to go into the land of Kainan. And into the land of Kainan became. And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sikam, unto the plain of Moray, and the Kainan night was then in the land. And the Lord appeared unto Abram and said, unto thy seed where I give this land, and there we'll get he and altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him. And he removed from pence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and bitched to stand, having Bethel on the west and hay I am east. And there he built it and altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord. And Abram turned it, going on still toward the south. And there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous in the land. And it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said, under Sarah his wife. Behold now, I know that's thou art of fair woman to look upon. Therefore, it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see thee. That's they shall say, this is his wife, and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and my social live because of thee. And it came to pass that when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. The prince is also of Pharaoh, saw her, and commanded her before Pharaoh, and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house, and he entrusted Abram well for her sake, and he had sheep and oxen, and he ases and men's servants and debates servants, and she ases and camels. And the Lord played Pharaoh, and his house with great plagues, because of Sarah, Abram's wife, and Pharaoh called Abram and said, what is this that thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? Why, saidst thou, she is my sister, so I might have taken her to me to wife. Now, therefore behold, to thy wife, take her and go thy way, and Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him, and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. Chapter 13 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and lot with him, entered the south. And Abram was very rich and cattle and silver and engulfed, and he went on his journeys from the south, even to Bethel, under the place where his tent had been, at the beginning, between Bethel and Haye, under the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first, and there, Abram called on the name of the Lord. And lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents. In the land was not able to bear them, but they might dwell together, for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. And there was a strife between the herd and of Abram's cattle, and the herd men of lots cattle, and the Cain and I, and the Parasite, to Weld, then in the land, and Abram sat unto Lot. That's there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen, for we be brethren, is not the whole land before thee. Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me, if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan. That it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord destroyed Sodam and Gomorrah. Even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, has thou come as done to Zawar. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed east, and they separated themselves to one from the other. Abram dwalled in the land of Cain and then Lot dwalled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent towards Sodam. But the men of Sodam were wicked, and sinners before the Lord, exceedingly. And the Lord sent unto Adam, after that Lot was separated from him. Lift up now thy eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward. For all the land which thou ceased to thee, while I give it, and to thy seed, for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. A rise, walk through the land in the length of it, and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee. Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of manry, which is in heaven, and built there an altar unto the Lord. And it came to pass in the days of Amrafel King of Shainar, Ariyak King of Alaisar, Kedale-Omer, King of Elam, and Taidal King of Nations, that thee he's made more with Barra, King of Sodam and with Bursha, King of Gomorrah, Shainab, King of Agma, and Shemab, King of Sabawim, and the King of Baila, which is Zawar. All these were joined together in the veil of Sidim, which is the Salt Sea. Twelve years they served Kedale-Omer, and in the 13th year they rebound, and in the 14th year came Kedale-Omer, and the kings that were with him, and smoked the Reffeyams in Asturath-Karnayam, and the Susams in Ham, and the Eamams in Shavakariatham, and the Horites in their Mount Seer, and to El Paran, which is by the wilderness, and they returned at came to Amnishpat, which is Kedale-Omer, and smoked all the country of the Amalachites, and also the Amarites that Welch and Hazards on Tamar. And they went out the King of Sodom, and the King of Gomorrah, and the King of Atma, and the King of Sabawim, and the King of Baila, the same as Zawar, and they joined battle with them in the veil of Sidim, with Kedale-Omer, the King of Elam, and with Tidal, King of Nations, and Amr-Fel, King of Sinah, and Ariak, King of Elasar, four kings with five, and the veil of Sidim was full of slime pits, and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and Fel there, and they that remained fled to the mountain. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their rituals, and went their way. And they took a lot, Abrams brothers son, Ud-Weltan son, and his goods, and departed. And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt in the plain of Man-ray, the Amarite, brother of Eschko, the brother of Amar, and these were confederate with Abram. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them on Jodan, and he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smoked them, and pursued them on Jodobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. Then he brought back all the goods, and also brought again, his brother, Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. And the King of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Kedeleoma, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shava, which is the King's Dayal. And Mel Kedeleck, King of Salem, brought forth Brad and wine, and he was the priest of the most high god, and he blessed him and said, blessed be Abram of the most high god, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be the most high god, which have delivered divine enemies into thy hand, and he gave him tithe of all, and the king of Sodom sent unto Abram, give me the persons and take the goods to thy self, and Abram sent to the king of Sodom. I've lift up my hand unto the Lord, the most high god, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take from a thread, even to a shoe latch it, and that I will not take anything that is thine. Last thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich. Save only that which the young man have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, and are asch called and memory, but them take their portions.

The 64-Square Madhouse,Fritz Leiber,83334,3.0,"February 14, 2020",[],0,"vox.org. Recording by Phil Shenevere, Beton Rouge, Louisiana. This story was first published in World of Ith Science Fiction, May 1962. The 64 Square Madhouse by Fritz Slyber. Part 1. Silently so is not to shock anyone with illusions about well-dressed young women. Sandra Lee Grilling, cursed the day she had persuaded the Chicago Space Mirror that there would be all sorts of human interstories to be picked up at the first international Grand Master Chest Tournament in which an electronic computing machine was entered. Not that there weren't enough humans around, it was the interest that was endowed. The large hall was crammed with energetic, dark-suited men of whom a disproportionately large number were bald, war glasses were fatally untidy and indefinitely shabby, had slavic or skinned an avian features and talked foreign languages. They act inturmatively. The only ones who didn't were scurrying individuals with the eager zombie look of officials. Chest sets were everywhere, big ones on tables, still bigger, diagram-type electric ones on walls, small peck-in sets dragged from side pockets and manipulate a rapidly S part of the conversational ritual and still smaller folding sets in which the pieces were the tiny magnetized discs used for playing in freefall. There were signs featuring largely mysterious combinations of letters. If IDE, WBM, USCF, USCF, USCR and UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly sure about the last three. The mini clocks, bedside table size, would have struck a familiar note except that they had little red flags and wheels sprinkled over their faces and they were all in pairs, two clocks to a case. That sign-meast-twent clocks should be essential to a chest tournament, struck Sandra as a particularly mad-ninks-archum stance. Her last assignment had been to interview the pilot pair writing the first American manned Chercom Luna satellite and the five alternate pairs who hadn't made the flight. This tournament hall seemed to Sandra much further out of the world. Overhodes scraps of conversation, it reasonably intelligible English were not particularly helpful. Samples? They say the machine has been programmed to play nothing but pure barzac system and Indian defenses and the dragon formation if anyone pushes the king pawn. Ah, in that case, the Russians have come with ten trunk fools of prepared variations and they'll gang up on the machine at adjournments, while can one New Jersey computer do a kids four Russian grandmasters? I heard the Russians have been programmed with hypnotic cramming and some no breathing, but been it at a nervous breakdown? Why the machine hasn't even a hop-turnier or an intercollision one? It'll over its head be playing. Yes, but maybe like Kappa at Sensobastion or Morphe or Willy Angler at New York, the Russians will look like putters. Have you studied the scores of the match between Moonbase and Chercom Terra? That worth the trouble, the play was feeble, barely expert rating. Sandra's chief difficulty was that she knew absolutely nothing about the game of chess. A point that she had slid over and conferring with the powers of the space mirror, but that now had begun to weigh on her. How wonderful it would be, she dreamed, to walk out this minute, find a quiet bar and get pie-eyed in an evil ladylike way. Perhaps Madame Azel would like a drink. Here, darned, tuton she would, Sandra replied in a rush, and then looked down apprehensively at the person who had read her thoughts. It was a small, sprightly elderly man who looked like a somewhat thinned down Peter Lori. There was that same impression of the happy, slavic elf. That was left of his white hair was cut very short, making a silver-renepp. His pinceners had quite thick lenses. But in sharp contrast to the somberly clad men around him, he was wearing a pearl-grace suit of almost exactly the same shade as Sandra's. A circumstance that created for her, the illusion that they were fellow conspirators. Hey, wait a minute, she protested just the same. He had already taken her arm and was piloting her to or the nearest flight of low-wired stairs. How did you know I wanted a drink? I could see that Madame Azel was having difficulty swallowing. He replied, keeping them moving. Pardon me for feasting my eyes on your lovely throat. I didn't suppose they'd served drinks here. In put of course, they were already mounting the stairs. What would just be without coffee or schnops? Okay, lean on, Sandra said, you're the doctor. Doctor? He smiled widely. You know I like being called that. Then the name is yours as long as you want it to duck. Meanwhile the happy little man was edging them into the first of a small cluster of tables, where a dog suited jabbering trio was just rising. He snapped his fingers and hissed through his teeth. A white-happened waiter materialized. For myself, black coffee, he said, for Madame Azel, Ryan wine and sulther, that it will find, Sandra leaned back. Confidentially, Doc, I was having trouble swallowing. Well, just about everything here. He nodded. You were not the first to be shocked and horrified by chess. He assured her. It is a curse of the intellect. It is a game for lunatics or else they create them. But what brings a sane and beautiful young lady to this 64 square madhouse? Sandra briefly told him her story and her predicament. By the time they were served, Doc had absorbed the one and assessed the other. You have one great advantage, he told her. You'll know nothing whatsoever of chess, so you will be able to write about it understandably for your readers. He swallowed half his dimmy toss and spacked his lips. As for the machine, you do know, I suppose, that it is not a humanoid metal robot walking about clanking and squeaking like a late medieval light in armor. Yes, Doc, but Sandra found difficulty in phrasing the question, wait, he lifted a finger. I think I know what you're going to ask. You want to know why if the machine works at all, it doesn't work perfectly, so that it always wins and then there is no contest. Right? Sandra Grindanotted. The ability to interpret her mind was as comforting as the bubbly, mildly astringent mixture she was sipping. He removed his pinsnets, besides the bridge of his nose and replaced them. If you had, he said, a billion computers all as fast as the machine. It would take them all the time, there ever will be in the universe just to play through all the possible games of chess, not to mention the time needed to classify those games into branching families of wins for white wins for black and draws, and the additional time required to trace out the chains of key moves leading all ways to wins. So the machine can't play chess like God. What the machine can do is examine all the likely lines of play for about eight moves ahead, that is four moves each for white and black, and then decide which is the best move on the basis of capturing enemy pieces, working toward a checkmate, establishing a powerful central position and so on. That sounds like the way a man would play a game, Sandra observed, look ahead a little way and try to make a plan. You know, like getting out Trump's in bridge or setting up a finesse, exactly. Doc Beamed at her approvingly. The machine is like a man. A rather peculiar and not exactly pleasant man. A man who always abides by sound principles, who is utterly incapable of flights of genius, but who never makes a mistake. You see, you are finding human interest already, even in the machine. Sandra nodded. Does a human chess player, a grandmaster, I mean, ever look eight moves ahead in a game? Most assuredly he does. Inclusual situations say where there's a chance of winning at once by trapping the enemy king. The examines many more moves ahead than that, thirty or forty even. The machine is probably programmed to recognize such situations and do something of the same sort. Though we can't be sure from the information, world business machines has released. But in most chess positions, the possibilities are so very nearly unlimited that even a grandmaster can only look a very few moves ahead and must rely on his judgment to and experience and artistry. The equivalent of those in the machine is the directions fed into it before it plays a game. You mean the programming? Indeed, yes. The programming is the crux of the problem of the chess playing computer. The first practical model reported by Bernstein and Roberts of IBM in 1958, and which looked for moves ahead was programmed so that it had a greedy, worried tendency to grab it in any pieces and to retreat its own whenever they were attacked. It had a personality like that of a certain kind of chess playing dub. A dull brain would push her afraid to take the slightest risk of losing material, but a dub who could almost always beat an utter novice. The WBM machine here in the hall operates about a million times as fast. Don't ask me how I'm no physicist, but it depends on the new transistors and something they call hypervolosity, which in turn depends on keeping part of the machine at a temperature near absolute zero. However the result is that the machine can see eight moves ahead and is capable of being programmed much more craftily. A million times as fast as the first machine you say doc and yet it only sees twice as many moves ahead. Sandra objected. There is a geometrical progression involved there. He told her with a smile. Believe me, eight moves ahead is a lot of moves when you remember that the machine is erlessly examining every one of thousands of variations. Flesh and blood chess masters have lost games by blunderers they could have avoided by looking only one or two moves ahead. The machine will make no such overcites. Once again you see you have the human factor in this case working for the machine. So, really I have been looking all place for you. A stocky, both-faced man with a great brisseling shock of black, gray-flicked hair had halted abruptly by their table. He bet over doc and began to whisper explosively in a gutterl foreign tongue. And was gazed, traveled beyond the bellestrade. Now that she could look down at it, the central hall seemed less confusedly crowded. In the middle to where the far end were five small tables spaced rather widely apart, and with a chess board and minute one of the Siamese clocks set out on each. To either side of the hall were tears of temporary seats about half of them occupied. There were at least as many more people still wondering about. On the far wall was a big electric scoreboard and also above the corresponding tables, five large, dullly glassy chessboards, the white squares in light gray, the black squares in dark. One of the five wall chess boards was considerably larger than the other four, the one above the machine. And were looked with quickening interest at the console of the machine. A bank of keys and some half dozen panels of rows and rows of tiny telltale lights all dark at the moment. A thick red velvet cord on little brass standards ran around the machine at a distance of about 10 feet. Inside the cord were only a few gray-smocked men. Two of them had just laid a black cable to the nearest chess table and were attaching it to the Siamese clock. Sandra tried to think of a being who always checked everything, but only within limits beyond which his thoughts never ventured and who never made a mistake. Miss Grilling may I present to you Igor Jondorf. She turned back quickly with a smile and a nod. I should tell you Igor, Doc continued, that Miss Grilling represents a large and influential bit western newspaper, perhaps you have a message for her readers. The shock-headed man's eyes flashed. I most certainly do. At that moment, the waiter arrived with a second coffee and wine and seltzer. And off seized Doc's new limit, drained it, set it back on the tray with a flourish and drew himself up. Tell your readers Miss Grilling. He proclaimed firstly arching his eyebrows at her and actually slapping his chest. That I, Igor Jondorf, will defeat the machine by the living force of my human personality. Already I have offered to play it an informal game blind folded. I'll play fifty blind full games simultaneously. It's almost refused me. I have challenged it also to a few games of rapid transit and offer no true Grandmaster would Derek nor. Again, they refuse me. I predict that the machine will play like a great off, at least again to me. Repeat, I, Igor Jondorf by the living force of my human personality will defeat the machine. Do you have that? You can remember it? Oh, yes, Sandru, assure him. But there are some other questions I want very much to ask you, Mr. Jandorf. I am sorry, Miss Grilling, but I must clear my mind now. In ten minutes they started the clocks. While Sandru arranged for an interview with Jandorf after the day is playing session, Doc reordered his coffee. One expected of Jandorf, he explained to Sandru with a philosophical shrug when the shock headed man was gone. At least he didn't take your wine and seltzer or did he? One tip I have for you, don't call a chess master, Mr. Call him master. They eat it up. Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you for everything. I hope I haven't offended Miss Grilling, so that he doesn't. Don't worry about that. While horses couldn't keep Jandorf away from my present review, you know his rapid transit challenge was cunning. That's a minor variety of chess where each player gets only ten seconds to make a move. Which I don't suppose would give the machine time to look three moves ahead? chess players would say that the machine has a very slow sight of the board. This tournament is being played if the usual international rate of fifteen moves an hour, and is that why they've got all those crazy clocks? Sandra interrupted? Oh yes, chess clocks measure the time each player takes and making his moves. When a player makes a move, he presses a button that shuts his clock off and turns the opponents on. If a player uses too much time, he loses as surely as if he were checkmated. Now since the machine will almost certainly be programmed to take an equal amount of time on successive moves, a rate of fifteen moves an hour means it will have a four minutes they move, and it will need every second of them. It's a Italy. It was typical Jandorf provado to make a point of a blind-folded challenge. Just as if the machine weren't playing blind-folded itself, or is the machine blind-folded? How do you think of it? Gosh, I don't know. Say, Doc, is it really true that Master Jandorf has played fifty games at once blind-folded? I can't believe that. Of course not. Doc a shirter? It was only 49 and he lost two of those in Drew five. And of all ways exaggerates. It's in his blood. He's one of the Russian's, isn't he? Sandra asked, Igor? Doc chuckled. Not exactly. He said gently. He is originally a pole, and now he has Argentine and citizenship. You have a program, don't you? Sandra started to hunt through her pocketbook, but just then two list of names lit up on the Big Electric Scoreboard.

"The B. B. Warfield Collection, Volume 1",Benjamin B. Warfield,50273,,"December 29, 2020",[],0,"it Libravox.org. Dr John Bascom has lately told us a fresh and certainly as we shall all agree most truly that the relation of the natural and supernatural is the question of questions which underlies our rational life. The fact of such a relation he justly adds is the most patent and omnipresent in the history of the human mind. We cannot think at all without facing the great problems which arise out of the perennial pressure of this most persistent of intellectual questions. From the first dawn of intelligence each human mind has busyed itself instinctively with their adjustment. The history of human thought in every race from its earliest beginnings is chiefly concerned with the varying relations which men in this or that stage of culture or under the influence of this or that dominating conception have conceived to exist between the natural world in which they lived and that supernatural world which they have ever been prone to conceive to lie above and beyond it. The most elaborate systems are philosophy differing nothing in this respect from the tentative efforts of un tutored thinking. For them too the problem of the supernatural is the prime theme of their investigation and the solutions which have commended themselves to them. Two have been the most varied possible running through the entire series from the one-sided assertion of the natural as absolute and complete with the exclusion of all supernaturalism. To the equally one-sided affirmation of the reality of the supernatural alone with the entire exclusion of all that can probably be called natural. Between these two extremes of atheistic naturalism and superstitious supernaturalism nearly every possible adjustment of the relation of the two factors has found some advocates so that there is some colour to Dr. Bascom's plain to that though the proper appreciation of their relation constitutes the summation of sound philosophy its final conception and statement eludes all. Some colour but not a thorough justification. For amid all the variety and confusion of men's ideas on this great subject there are not lacking certain lines of direction leading to one assured goal broadly outlined only it may be and seen only dimly through the mist of innumerable errors of detail within which it is demonstrable that the aonian thinking of the race is always travelling. Within which also it is clear that the best and most vital of that high conscious thinking which we call philosophy finds the limits of its conceptions and the pathway of its advance. We may not fancy that every conceivable conception of the relation of the natural and supernatural has found equal favour in the unsophisticated mind of men or has one equal support from the criticised elaborations of philosophical contemplation. No one who will permit to pass before his mental vision the long procession of world conceptions which have dominated the human race in its several stages of development will imagine that humanity at large has ever been tempted to doubt much less to deny the reality or the significance to it of either the natural or the supernatural. On any adequate survey of the imminent thought of the world as expressed in its systems of popular belief atheistic naturalism and exclusive supernaturalism exhibit themselves as a like in human. Atheists have existed who knew and would know nothing beyond what their five senses immediately gave them and naturalistic atheism has found expression in elaborate systems which have walked the conceptions of large masses of men and in like manner a debased superstition has fallen like a pool over entire communities and for ages has darkened their minds and cursed their whole life. So they have from time to time appeared among men both ascetic solid trees and communistic socialists though God has set mankind in families. The band of camp followers on either wing of an army confuses no man's judgment as to the whereabouts of the army itself but rather points directly to its position. Similarly a general consideration of the great philosophical systems of the world will leave us in no doubt as to the trend of deliberate pondering upon this subject. Somewhere between the two extremes of a consistent naturalism and an exclusive supernaturalism we shall assure the finer center of gravity of their thinking of the ages. The point on which philosophy rests all the more stably that on both sides wings stretch themselves far beyond all support and hang over the abyss. Precisely where between the two extremes this stable center is to be found it may be more difficult to determine our instruments of measurement and not always implements of precision. Assurably however it will not be found where either the purely supernatural or the purely natural is excluded and in any case it is much to know that it lies somewhere between the two extremes and that it is as unfulisophical as it is inhuman to deny or doubt either the natural or the supernatural. It is not to be gain-said of course that from time to time strong tendencies of thought set in to this direction or to that and for a while it may seem as if the whole world were rushing to one extreme or the other. A special type of philosophizing becomes temporarily dominant and its conceptions run burning over the whole thinking world. At such times men are likely to fancy that the great problem of the ages is settled and to felicitate themselves upon the facility with which they see through what to men of other times were clouds of great darkness. Such a period visited European thought in the last century where English daism set the supernatural so far off from the world that French atheism thought it an easy thing to dispense with it altogether. Down with the infamy cried Voltaire and actually thought the world had harkened to his commandment. The atheistic naturalism of the 18th century has long since taken up its abode with the owls and bats but the world has not yet learned its lesson. And even more powerful current seems to have seized the modern world and to be hurling it by a very different pathway to practically the same conclusion. It is to be feared that it cannot be denied that we are today in the midst of a very strong drift away from Frank recognition of the supernatural as a factor in human life. To this also Dr. Bascom may be cited as a witness, the task which the bolder thinking about time has undertaken he tells us is to curb the supernatural to bring it into the full service of reason. To curb the supernatural, yes that is the labour with which the thinkers of our day have burdened themselves. The taproot of this movement is firmly set in a pantheistic philosophy to which of course there is no such distinction possible as that between the natural and supernatural. To it all things are natural, the necessary product of the blind interaction of the forces inherent in what we call matter but which the pantheist calls God and thinks he has thereby given not only due but even sole recognition to the supernatural. But it has reached out and embraced in its ramified network of branches the whole sphere of human thinking through the magic watchword of evolution by means of which it strives to break down and obliterate all the lines of demarcation which separate things that differ and thus to reduce all that exists to but varying forms taken through natural processes by the one life that underlies them all. How absolutely determined the conception of evolution has become in the thinking of our age there can be no need to remind ourselves. It may not be a miss however to recall the anti-supernaturalistic root and the anti-supernaturalistic effects of the dominance of this mode of conceiving things and thus to identify in it the cause of the persistent anti-supernaturalism which at present characterizes the world's thought. The recognition of the supernatural is too deeply entrenched in human nature ever to be extopated. Man is not a brute and he differs from the roots in nothing more markedly or more in erratically than in his correlation with an unseen world. But probably there never was an era in which the thinking of the more or less educated classes was more deeply tinged with an anti-supernatural stain than at present. Even when we confess the supernatural with our lips and look for it and find it with our reasons, our instincts as modern men lead us unconsciously to neglect and in all practical ways to disallow and even discouper it. It would be impossible that what we call specifically Christian thought should be unaffected by such a powerful trend in the thinking of the world. Christian men are men first and Christians afterwards and therefore their Christian thinking is super induced on a basis of world thinking. Theology accordingly in each age is stamped with the traits of the philosophy ruling at the time. The supernatural is the very breath of Christianity's nostrils and an anti-supernaturalistic atmosphere is to it the deadliest may asma. An absolutely anti-supernaturalistic Christianity is therefore a contradiction in terms. Nevertheless, immersed in an anti-supernaturalistic world atmosphere, Christian thinking tends to become as anti-supernaturalistic as is possible to it. And it is indisputable that this is the characteristic of the Christian thought of our day. As Dr. Baskamp puts at the task that has been set themselves by those who would fame be considered the bolder thinkers of our time is to curb the supernatural, to bring it into the full service of reason. The real question with them seems to be not what kind and measure of supernaturalism does the Christianity of Christ and his apostles recognise and require, but how little of the supernatural may be admitted and yet men continue to call themselves Christians. The effort is not to Christianise the world conception of the age, but specifically to de-supernaturalise Christianity so as to bring it into a chord with a prevailing world view. The effects of the adoption of this point of view are all about us. This is the account to give for example of that speculative theism which poses under the name of non-morecular Christianity through reasoners like Flaiderer and to woo it through novels like Robert Elsemier. This is also the account to give of that odd, positiveistic religion offered us by the followers of Iberate Ritsch who under color of a phenomenalism which knows nothing of the thing in itself, profess to hold it not to be a matter of serious importance to Christianity whether God be a person or Christ be God or the soul have any persistence and to find it enough to bask in the sweet impression which is made on the heart by the personality of the man Jesus, dimly seen through the myths of critical history. This is the account again to give of the growing disbelief and denial of the virgin birth of our Lord, of the increasingly numerous and subtle attempts to explain away his bodily resurrection and in far wider circles of the ever renewed and constantly varying efforts that positively swarm about us to reduce his miracles and those of his predecessors and followers, the God endowed prophets and apostles of the two testaments to natural phenomena, the product of natural forces, though these forces may be held to be as yet undiscovered or even entirely undiscoverable by men. This also is the account to give of the Vogue which destructive criticism of the biblical books has gained in our time and it is also the reason why detailed refutations of the numerous critical theories of the origin of biblical writings, though so repeatedly complete and logically final have so little effect in abolishing destructive criticism. It's roots are not set in its detailed accounts of the origin of the biblical writings but in its anti-supernatralistic bias and so long as it's two fixed points remain to it. It's starting point in unbelief in the supernatural and its goal in a naturalistic development of the religion of Israel and its record. It easily shifts the pathway by which it proceeds from one to the other, according to its varying needs. It is of as little moment to it, how it passes from one point to the other, as it is to the electrician what course is why I shall follow after he has secured its end attachments. Therefore theory follows theory with bewildering rapidity and shall we not say it with equally bewildering levity, while the conclusion remains the same. And finally, this is the account to give of the endlessly varying schemes of self-salvation offered the world in our day and of the practical neglect and not in frequent open denial of the personal work of the Holy Spirit on the heart. In every way, in a word and in every sphere of Christian thought, the Christian thinking of our time is curbed, limited confined within unnatural bounds by doubt and hesitation before the supernatural. In wide circles, the reality of direct supernatural activity in this world is openly rejected. In wider circles still, it is doubted, almost everywhere its assertion is timid and chariom. It is significant of much that one of the brightest of recent Christian apologists has found necessary to prefix to his treatment of Christian supernaturalism, a section on the evasion of the supernatural among Christian thinkers. It is certainly to be allowed that it is no like task for a Christian man to hold his anchorage in the rush of such a current anti-supernatalistic thought. We need not wonder that so many are carried from their mornings. How shall we so firmly brace ourselves that as the flood of the world's thought beats upon us, it may bring us cleansing and refreshment, but may not sweep us away from our grasp on Christian truth. How but by constantly reminding ourselves of what Christianity is and of what, as Christian men, who must need belief as to the nature and measure of the supernatural in its impact on the life of the world. For this nature and measure of the supernatural, we have all the evidence which gives us Christianity. And surely the mass of that evidence is far too great to be shaken by any current of the world's thought whatever. Christian truth is a rock to securely planted to go down before any storm. Let us attach ourselves to it by such strong cables and let us know so well its geometries of vantage and secure hiding places that though the waters may go over us, we shall not be moved. To this end, it will not be useless to recall continually the frankness of Christianity's commitment to the absolute supernatural. And it may be that we shall find profit in enumerating at this time a few of the points at least at which as Christian men, we must recognise with all heartiness, the intrusion of pure supernaturalism into our conception of things. One. The Christian man then must first of all give the heartiest and frankest recognition to the supernatural fact. God we call it, but it is not enough for us to say God. The pantheist too says God and means this universal frame. For him accordingly the supernatural is but the more inclusive natural. When the Christian says God he means, and if he is to remain Christian he must mean a supernatural God, a God who is not entangled in nature, is not only another name for nature in its coordinated activities, or for that mystery which lies beneath and throbs through the all, but who is above nature and beyond, who existed the living God before nature was, and should nature cease to be would still exist the everlasting God. And so long as this universal frame in dearest exists above and outside of nature as its Lord, its Lord give up and its Almighty King. No Christian man may allow that the universe, material and spiritual combined, call it infinite if you will in all its operations, be they as myriad as you choose, sums up the being or the activities of God. Before this universe was, God was the one eternal one, rich in infinite activities and while this universe persists outside and beyond and above it, God is the one infinite one, in effortably rich in innumerable activities inconceivable. It may be to the whole universe of derived being. He is not imprisoned within his works, the laws, which he has ordained for them express indeed his character, but do not compass the possibilities of his action. The Apostle Paul has no doubt told us that in him we live and move and have our being, but no accredited voice has declared that in the universe he lives and moves and has his being. No, the heaven of heavens cannot contain him and what he has made is to what he is, only as the smallest, moist, aparticle of the most attenuated vapor to the mighty expanse of the immeasurable sea. The divine imonence is a fact to the Christian man, but to the Christian man this fact of the divine imonence is not the ultimate expression of his conception of God. Its recognition does not operate for him as a limitation of God in being or activities. It does not result in enclosing him within his works and confining the possibilities of his action to the capacities of their laws. It is rather the expression of the Christians sense of a comparative littleness of the universe, to every part and activity of which God is present, because the whole universe is to him as the musted sea lying in the palm of a man. An imminent God, yes, but what is his imonence in even this immense universe to a guard like ours? God in nature, yes, but what is God in nature to the inconceivable vastness of the God above nature? To the Christian conception so far is the imminent God from exhausting the idea of God that it touches but the skirt of his garment. It is only when we rise above the divine imonence to catch some faint glimpse of the guard that transcends all the works of his hands to the truly supernatural God that we begin to know who and what the Christian God is. Let us say then with all the emphasis that we are capable of, that the Christians God is before all else the transcendent God, a God so great that though he be truly the supporter of this whole universe as well as its maker. Yet his activity as ground of existence and governor of all that moves is as nothing to that greater activity which is his apart from and above what is to us the infinite universe but to him and infinitesimal speck of being that cannot in any way control his life. The Christians God is no doubt the God of nature and the God in nature, but before and above all this, he is the God above nature the supernatural fact. As Christian men we must see to it that we retain a worthy conception of God and an exclusively imminent God is after all a very little and belittling notion to hold of him the product of who's simple word all this universe is. To the Christian man again must need most frankly and heartily believe in the supernatural act. Belief in the supernatural act is indeed necessarily included in belief in the supernatural fact. If immanence is an inadequate formula for the being of God it is equally inadequate as a formula for his activities. For where God is there he must act and if he exists above and beyond nature he must act also above and beyond nature. The supernatural God cannot but be conceived as a supernatural actor. He who called nature into being by a word cannot possibly be subject to the creature of his will in the mode of his activities. He to whom all nature is but a spec of derived and dependent being cannot be thought of as in the reach of his operations bound within the limits of the laws which operate within this granular and hold it together. Before all that we call nature came into existence God was in infinite fullness of life and of the innumerable activities which infinite fullness of life implies and that nature has come into existence is due to an act of his pre-natural power. Nature in other words has not come into existence at all it has been made. And if it was made it must have been a supernatural act. The Christian conception of creation involves thus the frankest recognition of the supernatural act. To the Christian man nature cannot be conceived either as self-existent or as self-made or as a necessary emanation from the basal being which we call God. Nor yet as a mere modification in form of the one eternal substance. It is a manufactured article the product of an act of power, God spoke and it was and the God that thus spoke nature into being is necessarily a supernatural god creating nature by a supernatural act. As Christian men we must at all hazards preserve this supernaturalistic conception of creation. There are voices strong and subtle which would woo us from it. One would have us believe that in what we call creation God did but give form and law to a dark somewhat which from all eternity labor side him, chaining thus by his almighty power the realm of inimical matter to the divine chariot wheels of order and progress. Or if that crest dualism seems to gross the outlying realm of darkness is subtly spoken of as the nothing. The power it exerts is affirmed to be simply a dull and inert resistance while yet the character of the product of God's creative power is represented as conditioned by the nothing out of which it is made. Another would have us believe that what we call nature is of the substance of God himself and what we call creation is about the modification of form and manifestation which takes place in the eternal sistol and die a stall of the divine life. Or if this crass pantheism seems to gross a subtle ontology is called in matter is resolved into its atoms the atoms are conceived as mere centers of force and this force is asserted to be the pure will of God so that after all no substance exists except the substance of God. As over against all such speculations gross and subtle alike the Christian man is bound to maintain that God created the heavens and the earth that this great act by which he called into being all that is was in the strictest sense of the words a creation and that in this act of creation he produced in the strictest sense of the words a somewhat. It was an act of creation not a mere molding or ordering of a pre-existent substance not a mere evolution or modification of his own substance and in it he produced a somewhat not a mere appearance or a similar cram but being derived and dependent being but just as real being as his own infinite essence in creation therefore the Christian man is bound to confess a frankly supernatural act an act above nature independent of nature by which nature itself and all its laws were brought into existence. Nor can he confine himself to the confession of this one supernatural act the Christians God not only existed before nature and is its creator but also exists above nature and is its governor and lord it is inconceivable that he should be active only in that spec of being which he himself has called into existence by an act of his independent power. It exists in him not he in it and just because it is finite and he is infinite the great sphere of his life and activity lies above it and beyond. It is equally inconceivable that his activities with reference to it or even within it should be confined to the operation of the laws which he has ordained for the regulation of its activities and not of his. What power has this little spec of derived being to exclude the operation upon it and within it of that almighty force to whose energy it owes both its existence and its persistence in being. Have its forces acquired such strength as to neutralise the power which called it into being or has it framed for itself a crust so hard as to isolate it from the omnipotence which plays about it and successfully to resist the power that made it that it may not crush it or pierce it and will through and through. Certainly he who confesses the Christians God has no ground for denying the supernatural act. Now nothing is further from the Christians thought then to doubt the reality and efficiency of second causes just because he believes that in creation God created a somewhat real substance in doubt with real powers. He believes that these powers really act and really produce their effects. He thinks of nothing so little to be sure as to doubt the immanence of God in these second causes. It is his joy to see the hand of God in all that occurs and to believe that it is not only by his preserving care but in accordance with his direction that every derived cause acts and every effect is produced. But least of all men has the Christian a desire to substitute the immediate energy of God for his immediate activity in his ordinary government of the universe which he has made. Just because he believes that the universe was well made, he believes that the forces with which it was in doubt are competent for its ordinary government and he traces it in their action, the divine purpose unrolling its fulceless scroll. The Christian man then is frankly ready to accredited to second causes all that second causes are capable of producing. He is free to trace them in all the products of time and to lend his ear to the poets when they tell him that this solid earth where on we tread, in tracks of fluent heat began and grew to seeming random forms the seeming prey of cyclic storms till at the last arose the man. He only insists that in all this great process by which he is told the ordered world was hacked and heun out by the great forces and convulsions of nature we shall perceive also with the poets that those great artificers hack and hue were the sons of God and stood one at his right hand and one at his left to obey as he taught them how. Let us open our eyes wide to the grandeur and perfection of God's providential government and let us not neglect to note that he or two is a supernaturalism and that in the ordered progress of the world towards that one far off divine event we can trace the very finger of God. But let us not fancy on the other hand that the providence of God any more than the immanence of God is a formula adequate to sum up all his activities. God is the God of Providence but he is much more than the God of Providence. The universe is but a spec in his sight and its providential government is scarcely an incident in the infinite fullness of his life. It is certain that he acts in infinitely varied modes otherwise and beyond providence and there is no reason we can give why he should not act otherwise and beyond providence even in relation to the universe which he has made. In our conception of a supernatural God we dare not erect his providential activity into an exclusive law of action for him and refuse to allow of any other mode of operation. Who can say for example whether creation itself in the purity and absoluteness of that conception may not be progressive and may not correlate itself with and follow the process of the providential development of the world in the plan of such a God so that the works of creation and providence may interlace through all time in the production of this completed universe. What warrant then can there be to assume beforehand that some way must be found for evolution to spring the chasms in the creative process over which even divinely led second causes appear insufficient to build a bridge. And if for any reason certainly not unforeseen by God or in contradiction to his ordering there should a rift appear in the loot who dare assert that the supernatural God may not directly intervene for its minding but must need's beat out his music on the broken strings or let their discord jar down the ages to all eternity. The laws of nature are not bonds by which God is tied so that he cannot move save within their limits and they are not in his sight such great and holy things that it would be sacrilege for him not to honor them in all his activities. His real life is above and beyond them. There is no reason why he may not at will act independently of them even in dealing with nature itself and if there be reason why he should act apart from them we may be sure that the supernatural God will so act the frank recognition of the possibility of the supernatural act and of its probable reality on adequate occasion is in any event a part of the Christian man's heritage. 3. And this leads us to recognise next that the Christian man must cherish a frank and hearty faith in a supernatural redemption as certainly as the recognition of the great fact of sin is an element in the Christian's world conception. The need and therefore the actuality of the direct, corrective act of God, of miracles in a word enters in erratically into his belief. We cannot confess ourselves sinners radically at breach with God and broken and deformed in our moral and spiritual being and look to purely natural causes or to simply providential agencies which act only through natural causes and therefore never beyond their reach for our recovery to God and to moral and spiritual health. And in proportion as we realise what sin is what in the Christian conception is the nature of that bottomless gulf which it has opened between the sinning soul and the old holy and fultelessly just God. The single source of the soul's life and what is the consequent moral character of the wound which sin has inflicted on the soul. In that proportion will it become more and more plain to us that there is no ability in what we fondly call the remedial forces of nature, no capacity in growth however skillfully led by even an all-wise providence to heal this hurt. A seed of life may indeed be developed into a bounding life but no wise leading can direct a seed of death into the ways of life. Did things do not climb? As well expect dead and decaying Lazarus through the action of natural forces, however wisely directed to put on the fresh firmness of youthful flesh and stand forth a sound and living man as a soul dead in sin to rise by natural powers into newness of life. Know the world knows that dead men do not live again and the world's singers on the plain of nature rightly declare one thing is certain and the rest is lies the flower that once has blown forever dies. If no supernatural voice had cried at the door of Lazarus's tomb Lazarus come forth it would have been true of him too what the rebellious poet shouts in the ears of the rest of men once dead you shall never return and if there be no voice of supernatural power to call dead souls back unto life those who are dead in sin must need fester in their corruption to the eternity of eternities. One might suppose the supernaturalness of redemption to be too obviously the very heart of the whole Christian system and to constitute to fundamentally the very essence of the Christian proclamation for it to be possible for anyone claiming the Christian name to lose sight of it for a moment. assuredly the note of the whole history of redemption is the supernatural. To see this we do not need to focus our eyes on the supernatural man who came to redeem sinners the man from heaven as Paul calls him who was indeed of the seed of David according to the flesh but at the same time was guard over all blessed forever and became thus poor only that by his poverty we might become rich. The word who was in the beginning with guard and was guard as John calls him who became flesh and dwelt among men exhibiting to their astonished eyes the glory of an only begotten of the father. The scent of the father whom to have seen was to see the father also as he himself witnessed who is before Abraham was and while on earth a bide still in heaven who came to earth by an obviously supernatural pathway breaking his way through a virgin's womb and lived on earth and obviously supernatural life with the forces of nature and powers of disease and death subject to his simple word and left the earth in an obviously supernatural ascension after having burst the bonds of the grave and lead captivity captive. The whole course of preparation for his coming, extending through centuries is just as clearly a supernatural history, sewn with miracle and prophecy and itself the greatest miracle and prophecy of them all. And the whole course of garnering the fruits of his coming in the establishment of a church through the apostles he had chosen for the task is supernatural to the core. Assuredly if the redemptive process is not a supernatural operation the entire proclamation of Christianity is a lie as Paul declared with specific reference to one of its supernatural items. We as Christians are found false witnesses of God are preaching is in vain and our faith also vain. Nevertheless inconceivable as it would appear there are many voices raised about us which would fain persuad us in the professed interests of Christianity itself to attenuate or evacuate the supernatural even in redemption. That supernatural history of preparation for the redeemer we are asked did it indeed all happen as it is they recorded by the simple mind of writers. Are we not at liberty to read it merely as the record of what Pius Hearts meditating on the great past, fancied all to have occurred when God was with the fathers and to dig out from beneath the strata of its devout imaginations as veritable history. Only a sober narrative of how Israel walked in the felt presence of God and was led by his providence to ever clear and higher conceptions of his holy being and of its mission as his chosen people. And that supernatural figure which the evangelists and apostles have lived for us did it indeed ever walk this sin stricken earth of ours. Are we not bound to see in it as we are asked merely the projection of the hopes and fears swallowed up in hope of his devoted followers. Clothing with all imaginable heavenly virtues the dead form of their master snatched from their sight of whom they had hoped that it was he who should deliver Israel. And are we not bound reverently to draw aside the veil laid by such tender hands over the dead face that we may see beneath that the real Jesus dead indeed but a man of infinite sweetness of temper and depth of faith, from whose holy life we may even yet catch an inspiration and receive an impulse for good. And Peter and Paul and John in the rest of those whose hearts were set on fire by the spectacle of that great and noble life. Now we really to take their enthusiasm as the rule of our thought. Are we not bound? We are asked. Though honoring the purity of their fine hero worship, to curb the extravagance of their assertions and to follow the faith quickened in them by their master's example, while we correct the exuberance of their fancy in attributing to him superhuman qualities and performances. In a word, for let us put it at length plainly, are we not had liberty and we not bound to eviscerate Christianity of all that makes it a redemptive scheme of all that has given it power in the earth of all that has made it a message of hope and joy to lost men of all that belongs to its very heart's blood and essence as witnessed by all history and all experience alike and yet claim still to remain Christians. No, that are answer be. As Christian men are thousand times no. When the anti-supernaturalistic bias of this age attacks the supernatural in the very process of redemption and seeks to evaporate it into a set of platitudes about the guiding hand of God in history. The power of the man Jesus is pure faith over his followers imaginations and the imitation bias of the religion of Jesus. It has assaulted Christianity in the very citadel of its life. As Christian men we must assert with all vigor, the purity and the absoluteness of the supernatural in redemption. For, and let us add at once further that as Christian men we must retain a frank and hearty faith in a supernatural revelation. For how should we be advantaged by a supernatural redemption of which we knew nothing, who is competent to uncover to us the meaning of this great series of redemptive acts but God Himself. It is easy to talk of revelation by deed, but how little is capable of being revealed by even the mightest deeds unaccompanied by the explanatory word. 2000 years ago a child was born in Bethlehem who throve and grew up nobly lived a life of poverty and beneficence was truly slain and rose from the dead. What is that to us? After a little as his followers sat waiting in Jerusalem there was a rush as of mighty wind and an appearance of tongues of fire descending upon their heads. Strange, but what concern have we in it all? We require the revealing word to tell us who and what this goodly child was, why he lived and what he wrote by his death, what it meant that he could not be holden of the grave, and what those cloven tongues of flame signified before they can avail as redemptive facts to us. No earthly person knew or could know their import, no earthly insight was capable of divining it, no earthly authority could assure the world of any presumed meaning attached to them. None but God was in a position to know or assert their real significance. Only then, as God spaked through his servants the prophets and apostles, could the mighty deeds by which he would save the world, be given a voice and a message, be transformed into a gospel. And so the supernatural word receives its necessary position among the redemptive acts as their interpretation and their compliment. We cannot miss the fact that, from the beginning, the word of God took its honourable place among the redemptive deeds of God. God spaked to clear the record as significantly and as constantly as it declares that God did. And we cannot miss the fact that God's word, giving their meaning, their force, and their value to his redemptive acts, enters as vitally into our Christian faith and hope as the acts themselves. As Christian men, we cannot let slip our faith in the one without losing also our grasp upon the other. And this is the explanation, both on the one hand of the constancy of the hold which Christianity has kept upon the word of God. And on the other of the persistency of the assault which has been made upon it in the interests of an anti-supernaturalistic worldview. It is no idle task which has been set itself by naturalistic criticism, when it has undertaken to explain away the supernaturalism of this record of God's redemptive work, which we call the Bible. This is the rock upon which all its efforts to de-supernaturalize Christianity break. It is no OTO's traditionalism which leads the Christian man to cling to this word of the living God which has come down to him through the ages. It is his solar assurance that there has been a redemptive activity exercised by God in the world, the single Ariadne's thread by which he is enabled to trace the course of redemption through the ages. If God did not so speak of old to the fathers by the prophets, if he has not in the ends of these days so spoken to us in his son, he may indeed have intervened redemptively in the world, but to us it would be as if he had not. Only as his voice has pierced to us to declare his purpose. Can we read the riddle of his operations? Only as he interprets to us their significance can we learn the wonder of his ways? And just in proportion as our confidence in this interpretive word shall wane, in just that proportion shall we lose our hold upon the fact of a redemptive work of God in the world. That we may believe in a supernatural redemption, we must believe in a supernatural revelation, by which alone we can be assured that this and not something else was what occurred, and that this and not something other was what it meant. The Christian man cannot afford to relax in the least degree his entire confidence in a supernatural revelation. Five, and finally, we need to remind ourselves that as Christian men we must cherish a frank and hearty faith in a supernatural salvation. It is not enough to believe that God has intervened in this natural world of ours and brought a supernatural redemption, and that he has himself made known to men his mighty acts and unveiled to them the significance of his working. It is upon a field of the dead that the son of righteousness has risen and the shouts that announce his advent fall on death years, yet even though the morning stars should again sing for joy in the air be palpatent with the echo of the great proclamation, their voice could not penetrate the ears of the dead. As we sweep our eyes over the world lying in its wickedness, it is the valley of the prophets' vision which we see before us a valley that is filled with bones and low they are very dry. What benefit is there in proclaiming to dry bones even the greatest of redemptions? How shall we stand and cry? Oh, you dry bones, here you the word of the Lord. Invane the redemption, invane its proclamation unless they come a breath from heaven to breathe upon these slain that they may live. The redemption of Christ is therefore no more central to the Christian hope than the creative operations of the Holy Spirit upon the heart and the supernatural redemption itself would remain a mere name outside of us and beyond our reach, where it not realized in the subjective life by an equally supernatural application. Yet how easy it is, immersed in an anti-supernaturalistic world to forget this our sound confession. Are we not men? We are asked and is not the individuality of every human being a sacred thing. Must not each be the architect of his own fortunes, the creator of his own future, not indeed apart from the influence of the Holy Spirit but certainly without his compulsion. Is it not mere fanaticism to dream that the very penitrillium of our personality is invaded by an alien power and the whole trend of our lives reversed in an instant of time independently of our previous choice? Lead, lead certainly we may be by the Holy Spirit but assuredly our manhood is respected and no non-ethical cataclysms are wrought in our lives by intrusive powers, not for sought and then yielded to at our own proper motion. But alas alas did things are not led. Of course the Christian is led by the Holy Spirit and let us see to it that we heartily acknowledge it and fully recognize this directive supernaturalism throughout the Christian life. But that it may become Christian and so come under the leading of the Spirit, the dead soul needs something more than leading. It needs reanimation, resurrection, regeneration, recreation. So the scriptures unwearingly teach us and so the Christian must with all frankness and emphasis constantly maintain. The Christian man is not the product of the regenerative forces of nature, under however divine a direction. He is not an evolution out of the natural man. He is a new creation. He has not made himself by however wary a walk, letting the ape and tiger die and cherishing his higher ideals until they become dominant in his life. He is not merely the old man improved. He is a new man recreated in Christ Jesus by the almighty power of the Holy Spirit, by a power comparable only to that by which God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. As well might it be contended that alasarus not only came forth from the tomb, but rose from the dead by his own will and at his own motion, as that the Christian man not only of his own desire works out his salvation with fear and trembling, in the knowledge that it is God who works in him both the willing and the doing according to his own good pleasure. But as even initiated that salvation in his soul by an act of his own will and a court. He lives by the virtue of the life that has been given him and prior to the inception of that life of course he has no power of action and it is of the utmost importance that as Christian men we should not lower our testimony to this true supernaturalness of our salvation. We confess that it was God who made us men, let us confess with equal heartiness that it is God who makes us Christians. Of such sort then is the supernaturalism which is involved in the confession of Christians. We have made it no part of our present task to enumerate all the ways in which the frank recognition of the supernatural enters into the very essence of Christianity. Much less do we say here to discriminate between the several modes of supernatural action which Christian thought is bound to admit. We have fancy did well however to bring together a few of the instances in which the maintenance of the occurrence of the absolute supernatural is incumbent on every Christian man. Thus we may fortify ourselves against that unconscious yielding of the citadel of our faith to which everyone is exposed to breathes the atmosphere of our unbelieving and encroaching world. The confession of a supernatural guard who may and does act in a supernatural mode and who acting in a supernatural mode has wrought out for us a supernatural redemption interpreted in a supernatural revelation and applied by the supernatural operations of his spirit. This confession constitutes the core of the Christian profession. Only he who holds this faith, whole and entire has a right to the Christian name, only he who can hope to conserve the fullness of the Christian truth. Let us see to it that under whatever pressure and amid whatever difficulties we make it heartily and frankly our confession, and think and live a like in its strength and by its light. So doing we shall find ourselves in trench against the assaults of the world's anti-supernaturalism and able by God's grace to witness a good confession in the midst of its most insidious attacks.

The Hundred Best English Poems,Various,79424,7.0,"September 19, 2020",[],0,"lease visitlibriVox.org. Recording by Bruce Kachak, the hundred best English poems by various authors. Prefatory note. Let me frankly admit to begin with that the attractiveness and probable selling qualities of the title of this little book, the hundred best English poems. Proved, when it had been once thought of, two powerful arguments for it to be abandoned. I am fully conscious of the presumptions such a title implies in an unknown selector, but at the same time I submit that only a plebiscite of duly qualified lovers of poetry could make a selection that could claim to deserve this title beyond all question. And such a plebiscite is of course impossible. I can claim no more than that my attempt to realize this title is an honest one, and I can assert without fear of contradiction that every one of the poems I have included is a G.M. of Purist-Raisarine. That non can be too often read or too often repeated to oneself. That every one of them should be known by heart by every lover of good literature, so that each may become as it were, a part of his inner being. I have not inserted any poems by living authors. I have taken the greatest care with the texts of the poems. The additions followed have been mentioned in every case. I have scarulously retained a punctuation of these original additions, and only modernize the spelling of the old copies. While I have not ventured to a met, any part of any poem. I have not supplied titles of my own, but have adopted those I found already employed in the additions used as models, or in some of the cases in which I found non, have merely added a descriptive one such as Song From Don 1. In conclusion, my very warmest thanks are due to Messer's Macmillan and Company Limited for permission to include Tennyson's Crossing the Bar. To Mr. D. Not, for permission to insert WWE Henlies to RT-HB and Margarita Sororay. To Messer's Smith Elder and Company for a like privilege in regard to Browning's epilogue, and to Mr. Lloyd Osborne and Messer's Chattowen Winders, for permission to reproduce Stevenson's Requiem.

Psychology of the Unconscious,Carl Gustav Jung,57776,30.0,"November 19, 2020",[],0,"sit www.libervox.org. Psychology of the Unconscious by Carl Jung, Section 1. An introduction to psychoanalysis and analytic psychology. When Professor Freud or Vienna made his early discoveries in the realm of the neuroses and announced that the basis and origin of the various symptoms grouped under the terms hysteria and neuroses lay in unfulfilled desires and wishes, unexpressed and unknown to the patient for the most part, and concerned chiefly with the sexual instinct. It was not realized what far-reaching influence this unpopular and bitterly attacked theory would exert on the understanding of human life in general. For this theory has so widened in its scope that its application has now extended beyond a particular group of pathologic states. It has, in fact, led to a new evaluation of the whole conduct of human life. A new comprehension has developed which explains those things which formally were unexplained, and there is offered an understanding not only of the symptoms of a neurosis and the phenomena of conduct but the product of the mind has expressed in myths and religions. This amazing growth has proceeded steadily in an ever-wildening fashion despite opposition as violent as any of which we have knowledge in the past. The criticism originally directed towards the little understood in much disliked sexual conception now includes the further teachings of a psychology, which by the application to it of such damning phrases as mystical, metaphysical, and sacrilegious, is condemned as unscientific. To it, to the general confusion and misunderstanding surrounding this new school of thought, there has a reason a division amongst the leaders themselves, so that there now exists two schools, led respectively, by Professor Sigmund Freud of Vienna, and Dr. Carl Jung of Zurich, referred to in the literature as the Vienna School and the Zurich School. It is very easy to understand that criticism and opposition should develop against a psychology so difficult to comprehend and so disturbing to the ideas which have been held by humanity for ages, a psychology which furthermore requires a special technique as well as an observer trained to recognize and appreciate in psychological phenomena, a verification of the statement that there is no such thing as chance, and that every act in every expression has its own meaning determined by the inner feelings and wishes of the individual. It is not as simple matter to come out boldly and state that every individual is to a large extent the determiner of his own destiny for only by poets and philosophers has this idea been put forth, not by science. And it is a brave act to make this statement with full consciousness of all its meaning and to stand ready to prove it by scientific reasoning and procedure, developed entirely through empirical investigation and through analysis of individual cases, Freudian psychology seems particularly to belong to that conception of Max Mueller's that, and empirical acquaintance with facts rises to a scientific knowledge of facts, as soon as the mind discovers beneath the multiplicity of single productions, the unity of an organics system. Psychoanalysis is the name given to the method developed for reaching down into the hidden depths of the individual to bring to light the underlying motives and determinants of his symptoms and attitudes, and to reveal the unconscious tendencies which lie behind actions and reactions and which influence development and determine the relations of life itself. The result of digging down into the hidden psyche has been to produce a mass of material from below the threshold of consciousness, so astonishing and disturbing and out of relation with the previously held values, as to arose in any one unfamiliar with the process, the strongest antagonism and criticism. Although originally studied only as a therapeutic method for the sick, it was soon realized through an analysis of normal people, house light, where the differences in the content of the unconscious of the sick and of the normal. The differences observed were seen to be rather in the reactions to life and to the conflicts produced by contending forces in the individual. These conflicts usually not fully perceived by the individual and having to do with a objectionable desires and wishes that are not in keeping with the conscious idea of self, produce marked effects which are expressed either in certain opinions, prejudices, attitudes of conduct, fault the actions are in some definite pathologic symptom. As Dr. Jung says, he who remains healthy has to struggle with the same complexes that cause the neurotic to fall ill. In a valuable book called The Neighbor, Written by the Late Professor in Shailer of Harvard University, there occurs this very far reaching statement. It is hardly too much to say that all the important areas of conduct, all the burdens of men or of societies are caused by the inadequacies in the association of the primal animal emotions with those mental powers which have been so rapidly developed in mankind. This statement reached by a process of reasoning and a method of thought and study entirely different from psychoanalysis, nevertheless so completely expresses and brief form the very basis of the pastlets developed through psychoanalysis that I quote it here. Such as statement made in the course of general examination of human relations does not arouse opposition nor seem to be so difficult of acceptance, it appears to be the individual application of these conceptions that has roused such bitter antagonism and violent denunciations. Rightly understood and used psychoanalysis may be compared to surgery for psychoanalysis stands in the same relation to the personality as surgery does to the body and they aim at parallel results. It is well recognized that in that last analysis nature is the real physician the healer of wounds prior to the development of our modern asepsis and surgical technique the healing produced by nature was most often of a very faulty and imperfect type. It is scarced distorted and crippled limbs with functions impaired or incompatibility resulted from the wounds or else nature was unable to cope with the hurt and the injured one succumbed. Science has been steadily working for centuries with the aim of understanding nature and finding means to aid in cooperate with her so that healing could take place with the least possible loss of functional permanent injury to the individual. Marvelous results have rewarded these persistent efforts as the brilliant achievements of surgery plainly indicate mean time however little thought was given to the possibility of any scientific method being available to help man overcome the wounds in conflicts taking place in his soul. Hearts which retarded his development and progress as a personality and which frequently in the struggle resulted in physical pains and symptoms of the most buried character. I was left solely to religion and metaphysics now however the same assistance that surgery has given to the physical body psychoanalysis attempts to give to the personality that he cannot always succeed is as much to be expected and more than that surgery does not always succeed for the analytic work requires much of the individual. No real result can be attained if he has not already developed a certain quality of character and intelligence which makes it possible for him to submit himself to a facing of his naked soul and to the pain and suffering which this often entails. Here has in no other relation in life and absolute truth and an absolute honesty or the only basis of action since deception of any kind deceives no one but the individual himself and acts as a boomerang defeating his own aims. Such deep searching and penetrating into the soul is not something to be undertaken lightly nor to be considered a trivial or simple matter and the fact is that where a strong compulsion is lacking such a sickness or a situation too difficult to meet much courage is required to undertake it. In order to understand this psychology which is prevailing all realms of thought and seems destined to be a new psychological philosophical system for the understanding and practical advance of human life it would be necessary to go somewhat into detail regarding its development and presence status for in this new direction lies its greatest value and its greatest danger. The things of this work were first published in 1895 in a book entitled Studio and Uber history and contained the joint investigations into his area of Dr. Brewer of Vienna and his pupil Dr. Sigmund Freud. The results of their investigations seemed to show that the various symptoms grouped under the title of his area where the result of the emotionally colored reminiscences which all unknown to the conscious waking self were really actively expressing themselves through the surrogate form of symptoms in that these experiences, although forgotten by the patient could be reproduced in the emotional content discharged. The hypnosis was the means used to enable the physician to penetrate deeply into the forgotten memory sport was found through hypnosis that these lost incidents and circumstances were not really lost at all but only dropped from consciousness and were capable of being revived when given the proper stimuli. The astonishing part about it was that with the revival of these memories and their accompanying painful and disturbing emotions the symptoms disappeared this led naturally to the conclusion that these symptoms were dependent upon some emotional disturbance or psyche trauma which have been inadequately expressed and that in order to cure the patient when merely had to establish the connection between the memory and the emotions which properly belong to it, letting the emotion work itself out through a reproduction of the forgotten scene. With further investigation Freud found that hypnosis was unnecessary for the revival of the forgotten experiences and that it was possible to obtain the lost emotional material in the conscious and normal state. For this purpose the patient was encouraged to assume a passive non-critical attitude and simply let his thoughts flow speaking of whatever came into his mind holding nothing back. During this free and easy discussion of his life and conditions directed by the law of association of ideas reference was invariably made to the experiences or thoughts which were the most effective and disturbing elements. It was seen to be quite impossible to avoid this indirect revelation because of a strength of the emotions surrounding these ideas and the effect of the conscious which is repressed and pleasant feelings. This important group of ideas or impressions with the feelings and emotions clustered around them which are betrayed through this process was called by a complex. However with the touching of the complex which always contains feelings and emotions so painful or unpleasant as to be unacceptable to consciousness and which are therefore repressed and hidden. Great difficulty disappeared for very often the patient came to a sudden stop and could apparently recall nothing more. Memory gaps were frequent relations twisted etc. Evidently some force vanished these memories so that the person was quite honest in saying that he could remember nothing or that there was nothing to tell. This kind of forgetfulness was called repression and is the normal mechanism by which nature protects the individual from such painful feelings as are caused by unpleasant and unacceptable experiences and thoughts. The recognition of his egoistic nature and the often quite unbearable conflict of his weaknesses with his feelings of idealism. At this early time great attention was given towards developing a technique which would render more easy the reproduction of these forgotten memories for with the abandon of hypnosis. It was seen that some unknown active force was at work which not only banished painful memories and feelings but also prevented their return this was called resistance. This resistance was found to be the important mechanism which interfered with a free flow of thought and produced the greatest difficulty in the further conduct of the analysis. It appeared under various guises and frequently manifested itself in intellectual objections based on reasoning ground. In criticism directed towards the analyst or in criticism of the method itself and finally often in a complete blocking of expression so that until the resistance was broken nothing more could be produced. It was necessary then to find some aid by which these resistances could be overcome and the repressed memories and feelings revived and set free. It was proven again and again that even though the person was not at all aware of concealing within himself some emotionally disturbing feeling or experience with which his symptoms were associated. Yet such was the fact in that under proper conditions this material could be brought into consciousness. This realm where these unknown but disturbing emotions were hidden was called the unconscious the unconscious also being a name used arbitrarily to indicate all that material of which the person is not aware of the given time but not conscious. This term is used very loosely in 40 in psychology and is not intended to provoke any academic discussion but to conform strictly to the dictionary classification of a negative concept which can either be described nor defined. The idea or feeling is unconscious merely means to indicate that the individual is unaware at that time of its existence or that all the material of which he is unaware at a given time is unconscious with the discovery of the significant simulation to his area of these varied experiences and forgotten memories which always led into the erotic realm and usually were carried far back into early childhood. The idea of infantile sexual trauma as a cause of this neurosis developed contrary to the usual belief that children have no sexuality and that only a puberty does it suddenly arise. It was definitely shown that there was a very marked kind of sexuality among children of the most tender years entirely instinctive and capable of producing a grave effect on the entire later life. Further investigations carried into the lives of normal people disclosed quite as many psychic and sexual traumas in their early childhood as in the lives of the patients. Therefore the conception of the infantile sexual trauma as the ethylological factor was abandoned in favor of the infantilism of sexuality itself. In other words it was soon realized that many of the sexual traumas which were placed in their early childhood by these patients did not really exist except in their own fantasies and probably were produced as a defense against the memories of their own childhood sexual activities. These experiences led to a deep investigation into the nature of the child's sexuality and developed the ideas which Freud incorporated in a work called three contributions to the sexual theory. The key found so many variations and manifestations of sexual activity even among young children that he realized that this activity was the normal, although entirely unconscious expression of the child's developing life and while not comparable to the adult sexuality nevertheless produced a very definite influence and effect on the child's life. The child's expressions of this instinct he called polymorphous perverse because in many ways they resembled in the various abnormalities called perversions when found among adults under certain conditions. In the light of these additional investigations Freud was led to changes formulation for instead of the symptoms of the neurotic patient being due to definite sexual experiences they seem to be determined by his reactions towards his own sexual constitution. And the kind of repression to which these instincts were subjected. Perhaps one of the greatest sources of misunderstanding and difficulty in this whole subject lies in the term sexuality for Freud's conception of this is entirely different from that of the popular sense. He conceived sexuality to be practically synonymous with the word love and to include under this term all those tender feelings and emotions which have had their origin in our primitive erotic source even if now their primary aim is entirely lost in another substitute for it. But it must also be born in mind that Freud strictly emphasizes the psychic side of sexuality and its importance as well as the somatic expression. Must never be forgotten through this careful investigation of the psychic life of the individual the tremendous influence and importance of fantasy making for the fate was definitely shown. It was discovered that the indulgence in daydreams and fantasies was practically universal not only among children but among adults that even whole lives were being lived out in a fantastic world created by the dreamer of world we're in he could fulfill all those wishes and desires which were found to be too difficult. Or impossible to satisfy in the world of reality. Much of this fantasy thinking was seen to be scarcely conscious but arose from unrealized wishes, desires and strivings which could only express themselves through veiled symbols in the form of fantastic structures not understood nor fully recognized. Indeed it is perhaps one of the most common human experiences to find queer thoughts, undesired ideas and images forcing themselves upon one's attention to such an extent that the will has to be employed to push them out of mind. It is not unusual to discover long forgotten impressions of childhood assuming a fantastic shape and memory and to out upon as though they were still of importance. This material afforded a rich view for those searches into the soul for through the operation of all of association of ideas these fantastic products trace back to their origin, reveal the fact that instead of being meaningless or foolish they were produced by a definite process and arose from distinct wishes and desires which unconsciously bail themselves in these mysterious forms and pictures. It is considered that the most completely unconscious product of an individual is as dream and therefore professor Freud turned his attention from fantasies and daydreams to the investigation of a nightly dream of his patients to discover whether they were through light upon the painful feelings and ideas, compressed out of consciousness and therefore inaccessible to direct revelation. This brilliant idea seemed led to a rich fruity for it became evident that contrary to the usual conception of the dream is a fantastic and absurd jumble of heterogeneous fragments having no real relation to the life of the individual. The most successful of meaning in fact it is usually concerned with the problem of life most pressing at the time which expresses itself not directly but in symbolic form so as to be unrecognized in this way the individual gains and expression and fulfillment of his unrealized wish or desire. The most discover of the symbolic nature of the dream and the fantasy was brought about entirely through the associative method and developed empirically through investigations of the dreams of many people. In this manner it became evident that certain ideas and objects which we occurred again and again in the dreams and fantasies of different people were definitely associated with certain unconscious or unrecognized wishes and desires and were repeatedly used by the mind to express these meanings to direct form was repressed and unallowed. Thus certain dream expressions and figures were in a general way considered to be rather deafness symbols of these repressed ideas and feelings found in the unconscious through comparative and parallel study it's been appeared that there was a similar mechanism at work in myths and fairy tales and that the relationship between the dreams and fantasies of an individual and the myths and folktales of a people was so close that Abraham could say that the myth is a fragment of the infantile so life of the race and the dream is the myth of the individual. Thus through relating his dreams the patient himself furnished the most important means of gaining access to the unconscious and disturbing complexes with which his symptoms were connected. Besides the dream analysis the patient furnished other means of revelation of his complexes his mannerisms and unconscious acts is opening remarks to his physician is emotional reactions to certain ideas ensure the whole behavior and verbal expressions of the individual reveal his inner nature and problems. Through all this work it became clear that in the emotional nature lay the origin not only of the various nervous illnesses themselves but also of the isolated symptoms and individual idiosyncquisies and peculiarities which are the part of all humanity and that the pathogenic cause of the disturbances lies not in the ignorance of individuals but in those inner resistances which are the underlying basis of this ignorance. Therefore the aim of the therapy became not merely the relief of the ignorance but the searching out and combating of these resistances. It becomes evident from even this brief description of the analytic procedure that we are dealing with a very complex and delicate material and with the technique which needs to make definite use of all influences available for the help of the patient. It is long been recognized that the relation established between physician and patient has a great effect upon the medical assistance which he is able to render. In other words if a confidence and personal regard developed in the patient towards the physician the latter's advice was just so much more efficacious. This personal feeling has been frankly recognized and made of distinct service in psychoanalytic treatment under the name of transference. It is through the aid of this definite relationship which must be established in the one being analyzed towards the analyst that it is possible to deal with the unconscious and organized resistances which so easily blind the individual and render the acceptance of the new valuations very difficult to the raw and sensitive soul. For example, the sexual instinct in the production of the neurosis and also in its determining power upon the personality of the normal individual does not imply that he does not also recognize other determinants at the root of human conduct as for instance instinct for preservation of life and the ego principle itself. But these motives are not so violently forbidden and repressed as the sexual impulse and therefore because of that repressive force and the strength of the impulse he considers this primary in its influence upon the human being. The importance of this instinct upon human life is clearly revealed by the great place given to it under the name of love in our literature poetry romance in our beauty from the beginning of recorded time. This light he cannot seem extraordinary that a difficulty or disturbance in this emotional field should produce set far reach in consequences for the individual. The sexual impulse is often compared with that of hunger and this craving of need lying in all humanity is called by Freud libido. rights of sexual one.","Psychology, Religion, Social Science (Culture & Anthropology)",English,16:09:34,Jim Locke,['Freudian'],"['Carl Jung', 'Shailer', 'Freud', 'Abraham', ""Max Mueller's"", 'Jung', 'Sigmund Freud']","['Zurich', 'Vienna', 'boomerang']",[],0,1,1,0,4,1,0

The wind holled out of the northwest, blind with snow and barbed with ice crystals. All the way up the half-mile precipice had fingered and arranged away at groaning ice slabs. It screamed over the top, world snow and a dervish dancer on the hollow there, piled snow into the long furrow, plowed ruler straight through streamlined hummings of snow. The sun glinted on black rock glazed by ice, chasm's and ridges and bridges of ice. It lit the snow slope to a frozen glare, penciled black shadow down the long furrow and flashed at the furrow's end on a thing of metal and plastics and artifact thrown down in the dead wilderness. Nothing grew, nothing flew, nothing walked, nothing talked, but the thing in the hollow was stirring and stiff jerks like a snake with its back broken, or a clockwork toy running down. When the movement stopped there was a click, you know, strange sound began. Thin scratchy and audible, more than a yard away, weary but still cocky. They're leaked from the shape of the hollow of the sound of a human voice. I've tried my hands and arms and they seem to work, it began. I've wiggled my toes with entire success, it's swell on the cards, I'm all in one piece and I've broken up at all. Although I don't see how it could happen. Right now I don't feel like struggling up and finding out. I'm fine where I am. I'll just lie here for a while and relax and get some of the story on tape. This suits got a built-in recorder and might as well use it. There were even if I'm not as well as I feel I'll leave a message. You probably know we're back and wonder what went wrong. I suppose I'm in a state of shock. That's why I can't seem to get up. Who wouldn't be shocked after a look like that? I've always been lucky I guess. Luck got me in place in the whale. Sure I'm a good astronomer but so are lots of other guys. If I were 10 years older it would have been an honor being picked with the first long jump in the first Starship Ever. At my age she was luck. You want an all the shipworked well she did. At Lekobomb we got lined up between earth and Mars you'll remember and James pushed the button mark jump. Took his finger off the button and there we were. Alpha Centauri. Two months later your time one second later by us. We covered our whole survey assignment like that. Smooth as a pint of old and mild which right now I could certainly use. Better yet would be a pint of hot black coffee with sugar in it. Ailing that I could even go for a long drink of cold water. There was never anything wrong with the whale till right at the end and even that I died if it was the ship itself and followed things up. That was some survey assignment we astronomers really lived. Wait till you see but of course you won't. I could weep when I think of those miles of lovely color film all gone up and smoke. I'm shocked all right. I never said who I was. Matt Hennessy from far side of observatory back of the moon. Just back from approving flight come astronomical survey and the starship whale. Whoever you are who finds this tape your maid take it to any radio station in newspaper office you'll find you can name your press and don't take any wooden nickels. Where did I got to? I told you how we happened to find Chang had night. Well that's what the natives called it. Walking talking natives on a blue sky planet with 1.1g gravity in a 20% oxygen atmosphere at 15 psi. The odds against finding Chang in a six sun survey on the first star jump ever must be up in the Googles. We certainly were lucky. The Chang natives aren't very technical. Haven't got space travel for instance. They're good astronomers though. We were able to show them our son and their telescopes. And their way they're highly civilized people. Look more like cats than people but their people all right. If you doubt it, chew these facts over. One they learned our language in four weeks. When I say they I mean a 10 man team of them. Two they brew a near beer that's a lot nearer than the can to stuff we had aboard the whale. Three they have a great sense of humor. A ran rather to silly practical jokes but still. Can't say I care for that hotfoot and belly left stuff myself but tastes differ. Four the 10 man language team also learned chess and table tennis. But while go on, people who talk English drink beer like jokes and beat me at chess are table tennis are people for my money even if they look like tigers and trousers. It was funny the way they won all the time at table tennis. They certainly weren't so hot at it. Maybe that 10% extra gravity put us off our strokes. As for chess, Svendalov was our champion. He won sometimes. The rest of us seemed to lose whichever Chang see we played. There again it wasn't so much that they were good. How could they be in the time? It was more that we all seemed to make silly mistakes when we played them and that's fatal in chess. Of course it's a screwy situation playing chess with something that grows its own for a code as yellow eyes and inch and a half long and long wide whiskers. Could you have kept your mind on the game? And don't think I fell victim to their feline charm. The children were pets but you didn't feel like patting the adults and their big grinning heads. Personally I didn't like the one I knew best. He was called, well we call them Charlie and he was the fnologist and bassitor, contact man or whatever you'd like to call him. We came back with us. Why I'd just liked him was because he was always trying to get the edge on you. All the time he had to be top. Great sense of humor of course. I nearly broke by neck and that butter's slid he fixed up in the middle alley away to the whale's engine room. Charlie laughed fit to bust everyone laughed. I even laughed myself though doing it hurt me more than the tumblehead. Yes life and soul of the party old Charlie. My last side of the minnow was a cabin full of dead and dying man. The sweetest stink of burned flesh and the choking the reek of scorching insulation. The bold, jolting and shuddering and beginning to break up. In the middle of the flames, still unheard was Charlie. He was laughing. I got it dark out here. Wonder how high I am. Must be all of 50 miles and doing 800 miles an hour at least. I'll be doing more than that when I land. What's final velocity for a 50 mile fall? I suppose the same as the scape 24 miles an hour. I'll make a mess. That's better. Why didn't I close my eyes before? Those star streaks made me dizzy. I'll make a nice shooting star when I hit air. Come to think of it. I must be deep in air now. Let's take a look. It's getting lighter. Like great knives. I don't seem to be falling as fast as I expected though. Almost seem to be floating. Let's switch on the radio until the world hello. Hello, earth. Hello again. And goodbye. Sorry about that. I passed out. I don't know what I said. If anything, and the suit recorder has no playbag or eraser, well it must have happened is that the suit ran out of oxygen or air laws consciousness due to an oxy. I dreamt I switched on the radio, but I actually switched on the emergency tank. I think the Lord and that brought me around. Come to think about why I cracked the suit and breathed fresh air instead of bottled. No. I'd have to get up to do that. And I think I'll just lie here a little bit longer and get properly arrested up if I write try anything big like standing up. I was telling about the return journey wasn't I. The long jump I had called which should have dumped us between the orbits of earth and Mars instead of which when James took his finger off the bottom, the mass detector showed nothing except the noise level of the universe. We were out in that no place for a day. We astronomers had to establish our exact position relative to the solar system. The crew had to find out exactly what went wrong. The physicists had to make mystic passes in front of meters and muddler about residual folds and stressed free space. Our task was easy because we were about half a light year from the sun. The cruise job was also easy. They found what went wrong unless and half an hour. It still seems incredible. To program the ship for a star jump you merely told where you were and where you wanted to go. In practical terms I'd entail the first series of exact measurements which had to be translated into the somewhat abschuse coordinate system we used based on the topological order of mass points in the galaxy. Then you cut a tape on the computer and hit the button. Nothing was wrong with the computer. Nothing was wrong with the engines. We'd hit the right button and we'd gone to the place we'd aimed for. All we'd done was aimed for the wrong place. It hurts me to tell you this and I'm just attached personnel with no space flight tradition. In practical terms one highly trained crew member had punched a wrong pattern of holes on the tape, another equally skilled had failed to notice this when reading back. The childish error, highly improbable, twice repeated thus squaring the improbability. Incredible but that's what happened. Anyway we took good care with the next lot of measurements. That's why we were out there still long. They were across checked about five times. I got sick so I cloned into a space to and went outside and took some photographs of the sun which I hoped would help to determine hydrogen density in the outer regions. When I got back everything was ready. We disposed ourselves about the control room in our lacks for all we were worth. We were all praying that this time nothing would go wrong and all looking forward to seeing Earth again after four months of subjective time away. Except for Charlie, he was still chuckling and shaking his head and capped in James, it was glaring at Charlie and obviously wishing him a dignity permitted him to tear Charlie limb from limb. Then James pressed the button. Using twang like a boastring, I felt myself turned inside out past through a small sivin' poured back into shape. The entire bow wall screen was full of Earth. Something was wrong all right. In this time it was much, much worse. We'd come out of the jump about 200 miles above the Pacific pointed straight down, traveling at a relative speed of about 2,000 miles an hour. It was a fantastic situation. Here was the whale, the most powerful ship ever built, which could cover 50 light years in a subjective time of one second, and it was helpless. For, as of course you know, the star drive couldn't be used again for at least two hours. The whale also had iron rockets, of course, the standard, deuterium futeing thing with direct conversion. As again you know, this is good for interplanetary flight because you can run it continuously and it has extremely high exhaust velocity, but in our situation it was no good because it has rather a low thrust. It would have taken more time than we had to deflect us enough to avoid a smash. We had five minutes to abandon ship. James got us all into the minnow at a dead run. There was no time to take anything at all except the clothes we stood in. The minnow was meant for short heavy hops to planets or asteroids. In addition to the iron drive it had emergency atomic rockets using steam for reaction mass. We thank God for that when gizemian cancelled our downward velocity with them in a few seconds. We curved away up over China in from about 50 miles high we saw the whale hit the Pacific. 600 tons of mass at well over 2,000 miles an hour making all mighty splash. By now you'll have diaries down but I doubt they'll salvage much you can use. I wonder why James went down with a ship as the saying is not that it made any difference. It must have broken it's hard to know that his lovely ship was getting the chopper or did he suspect another human error. We didn't have time to think about that or even to get the radio working. The steam rockets blew up. Porque Zemian was burnt to a crisp. And you think that saved me was the space who I was wearing. I snapped the faceplate down because the cabin was filling with fumes. I saw Charlie coming out of the toilet. That's how he escaped and I saw him beginning to laugh. Then the port-side collapsed and I fell out. I saw the launch spinning away glowing red against a perplish black sky. I tumbled head over heels toward the huge curve she lived over 50 miles below. I shut my eyes and that's about all I remember. I don't see how any of us could have survived. I think we're all dead. I'll have to get up and crack this soon let's see my errand but I can't. I fell 50 miles without a parachute. I'm dead so I can't stand up. There was silence a while except for the vicious hull of the wind. Then snow began to shift on the ledge. A man crawled stiffly out and came shakely to his feet. He moved slowly around for some time. After about two hours he returned to the hollow, squatted down and switched on the recorder. The voice began again considerably weirier. Hello there. I'm in the bleakest wilderness I've ever seen. This place makes the moon look cozy. There's precipice around me every way but one and that's up. So it's up I'll have to go to last find a way to go down. I've been chewing snow to quench my thirst but I could eat a horse. I picked up a shirt waveboard cast on my suit but it couldn't understand a word. Not English, not French and there I stick. Listen to it for 15 minutes just to hear a human voice again. I have in much hope of reaching anyone with my five millawatt suit transmitter but I'll keep trying. Just before I start the climb there are two things I want to get on tape. The first is how I got here. I have remembered something from my military training. When I did some parachute jumps, terminal velocity for a human body falling through the air is about 120 MPH. Falling 50 miles is no worse than falling 500 feet. You'd be lucky to live through a 500 foot fall true but I've been lucky. The suit is bulky but light and probably slowed my fall. I hit a 60 mile an hour updraft this side of the mountains. Skitted downhill through about half a mile of snow and fetched up in a drift. The suit is part worn but still operational. I'm fine. The second thing I want is say is about the chingsie and here it is. Watch out for them. Those jokers are dangerous. I'm not telling how because I've got a scientific reputation to watch. You'll have to figure it out for yourselves. Here are the clues. One, the chingsie talk and laugh but after all they aren't human. On an alien world 100 like years away, why shouldn't alien talents develop? A talent that's so uncertain and rudimentary here that most people don't believe it might be highly developed out there. To the whale expedition did find till it found chang. Then it hit a seam of bad luck. Real stinking bad luck that went on and on till it looks fishy. We lost the ship, we lost the launch. All but one of us lost our lives we couldn't even win a game of ping pong. So what is luck good or bad? Scientetically speaking, future chance events are by definition chance. They can turn out favourable or not. One of a pondereness of chance events is occurred unfavorably. You've got bad luck. There's a fancy name for a lot of chance results that didn't go your way. But the gambler defines it differently for him luck refers to the future. And you've got bad luck when future chance events won't go your way. Scientific investigation into this have been inconclusive. But everyone knows that some people are lucky and others aren't. We've got our hints and glimmers. The fumbling touch of a rudimentary talent. There's the evil eye legend and Jonah. Bad luck bringers. Superstition maybe. But ask the insurance companies about accident prones. What's in a name? Call a man on lucky and your superstitious call a maxed in prone and that's son business sense. I've said enough. All the same search the space flight records talk to the actuaries when a ship is working perfectly and is operated by a hand-picked crew of highly trained men and perfect condition. How often is it wrecked by a series of silly errors happening one after another and defiance of probability? I'll sign off of two thoughts, one depressing and one cheering. A single chingsy erectile ship in her launch. Her trap could a whole planet full of them do. On the other hand, a talent that manipulates chance advances bound to be chancey no matter how highly developed it can't be surefire. The proof is that I've survived to tell the tale. At 20 below zero, at 50 miles an hour, the wind ravaged the mountain. Peering through his polarized visor at the white waist and the snow field air hollowed over it, sliding and stumbling with every step on a slope that got gradually steeper and seemed to go on forever.

Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge red soft hands, slapped them into a floor and senator mouth. Back to earth, then spin around and shoot right back again in the trail of the war rockets and blast it one another in galactic fury, decide a lot behind gutt it racks of ships, salvaging anybody still intact after the conflict. Two men, Roy sand himself, sharing a cozy mortship with a hundred other men who had forgotten quite suddenly over to talk again. Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face. Working under the husk of his star of dyes and star of limbs, star for life, star for action. This would be his last trip or he'd know the reason why. Sam, Burnett jerk, racist voice clip through the drainage preservative love, bounded against glass hat retorts echoed from the refrigerator shelves. Burnett stared at the table bodies as if they would leap to life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins. Sam, on the double up the rungs. Burnett closed his eyes and set a couple of words firmly, nothing was worth running for anymore. Another body there had been one hundred thousand bodies proceeding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood cooling in it. Shaky has had he walked on steadily toward the rungs that gwined up into the airlock control room sector of the rocket. He climbed without making any noise on the rungs. He kept making the one thing he couldn't forget. You never catch up with a war. All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across stars, the whamming of steel nose bombs into elusive targets, the titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the exotic glory are always a million miles ahead. He bit his teeth together. You never catch up with a war. You come along when spaces settle back when the vacuum has stopped trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along the dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of its original acceleration and no particular direction. You can only see it. You don't hear anything in space but your own heart kick your ribs. You see bodies each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by grinding collisions, toss from motherships and dancing head over feet forever and forever with no goal. If it's a flesh and ruptured space suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred million centuries, and they kept dancing without music until you extend it the retriever claw and called them into the airlock. That was all the warplore you got. Nothing but the stunned shivering silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shells filling up too quickly with men would once loved laughing. You wonder who all the men were and who the next ones would be. After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing your job with mechanical hands. But even a machine breaks down. Sam, rice turned swiftly as Brinette dragged himself up the ladder, red and warm, rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy official. Take a look at this. Brinette caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong with the body. His experience glass knew that he didn't know what it was. Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead. Brinette didn't say anything but he climbed the rest of the way stood quietly in the grave metal airlock. The official was as delicately made as a fine white spider. Islands closed were faintly blue. The hair was thin so constraints of pale gold, waved and pressed close to the vain skull. Where the thin lip mouth fell open a cluster of needle tip teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed completely in milk white synthesolk, a holstered gun at the middle. Brinette rubbed his jaw. Well, rice exploded. His eyes were hot and his young sharp cut face hot and black. Good Lord Sam. Do you know who this is? Brinette scald on easily and said no. It's left-foot rice retorted. Brinette said, Letha and then oh yes. Creeers made you dome on that right. Don't say it calm Sam say it big say it big if Lefla is here in space then then. Then Creeers not far away from them. Brinette shrugged more bodies more people more wore look the hell. What the hell? He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to somebody else. Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. Snap out of it Sam. Think. Creeer, the almighty in our territory is right hand man dead. That means Creeer was in the accident too. Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves. Look rice you knew it began. I've been added ever since the venous birth must started. It's been see-sewing back and forth since the day you played hockey in the tent green and I've been in the thick of it. When there's nothing left-foot, seared memories. I'll be prowling through the void picking up warriors and taking the back to the good greener. Grizzly yes, but it's routine. As for Creeer, if he's anywhere around he smart every precaution is taken to protect that one. But Lefla, his body must mean something. And if it does, have we got guns aboard this mork ship? Are we about to cruise or to go against him? Will radio for help? Yeah, there's a warship within our radio range. 700,000 miles will get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has swept out past earth and a new war concerning Io. That's out rice. Rice stood about three inches below Sam, Burnett six foot one. Joel Harden determined. He stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted. Your one hell of a Patriot Sam Burnett. Burnett reached out with one long finger tapped it quietly on rice' burial chest. Hall a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and days and see how patriotic you feel. All these fine musseled lads blowed it and crushed by space pressures and heat blast. Fine lads who start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone. Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more. But he closed his eyes. He stood there smelling the death odor in the hot air of the ship hearing the chug, chug, chug, the blood pumps down below. In his own heart, waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat. This is my last cargo rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't care much how I go back to earth. This venusian here. What's his name? Lefla. He's number 98. Shubmy into shelf 99 beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel. Rice was going to say something but he didn't have time. Lefla was alive. He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream. It didn't say anything. The heat blast in his white fingers did all the necessary talking. It didn't say anything either. But Burnett knew what language it would use if it had to. Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Two dead. Now I knew why. In voluntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lefla moved like a pale spider. Flipping his fragile arm to cover Burnett. The gun in it like a dead cold star. Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From the corners of his eyes he saw rice's expression go deep and tight, biting lines into his sharp face. Rice got it out finally. How'd you do it? He demanded bitterly. How'd you live in the void? It's impossible. The crazy thought came running down and exploded and Burnett's head. You never catch up with a war. But what if the war catches up with you? What in hell would Lefla be wanting aboard a more ship? Lefla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the chugging of blood pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the half-save a microscopic leaf in, criss-less, part-it transparently off of his face. He shucked it off, trellied air tendrils that had been inserted hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen. He spoke, triumph warmed his crystal thin voice. That's how I did it, Earthman. Glass-sides at rice, a face mold at mask of glass-site, leftly nodded, his milk blue eyes dilated. Very marvelously paratoo and unbreakable thickness of one-thirty of an inch, worn-honing on the head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and unfortunately viewed as you saw it outside the ship floating in the void, not discernible at all. Pricles a sweat appeared on rice's face, he swore at the Venution, and the Venution laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and quick. Burnett left too, ironically. First time in years, a man ever came aboard the constellation to live, it's a welcome change. Leftly showed his needle like teeth, I thought it might be, where's your radio? Go find it, snap-rice, hotly. I will. One hand blue-vained on the latter rungs, left the paused. I know you're weaponless, purple-cross regulations, and this airlock is safe, don't move. Whispering is naked feet padded wide up the ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed, metal and glass and coils, the radio. Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall metal, looking at his feet when he glanced up, rice's fresh animated face was spoiled by the new bitterness in it. Leftly came down like a breath of air on the rungs. He smiled, that's better, now we can talk. Rice said it slow. Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lefa, get out only dead men, belong here. Lefa's gun gripped tightened. More talk of that nature and only dead men there will be. He blinked, but first we must rescue career. Career, rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw. Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently. His eyes lit it, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama. Lefa's voice came next. Rather unfortunately, yes, he's still alive heading toward Venus at an orbital velocity of 2,000 miles per hour, where I one of these air krassala, enough air for two more hours, our flagship was attacked unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the lifeboats, scattering, create an eye in one, the other sacrificing their lives to cover arcscape. We were lucky, we got through the earth cordon unseen, but luck can't last forever. We saw your mortship an hour ago, to long long way to Venus. We were running out of fuel, food, water, radio was broken, capture was certain. You were coming our way, we took the chance, we set a small time bomb to destroy the life rocket and cast off, wearing our krassala helmets. It was the first time we ever tried using them to trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later. Rice's voice was sullen, a setup for you, huh? Traveling under the protection of the purple cross you can get your damned almighty safe to Venus. Left the bow slightly, who would suspect a morgue rocket of providing safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo? Pressious is the word for you, brother, Sid Rice. Enough left the move is gone several inches. A satellite towards Venus, mode detectors wide open, career must be picked up now, Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time in years, sure said Sam, smiling will pick him up. No tricks, Sid Lefa. Burnett's scallions smiled together. No tricks, you'll have career on board the constellation and half an hour or I'm no coroner. Follow me up be later. Left the dance stop, turned, wait is gone, come on. Burnett went up quick, almost as if he enjoyed doing Lefa a favor. Rice grumbled and cursed after him, on the way up Burnett thought about it, about Lefa poised like a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never knew whose body would come in for the star port next, number 98 was Lefa, number 99 would be career. There were two shelves numbered and empty, they should be filled, and what more proper than career and Lefa should fill them. But he chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing, and even then the cargo wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get 100, and you never knew who it would be. He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long legs over the whole room, stepped up, face Lefa and a cramp control room that was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio plates and visuals, kilometers clicking told at the steady dropping toward the sun at a slow pace. Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone, help career escape, seem safely divine and then be free. Sounded easy, wouldn't be hard, the nuisance weren't blind with malice, rice and he could come out alive if they cooperate it. But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves in the dim corridors of the long years, and their dead lips were stirring to life in Burnett's ears, not so easily could they be ignored. You may never catch up with a war again. The last trip. Yes, this could be it. Capture career and end the war, but what ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it. Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sagan is body banished as he taught him to spine, flex his lean, sinewed arms, what thin lips. Now, where do you want this crate? Yes, left the easily. Left the exhaled softly. Cooperation, I like it. Your wise, earthman. Very said Burnett. It was thinking about 3,000 eternal nights of young bodies being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of hating a job and hoping that someday they would be a last trip, and it would all be over. Burnett laughed through his nose, controls moved under his fingers like fluid, loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead, he squinted. There's your ruler now, Lepha, doing some assaults, looks dad a good trick. Cut power, we don't want to burn him. Burnett cut. Creators milky face floated dreamily into a visual screen. I sealed, lips gaping, hand sagging, clutching emtily at the stars. We're about 50 miles from him, catching up. Burnett turned to Lefzo with an intense scow. Funny, this was the first and the last time anybody would ever bore the constellation alive. His stomach went flat, putten with sudden weakening fear. If Priya could be captured, that meant the end of the war. The end of Shell's stacked with sleeping warriors. The end of this blind searching. Priya then had to be taken aborn. After that, Priya, the almighty, at whose behestal space had quivered like a smitten gong for part of his century. Priya revolving in his neat, water blue uniform, emblem shining gold, heat gun tucked in a glossy jet holster, with Priya aboard chances of overcoming him would be eliminated. Now, Rice and Burnett began to be left out. Lepha favored because of his gun. Priya would make odds impossible. Something had to be done before Priya came in. Lepha had to be young, tough, guard, shocked, bewildered, fooled, somehow, but how. Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on a shoulder blade where Lepha would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinu, artery, heart. There was a way, and there was a weapon, and the war would be over, and this would be the last trip. Swet covered his palms in a nervous smear. Steady Rice, he set matter of factly. With the rocket's cut, there was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in the center of that silence. Take control, Rice, all manipulate the star port. Burnett slipped from the control council. Rice replaced him grimly. Burnett strode to the next council of levers. That spot on his back kept aching like it was sheer branded X. For the place where the bullet sings and rips, and if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first, why. Criar Loom Bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of stars, his eyes flicked open behind the glass-eyed she and saw the constellation. Criar smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about to be rescued. Burnett smiled right back at him. What Criar didn't know was that he was about to end a ten years' war. And only one way of drawing Leather off guard and had to be fast. Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star port clashed open as it had done a thousand times before. But for the first time it was a good sound. And out of the star port at Sam Burnett's easily fingered directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies from space. Leather watched and tent and colded quiet. The gun was cold and quiet, too. The claw glided toward Criar without a sound now, dream-like in its fullness. It reached Criar. Burnett inhaled a deep breath. The metal claw cuttle Criar and its shiny palm. Leather watched. He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said, you know Leather, there's an old saying that only dead-mind-come aboard the constellation. I believe it. And the claw closed as Burnett spoke closely and certainly all around Criar crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There was blood running on the claw and the only recognizable part was the head which was carefully preserved for identification. That was the only way to draw Leather off guard. Burnett spun about and leaped. The horror on Leather's face didn't go away as he fired his gun. Rice came in fighting, too. But not before something like a red-hot ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back, I could drunk an idiot to fall in a corner. Fist made blunt flesh and noises. Leather went down, weaponless and screaming. Rice kicked and after a while Leather quit screaming. And the room swam around and Burnett's eyes and he closed them tight and started laughing. He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever claws come inside. In the starport grind shut. Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's young face over him. Burnett groaned. Rice said, Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have Sam. To hell with it Burnett once and fought to keep his eyes open. Something wet and sticky covered his chest. I said this was my last trip and I meant it. One way or the other I'd have to quit. This is the hard way. Maybe I don't know. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never have to come aboard the constellation though, Rice. His voice trail loft. You watch the shells fill up and you never know who'll be next. Who'd have thought four days ago? Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his mouth. He had a lot more words to say but only time to get a few of them out. Rice? Yes, Sam. We haven't got a full cargo boy. Full enough for me, sir. But still not full. We went back to center base without filling the shelves that wouldn't be right. Look there. Number 98 is Lefa. Number 99 is Creeer. Three thousand days of rolling this rocket and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who want to sleep easy. On the good green earth. Not right to be going back anyway but the way we're used to. His voice got all full of fog as thick as the fish of a dozen warriors. Rice was going away with him. Rice was standing still and Burnett was lying down, not moving but somehow Rice was going away a million miles. Eight-high one hell of a Patriot rice. Then everything got dark except Rice's face and that was starting to dissolve. 98 Lefa. 99 Creeer. You could still see Rice standing over him for a long time breathing out and then down under the tables the blood pumps pulsed and pulsed thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf at the far end of the room and then back at Burnett again and then he said softly 100.

Within the last few years there has been a reawakening of interest in the New Madrid earthquakes as evidenced by the papers of Dr. W. J. McGee in the fourth volume of the geological society of America. Dr. G. C. Broadhead in the American Geologist in August 1902 and Professor EM Shepherd in the January February number of the journal of geology of the present year. In Broadhead's paper are given abstracts of a considerable number of contemporaneous and other early publications on the earthquake phenomena. But the description by Audubans seems to have been overlooked. As he was one of the few quite possibly the only scientist who was in the region at the time, his count is of interest. It is of significance that it degrees very closely with the descriptions of many other residents, indicating that the accounts are probably not so distorted as has sometimes been thought. Audubans' description is in part as follows. Traveling through the barons of Kentucky in the month of November 1812, I was jogging on one afternoon when I remarked a sudden and strange darkness rising from the western horizon. The custom to our heavy storms of thunder and rain I took no more notice of it. As I thought the speed of my horse might enable me to get under shelter of the roof of an acquaintance who lived not for a distant before it should come up. I had proceeded about a mile when I heard what I imagined to be the distant rumbling of a violent tornado on which I spurred my steed with a wish to gallop as fast as possible to a place of shelter. But it would not do. The animal knew better than I was forthcoming. And instead of going faster so nearly stopped that I remarked to placed one foot after another on the ground with as much precaution as if walking on a smooth sheet of ice. I thought he had suddenly found her and speaking to him was on the point of dismounting and leading him when he all of a sudden fell a groaning pitiously hung his head, spread out his four legs as if to save himself from falling, instead stock still continuing to groan. I thought my horse was about to die and would have sprung from his back at a minute more elapsed, but at that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell and successive furrows like the ruffled waters of a lake and I became bewildered in my ideas as I too plainly discovered that all this awful commotion in nature was the result of an earthquake. The fearful convulsion however lasted only a few minutes and the heavens again brightened as quickly as they had become obscured. My horse brought his feet to their natural position, raised his head and galloped off as if loose and frallicking without a rider. Shocked to see that shock almost every day or night for several weeks, diminishing however so gradually as to dwindle away into mere vibrations of the earth. Strange to say I for one became so accustomed to the feeling as rather to enjoy the fierce manifesto by others. The earthquake produced more serious consequences in other places, near Nubitrit and for some distance on the Mississippi, the earth was runped a sunder in several places, one or two islands sunk forever and the inhabitants fled and dismay towards the eastern shore.

Short Science Fiction Collection 074,Various,56730,3.0,"December 23, 2020",[],0,"revox.org. Recording by James Jenkins. When Day is done by Arnold Castle. It was three and afternoon, in quitting time at Utopian appliances in corporate and termed J. Benard, the firm's stocky, thick-jallid president, waited to secretly at his desk for a few minutes, then closed the file he had been studying. It is Secretary of Pleasant evening and strode calmly out of the office. He did not want to appear eager and succeeded superbly on that. Joining several junior executives, he converged genuinely with them as they descended to the rapid transit floor. Three of the bright, confident young men to set to stop for a quick one at the building's plus soon. Well, that was okay. Bernard had been a late runner in his youth, but now, while in the middle of age, he'd learned that life had other demands and pleasures. Have a good run, BB, said Walkins, which was a treasure at the Rap-Trans Gate. Glorious coming in on the 330, and we're going to dinner and then some musical or others she's been dying to see. As Bernard entered the Rap-Trans-Alone, those surrounded by scores of pushing jabbering strangers, finding a seat on the aisle next to an electronics company vice president, whom he knew slightly. He engaged in trade conversation during the five minutes that took the Monterele to reach his stop. He and the electronics executive got off, as did about half the Rap-Trans passengers, mostly middle-aged men like himself, early runners. The escalator from the Monterele stop descended directly into the Jungle Station beneath. In the large lobby, the crowd disappeared, and Bernard was again alone, when he reached the dressing rooms. This was not surprising he reflected. Not many members of his Jungle Station could afford the elaborate private locker unique to this wing of the building. He pressed his thumb print to the lock and the door slid back. Inside he and dressed completely, noting with critical satisfaction, the strengthened color of his body in the full length mirror at one end of the locker. Luckily packed his clothes, shoes and briefcase into a small suitcase, with delivery instructions on the top. Then he climbed into a jungle suit. Nailing the shorts, sweatshirt, rubber-sold shoes, and hip holster. He checked a frequency setting on the sonic pistol, adjusting it to the panthers who were reported in the ascendancy. As a last thought, merely a o-m, he glanced down at the station emblem on his sweatshirt, just to enjoy the sense of pride he derived from the large red UF above it. Of course, there were getting to be more and more also freeze these days. But that did not make it any less of a matter of pride, in any way several factions were pressing to terminantly for a roses-free insignia. So there were complications there. Oh well, the important things to run, he remembered. In the lobby again, he deposited his suitcase at the delivery window. If any stopped at the building board to read the ascendancy rating for the day, these were official, therefore several days outdated. But one could extrapolate. Panthers were dropping into a third position behind polar bears, with giraffes at the top by a good margin. Outside the building, he ran into a tippeder, and decided he'd best buy a dope sheet. He gave the city a little man and dollar bill, and looked over the page. Even when he got it back, the man whispered horsely, nodding toward the pistol at Bernard's side. I got it straight. Dempanzers all over the place, watch out at the water holes specially. Clancing swiftly over the page, Bernard saw the 50 Panthers at interges sector of the jungle overnight, with a herd of 15 giraffes headed well toward the south. But he also noted there had been three deaths from polar bears in the past week in his sector alone. Fortunately, the frequency of re-adjustment from Panthers to polar bears was an easy one. Three clicks counterclockwise with the thumb. He'd have to remember about the water hole though, because he was at that or goal above the rapids. The sharks blow the rapids work pretty quick during the summer. Thanks buddy, told the tippeder. Tenny's droid still calm to the wall. Expertly he clambered up its handholds till he reached the top, 30 feet from the ground. On the other side lay the jungle. Its lush tropical growth, hiding from his alert eyes the danger that alerted within. He popped a verv pill into his mouth and chewed it thoughtfully. Far in the distance, some five miles at the narrowest point rose the outer wall. Between the two proud of variety of ambivalent robot beasts, now ready to dismember him. Bernard weakens adjusted to take small boys and girls for short rides or simply stock about picturesque. Trying his pistol and placing it between his teeth, Bernard leapt to the ground between the wall and the large low palm. At once the pistol was again in his hand, but nothing moved. Now he could see clearly the path he must take. Bending low he trotted along the undergrowth. It soon began to clear and still no danger inside. He holes through the pistol and advanced half-walking, half-running. But he could hear the hiss of the rapids. But he covered his own footsteps too. And Panthers were more phototropic than pull-a-verses. The latter having a preference for radar spotting. Coyotes were the worst of course. With their dam, infrared thermal sensors, take a spot of runner even when he was in cover. Fortunately they were scarce and getting more so. Bernard had only encountered a coyote twice. He activated it both times. But he had been lucky. He recalled the story about that city councilman. An hour later he arrived at the river, a half mile above the rapids and well-waifed from the waterhole. He had only seen one beast in the first three miles of his trek. A draft hobbling along an olfactory pursuit of another runner far to the right. Drafts were mainly in nuisance. Though they could kick and trample a man, Bernard had heard of such a thing happening, but it was a rarity. They were easy to elude. He crossed the river on a long raft he found, which had evidently been rigged to dump him in about half way across. At least he got that far on it, he told himself, as he struck out for the shore. For one horrible moment, he thought he detected a shark upstream. But it was merely the shadow of a large palm leaf. He had a strong and sensible fear of sharks. A mile-father found him crawling over the rocky ground as the crowds of Panthers reached his acute ears from behind a ridge of brush. If they heard him, they ignored him. Perhaps more interested in other quarry. His knees and arm forescraped, but not bleeding. And it last he was able to get to his feet to make better time. It was then that he heard the girl's scream. No regulations in the rulebook to discriminate against women becoming runners. But only a few of the millions who worked at offices some plants in the city did so. Also there was nothing in the code about helping other runners. Each was entirely on his own, free to help, or be helped, or not helped if he chose. Bernard would never have called for help himself. But the sound of the women's cry appealed to the other side of his nature. He changed his direction, but moved with great caution now. Soon he saw her and froze. She was glad as he, different sector emblem, but the same proudly born U.F. on her sweater. Her face and body were young and attractive. But her long dark hair was tangled in wet, and her limbs muds battered. She had screamed only once, and now her small lipstick miles hung open with terror. Back to Ginstitree, she gaped in horror, waiting his three panthers approached from his mini-directions. Her son, a clown, the ground outside the circle, was obvious that she was finished if Bernard did not assist her. Raising his hand till the pistol site was where he wanted it. He modified the angle adjustment to all of the animals were within its range. The need to press the trigger several times. To fill in the third animal leaped at the girl. But she twisted around the tree, and Bernard picked off the panther as it ready to self for a second spring. At once, the girl dived for her pistol. Proper response, Bernard thought, approvingly. Then she ran toward him and tore herself against him, breathing deeply in that position for several moments. Bernard felt strongly the strength and zest of youth as he held the girl in his arms. Then they turned and walked together to the outer wall, which was less than half a mile away. There was no danger from the deactivated panthers which would remain out of commission for half an hour, so they had no reason to hurry. Bernard helped her climb the wall, though she seemed quite adept at it herself. On the other side, the emerged upon the street. Across the street, by the acres and acres of homes, which were the city's eastern suburb. Oh, it was just horrible. The girl finally cried. All at once they sprang from nowhere. I tripped, and my sonic fell out of my holster. I'd be dead if it weren't for you. Very true, Bernard agreed. You'll be more careful in the future, I hope. If only I could thank you in some way, I owe you so much. My apartment is just up to next street. Only a few box. Wouldn't you like to stop in for a drink? I'm sure your tired is high. But Bernard declined. He walked her home, then continued on, unaware of the envious glances of young children as he passed, unaware of other runners, early runners, middle-aged men like himself, also walking the streets.

He was hungry. Also free and happy, he walked the last mile in contentment. The office was something that had happened long ago. What happened again tomorrow? Look at never-invades thoughts that night, and he knew exactly how his wife would create a metador. Hello, darling, how was the running? She asked. Kissing him as he came into the house. You only made fair time this evening, something happened? No, pretty routine. Panthers are on the increase. I came across three of them attacking a girl runner, works as a copywriter in the city. She claims that the jungle cured her ulcers completely, really remarkable. Hmm. Said Virginia taking his ulcer. A attractive note out, I suppose you tried to seduce you, I've heard stories about those jungle women. Nothing of the sort just suggested I drop in for a drink. After all she was grateful. What nonsense he told himself as he shoured, Virginia suggesting that the girl had intended to seduce him? Oh well, what difference did it make? Man, that hot water felt good. Even on his scratched legs and arms, how many years that he'd been making the run now? 23 almost. In a way he could consider himself a sort of pioneer. And I think the only reason he had started jungle running in the first place was to please a supervisor. These days everyone did it. I see, dried himself off, hearing the tinkle of cocktails in the living room. He wondered if the panthers would move south away from the waterhole before tomorrow's run.

He who would build both strong and high must first of all dig deep in low. So rose the spy against the sky, and so death's skill and knowledge grow. So with well-ordered, strenuousness, raised thou thy structure of success. Preface. It is popularly supposed that a greater prosperity for individuals or nations can only come through a political and social reconstruction. This cannot be true apart from the practice of the moral virtues and the individuals that comprise a nation. Better laws and social conditions will always follow a higher realization of morality among the individuals of a community. But no legal enactment can give prosperity to nay. It cannot prevent the ruin of a man or a nation that has become blacks and decadent in the pursuit and practice of virtue. The moral virtues are the foundation and support of prosperity as they are the soul of greatness. They endure forever and all the works of man, which endure, are built upon them without them there is neither strength, stability, or substantial reality, but only ephemeral dreams. To find moral principles is to have found prosperity, greatness truth, and is therefore to be strong, valiant, joyful, and free. James Allen. End of.

Recording by Kadastra, Dickens Children's Stories, retold by his granddaughter, Trotty Vekint is daughter Meg. Trotty seems a strange name for an old man, but it was given to Toby Vekint because of his always going at a trap to do his errands, for he was a porter and carried letters and messages for people who were in two greater hurry to send them by the post. He did not earn very much and had to be out in all weathers and all day long. But Toby was a fachirful disposition and looked on the bright side of everything. His greatest joy was his daughter Meg, who loved him dearly. One cold day, Toby had been trotting up and downed his usual place before the church, when the bells chimed 12 o'clock, which made Toby think of dinner. There's nothing he remarked, more regular and coming round than dinner time, and nothing less regular and coming round than dinner. That's the great difference between him. He went on talking to himself never noticing who was coming near to him. Why father, father, said a pleasant voice and Toby turned to find his daughter's sweet bright eyes close to his. Why pet said he kissing her, what's to do? I didn't expect you today, Meg. Neither did I expect to come father, said Meg smiling, but here I am and not alone, not alone. Why you don't need to say, observe trotty, looking curiously at the covered basket she carried, that you smell it, father dear, said Meg, only smell it and guess what it is. Toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket, why it's hot, he said, but to Meg's great delight he could not guess what it was that smelled so good. At last he exclaimed and triumph, why what am I thinking of? It's tripe and it was. Just as Toby was about to sit down to his dinner on the doorsteps of a big house close by, the chimes rang out again and Toby took off his hat and said, Amen. Amen to the bell's father? They broke in like a grace my dear, said trotty, they'd say a good one if they could, I'm sure. Men is the kind thing they say to me, how often have I heard them bells say, Toby back, Toby back, keep a good heart Toby, a million times, more. Well I never cried Meg. While Toby ate his unexpected dinner with a men's relish, Meg told him how her lover Richard, a young blacksmith, had brought his dinner to share with her, and had begged her to marry him on New Year's Day, the best and happiest day of the whole year. So went on Meg. I wanted to make this a sort of holiday to you, as well as a dear and happy day to me, father, and I made a little treat and brought it to surprise you. Just then, Richard himself came up to persuade Toby to agree to their plan, and almost at the same moment, a footman came out of the house and ordered them all off the steps, and some gentlemen came out who called up trotty and gave him a letter to carry. Toby trotted off to a very grand house, where he was told to take the letter into the gentleman. While he was waiting, he heard the letter read. It was from Alderman Cute to tell Sir Joseph Bally, that one of his tenants named Will Furn, who had come to London to try and get work, had been brought before him charged with sleeping in a shed, and asked if Sir Joseph wished him to be dealt leniently with or otherwise. To Toby's great disappointment, the answer was given that Will Furn might be sent to prison as a vagabond, though his only fault was poverty. On the way home, Toby ran against a man dressed like a countryman, carrying a fair, hair, little girl. The man asked him the way to Alderman Cute's house. It's impossible, cried Toby, that your name is Will Furn? That's my name, said the man. Thereupon Toby told him what he had just heard and said, don't go there. Poor Will told him how he could not make a living in the country, and that come to London with his orphaned niece to try and find a friend of her mother's, and to endeavor to get some work, and wishing Toby a happy new year, was about to trudge weirdly off again when Trotty caught his hand saying, stay, the new year can never be happy to me if I see the child and you go wandering away without a shelter for your heads. Come home with me, I'm a poor man living in a poor place, but I can give you lodging for one night and never miss it, and lifting up the pretty little one he trotted towards home, and rushing in he set the child down before his daughter. The little girl ran into her arms at once, while Trotty ran around the room saying, here we are and here we go, here Uncle Will come to the fire, Meg, my precious darling, where's the kettle? Here it is and here it goes, and it'll buy a no time. Why father said Meg, you're crazy tonight I think, poor little feet how cold they are. Oh, they're warmer now, exclaimed the child, they're quite warmer now. No, no, no said Meg. We haven't rubbed him half enough, and when they're done we'll brush out the damp hair, and we'll bring some color to the poor pale face with fresh water, and then we'll be so gay and brisk and happy. The child sobbing, clasped around the neck saying, oh Meg, oh dear Meg. Good gracious me, said Meg, presently, father's crazy. He's put the deer child's body on the kettle and hung the lid behind the door, Trotty hastily repaired this mistake, and went off to find some tea and a rassure of bacon he fancy he had seen lying somewhere on the stairs. He soon came back and made the tea, and before long they were all enjoying the meal. After tea, Meg took Lillian to bed, and Toby showed Will firm where he was to sleep. Then he went to sit by the fire and read his paper, and fell asleep to have a wonderful dream so terrible inside, that it was a great relief when he woke to find Meg sitting near him, putting some ribbons on her simple gown for her wedding, and looking so happy and young and blooming, that he jumped up to clasper in his arms. But somebody came rushing in between them crying, no, not even you. The first kiss of Meg in the new year is mine, Meg, my precious prize, a happy year. A life of happy years my darling life. Then in came Lillian and Will firm, and a band of music with a flock of neighbors burst into the room shouting, a happy new year, Meg, a happy wedding, many of them. And the drum stepped forward and said, Trotty, Beck, it's got about that your daughter is to be married tomorrow, and the rent is sold that knows you both that don't wish you both all the happiness the new year can bring. And till we are to play it in and dance it in accordingly, then Mrs. Chicken Stocker came in, a good humoried, commonly woman, who to the delight of all turned out to be the friend of Lillian's mother for whom Will firm had come to look, to wish Meg joy, and then the music struck up, and Trotty, making Meg and Richard second couple, let off Mrs. Chicken Stocker down the dance, and dance to dance to dance step on known before or since, found it on his own peculiar trot.

Here was one such a and, and he's told about a good deal and thought of a number of things. Here the sister, who was a child too and his constant companion. These two used to wander whole day longer. They wandered at the beauty of the flowers. They wandered at the hate and the blusiness of the sky. They wandered at the death of the bright water. They wandered at the goodness and the power of God, whom they deliberately wandered. They used to say to one another sometimes. Supposing all the children up on her to her to die. Who would the flowers and the water and the sky be sorry? They believed that they would be sorry. For, said they, the birds are the children of the flowers. And the little playful streams that gamble down the insights are the children of the water. And the moreless bright specs playing at the high and seek in the sky whole night, must surely be the children of the stars. And they would hold big leaves to see they playmates the children of men no more. There was one clear shining star that they used to come out in the sky before the rest. Near the church star above the graves. It was larger and more beautiful they told that all the others, and every night they watch for it standing and in and at the window. Whoever saw it for scray out, I see the star and opened the crowd out of it together. No, we saw well, what it would rise and wear. So they grew to be such friends who we did that before lying down in their bags. They always look out once again to be tea good night. And when they were turning around to sleep, they used to say, God bless the star. But while she was still very young, who, very, very young, this is their job and came to be so weak that she could no longer stand in the window at night. And then they tried to look suddenly out of it themselves. And when he saw the star, to round and said to the patient paid face on the bed, I see the star. And then his smile would come up on the face and they did the weak voice used to say, God bless my brother and the star. And so the time came all too soon. When the child looked out along and when there was no face on the bed, and when there was a little grave among the graves, not there before, and when the star made a long race down towards him, and this so he to throw his tears. Now, these rays were so bright and they seem to make such a shining way from her to heaven, that when the child went to his solitary bed, he dreamed about the star, and dreamed that the line was not used. He saw a train of people taking up the sparkling road by angels, and the star opening showed him a great word of light, where many more such angels waited to receive them. All these angels who were waiting, threw the beam in his eyes upon the people who were carrying up into the star. And some came out from the long rows in which they stood, and fell upon the people's necks, and kissed them eternally, and went away with them down avenues of light, and were so happy in their company that line in his bed, he went for joy. But there were many angels who did not go with them, and they mocked them one new. The patient faced that one said, they opened the bed, they was glorifying their agent, but he started to found out his sister among hold of host. He ceased to hang a lingering near the entrance on the star, and said to the leader among the two, who had brought the people to their. His brother come and he said, she was turning up a way, when the child stretched out his arms and cried, oh sister, I am here, take me, and then she turned her beaming high, and it was night, and the star was shining into the room, making long-race down towards him, and he saw it through his tears. From that hour forth, the child looked out upon the star, as on the home I was to go to, when that his time should come, and he told that he'd not belong to the herther on, but to the start to, because of his sister hangers so long before. There was a baby born to be a brother to the child, and while he was so little that he never yet has spoken to the word, his stretch is tiny form, out on his bed, and died. Again, the child didn't open star, and of the company of angels, and the train of people, and the row of angels with their weaming eyes, all to wrap up those people faces. Said this is the ringer to the leader, he's my brother come, and he said, now that one, but another. As the child, we had his brother's anger in the house, he cried, oh sister, I am here, take me, and she turned as my weaponim, and the star was shying. He grew to be a young man, and was busy at his books, and also her one came to him and said, time, other is no more, I bring her blessing on her dehring son. Again, at night he saw the star, and all of that former company, said this is the ringer to the leader, he's my brother come, and he said, time, other, and my recry of joy went for through all the star, because the mother was a unit to her to children, and his precious out his arms and cried, oh mother, sister and brother, I am here, take me, and they answered him, not yet, and the star was shying. He grew to be a man, who's hair was turning gray, and he was sitting in chair by the fire side, heavy with grief, and with his face be viewed with tears, when the star opened and once again, said this is the ringer to the leader, his brother come, and he said, now, but he's made in daughter, and the man would be in the child, so his daughter knew his lost to him, as she asked her, clear to the wrong, and he said, my daughter's head is on my sister's bottom, and her arm is around my mother's neck, and the doorfeeted there is a baby of my whole time, and I can build a parting from here, good be price, and the star was shying. Taz the child came to be an old man, and his wife's mood face was wrinkled, and his steps were as long and fliver, and his back was bent, and one night as I lay upon his bed, is children standing round, he cried, as he had cried so long ago, I see the star, they whispered one another, he's dying, and he said, I am, my age is falling from me like a garment, and they moved over the star as a child, and, oh my father, now I thank you that it has too soft, it would receive those dear ones who will wait me, and the star was shying, and they chined upon his grave, and the of a child's dream of a star by Charles Lincoln,",Short works,English,02:14:00,LibriVox Volunteers,[],"['Charles Lincoln', 'God']",[],[],0,0,0,0,2,0,0

An adventure in the fourth dimension by Farmsworth Wright. The thought of meteors terrifies me. They have a disagreeable habit of coming down and killing people at the most inopportune times. That is why I was so startled when I saw a large object hurtling toward me out of the sky, as I was walking along the lakefront recently in my city of Chicago. I shivered. This was the end. I began to say my prayers. To my astonishment, the on rushing missile struck the grass beside me, without the slightest jar. I gasped. Thousands of singular objects began to detach themselves. They bowed it from the mass and suddenly increased in size, from one inch to three feet in diameter. They were entirely round and covered with teeth. On each tooth were ten ears, constantly in motion. Each ear carried a quizzical eye. The dwarfish creatures rolled rapidly on the ground. The ears serving his legs, hands, tentacles, and whatnot, propelling them with incredible speed. Sometimes they stood on only four or five of their ears, then suddenly pressed hard against the ground, with a half a thousand ears at once, thus bounding high into the air. They lit without jar. For the ears acted as shock absorbers and broke their fall. Surely these are explorers from Mars or Venus, I thought, as the funny bounding creatures filled the air. You are wrong. They are jupiterion. Set a voice behind me. I recognized a voice. It was professored nut. You probably know him. He said, and what's more he repeated, Hum. Interesting of true, I remarked, and what might jupiterions be? They might be man, but they're not. He snapped. They are people from the planet Jupiter. Out of your interests, you thought they were Martians or Venusians. But you are wrong for Mars and Venus have people of three dimensions, like ourselves. Cupiterions are entirely different. There are 600,000 of them in this jupiterion airship. I was so overjoyed at finding someone who could tell me about them, that I didn't think to ask him how he knew all these startling facts. Where is the airship you speak of? I asked. There it is, he answered rather grand eloquently, and pointed to the empty spot on the grass. I looked carefully and made out of vast transparent globe, apparently of glass, which was rapidly becoming visible because of the Chicago dust that was settling upon it. I approached and touched it with my hand. It gave forth a metallic ring. Ah, left the professor. You thought it was glass, but it is made of jupiterion steel. Look out. I sprang back at his warning, and the last 100,000 left out of the globe, passing right through the transparent metal of which it was composed. No, the monomazelle, I explained in astonishment. This is a swear word I had learned in France when I was in the army. Now, I'm the monomazelle I repeated for I like to show off my knowledge of language. How can they pass through the glass without break again? Through the jupiterion steel, you mean, said professor Nutt severely? I told you before that it is not glass. Jupiterion steel has four dimensions, and they pass through the fourth dimension. That's why you can't see the metal for your eyes are only three-dimensional. Are the jupiterion people four-dimensional? I said, odd. Certainly said not rather irritably. Then how can I see them? I explained triumphantly. You see only three of their four dimensions, he replied. The other one is inside. I turned to look again at the jupiterions who now covered the whole waterfront. One of them sprang lightly, 50 feet into the air, extended a hundred ears like tentacles, and seized an English sporo. He crushed the sporo with some score or more of his teeth, which, as I have said, covered his whole body. In less than a minute, the poor bird was chewed to pieces. I looked closer and saw that the jupiterion had no mouth. No, no matter what Zell I explained for the third time, how can it get the bird into its stomach? Through the fourth dimension, said Professor Nutt, it was true that chute up pieces of the bird were suddenly tossed into the air, and the jupiterion sprang lightly after them. In mid-air, he turned inside out, caught the pieces of the bird in his stomach, and lit on the grass again, right side up with care. Did you see that? I exclaimed in a hush voice. Why can't I turn inside out that way? Because you are not four-dimensional. Reply the professor, a trace of annoyance in his voice. It is a beautiful thing to have four dimensions. He raps to die as, your jupiterion is your only true intellectual, for he alone can truly reflect. He turns his gaze in upon himself. And sees what he had for breakfast, I gasped, and one his neighbors had to. Your questions are childish, said the professor, weirdly. A jupiterion, of course, can look into the soul of things, and see what his neighbors had for breakfast, as you so vulgarly expressed it. But jupiterions turn their thoughts to higher things. The creatures now surrounded me. Their ears turned inward, as if they were sublocating. What do they want? I ask the professor. They want something to drink, he replied. They are appointing their ears toward their stomachs, to show that they are thirsty. Oh, I said, and pointed toward the lake. There is the fresh, cool water of the lake, if they are thirsty. Don't be fantastic, said professor, not. He isn't water they want. He turned his stern, pedulous gaze on my hip pocket. I turned pale, for it was my last pint. But I had to submit. If you have ever had professor nuts cold, accusing eyes on you, you will know just how I felt. I drew the flask for my pocket, and handed it to the chief jupiterion, who waggle his ears in joy. Immediately there was pandemonium, if you know what I mean. 10,000 times 10,000 ears seized the cork, and pulled it out in a resounding pop. One thirsty jupiterion passed right through the glass into the bottle in his eagerness to get at the contents, and nearly drowned for his pains. You see how useful it is to be for dimensional, remark the professor. You can get into any seller in the world merely by passing through the walls, and into any beer keg in the same way. But I argued, how did this, this insect, get through the glass into the whiskey bottle? The glass is only three dimensional, like everything else in this world. Don't call him an insect, not sharply reprimanded me. He is a jupiterion, and as such, he is infinitely superior to you and me. He passed through the glass because he is four dimensional, even though the glass isn't. If you had four dimensions, you could untie any dot by merely passing it through itself. You could turn inside out, or pass through yourself until your right hand became your left hand, and change into your own image as you flee it in the looking glass. Known, the madame wasel I exclaimed for the fourth time. A distant noise of barking was born to my ears by the breeze. All the dogs in the city seemed to have gone wild. They are disturbed by the talking of jupiterions, explaining the professor. It is too high pitch for cloth hopper human ears to hear, unless they have unusual range, but the dogs can hear it plainly. I listened, and finally made out a very shreal humming, higher than any sound I had ever heard before in my life, and infinitely sweet and piercing. Ah, I am hearing four dimensional sounds, I thought, aloud. Wrong as usual, excavated the professor with much heat. Sound has no dimensions. It proceeds in waves and bends back upon itself until it meets itself at an infinite distance from the starting point. There are three reasons you can't hear the music of the sears. First, because it has been away from the earth by the force of gravity as it passes the sun. Second, because your ears are not atoons as whole shreal are sound. And third, because there is no music of the sears. The first two reasons are really unnecessary in the light of the third, but a scientific mind, such as mine, is not content with one reason, when three can be adopted just as easily. Shades of Sir Oliver Lodge, I ejaculated. Sir Oliver is alive, the professor corrected me. A man does not become a shade until after his death. Then he becomes a four dimensional creature, like the Jupiterians, only different. No, the modem was l, I commented. Say something sensible, he reprimanded me. For the love of Einstein, how do you know all these things about the Jupiterians? I ask a sudden suspicion flashing across what I am pleased to call my mind. Einstein, yes, exclaimed not greatly pleased. My mother's father's name was Einstein. Then you are related to, no, I am not related, he interrupted. But my mother's father is, a sort of fourth dimensional relationship, I suppose. I replied sarcastically. At that moment, the air became vibrant with an invisible sound. The Jupiterians came rolling from all directions, as if they had suddenly heard the dinner bell. They bowed it through the Jupiterian steel of the globe, and immediately shrank its size from 3 feet to 1 inch. The Jupiterian assembly call just blue, explained the professor. Notice how the passengers draw into themselves. 600,000 are now packed into that globe. Our elevated railroads miss a great opportunity by not having four dimensional creatures to deal with. They pack us in just as tight, I venture to remark. The globe had begun to shoot into the air when their came from behind me a high pitch foil of distress. A shfriller and higher sound that had ever before been heard by human ears, so the professor assured me. The chief, Jupiterian, had been left behind. He, it was, who had passed into the whisky bottle. Not content with getting the lion's share of the contents, he had surrounded the bottle. In his pleasant four dimensional way, and now he could not get rid of it. Why does the new turn inside out and drop the bottle? I asked watching the Jupiterian with interest. Because your whisky has paralyzed him. Answer the professor. He is quite helpless. I looked at the globe, which had alighted again. Each Jupiterian suddenly resumed his full size in a brave attempt to bound to the assistance of his chief. But the creatures could no longer pass through the four dimensional metal of which the globe was composed. So thick a layer of Chicago dust had settled upon it, that to all intense and purposes it had become three-dimensional. The sudden impact of 600,000 bodies caused it to burst, with a roar as of a hundred peels of thunder exploding simultaneously. The air was filled with dead and dying Jupiterians. A dark cloud settled over the landscape, composed by the flying dust shaken from the Jupiterian glow by the explosion. Long streamers of electric fire shot from the fragments of the airship, and seemed to curve in upon themselves. Everything ran in curves, the darkness, the cloud, the sounds, the shaft of light, as if bent by the force of gravity. I put up my hands and fought the cloud that was settling down upon me. I seemed to be covered with falling feathers. When the cloud began to lift, I found myself in my own parlor. The air was full of flying leaves, which I was madly tearing from the book and throwing towards the ceiling. The book was a treatise on Einstein theory of space, which I had borrowed from a friend that afternoon. I had read nearly a page in it before I fell asleep. Only twelve men in the world understand the Einstein theory. It is said, if I had read the book, I would have been the 13th, and that would have been unlucky. So it is just as well that it is destroyed. But what excuse am I going to give my friend for tearing up his book? The end of, and adventure in the fourth dimension.

It was quite likely that at an earlier stage of the afternoon, the youthful and lively little company in the drawing room at Northover had been playing forphets or something equally childish. But when Mr. Rave Bentley, the owner of Northover, strolled along the terrace about half past five o'clock with a couple of companions. They were making music for a very pleasant tenor voice came floating through the windows, which, because it was a fine mid-march day, was slightly open. The voice was singing, since first I saw your face. And the middle-aged gentleman outside stopped to listen. How very tunful he got observed one of them. Who's the minstrel Bentley? How judging from the arse, I should say it is our captive friend, this subliath, responded the master of the house with a smile. So don't you think so, Rammit? And the son who's been some most glorious are, saying the voice, but the brow of the gentleman just addressed in no way resembled that luminary.

How but surely when should admire the Frenchman's enterprise objected the first speaker? And he sings the old song very well. How did he learn it? I wonder. How better ask him, searches, replied Mr. Bentley with a tunkel, as the end-seeing singer declared that where air he went he would leave his heart behind him, and a ploss greeted the end of the song. I'd almost ask you, Bentley, said Mr. Sturches, who had only that day arrived on a visit to north over. How what a French prisoner was doing, singing any kind of song in your house, having forgotten for the moment that one field was never per roll town. You have a good few of Boni's officers here, I expect. Now, only about 80, not nearly as many as it's redding or aweswestery. Bonfield is quite a small place, as you know. How 82 many remarked Mr. Ramich, who seemed possessed by a grievance. How they are a damn nuisance and banister, the agent, is too easy with him. How hardly a weak passes, but one of them breaks his parole, whereas up to some dirty trick or other. Well, come, come, Ramich, and deposed Mr. Bentley. You exaggerate my dear fellow. We've not really had a case since December 1812. So since last year, in fact, when that major of engineers took the key of the fields, as I believe he would call it, so we got clear off, too. Yes, and how, inquired Mr. Ramich, indignantly, the very weak he conservatively wore bristling with indignation. So disgraceful to say, with English assistance. How to sink with some people will do for money. That for the sake of gain, there should exist throughout the country a regular gang of escape agents who live by it as by a trade. How but I've got my eye on that man's saccharine, billor, peddler, poacher, and whatnot. And one day I shall catch him at his nefarious practices. How I am convinced that it was he who was the go between with major sushi, and those even greater scoundrels on the coast. Now saccharine Miller, inquired of fresh voice, proceeding from a tall, fair, handsome gentleman of about 30, would come unperceived along the terrace and join them. How would about saccharine Miller, how not poaching again, I hope, I had him up before me last month, and put him managed to prove an alibi. Mr. Ramich turned eagerly to the newcomer. Or not poaching, no, so Francis, I suspect him of something much worse. Only there, again, nothing can be proved against him. How Ramich thinks he's a sort of escape agent for the prisoners, Malhaland, supplied Mr. Bentley rather quizzically. And that is a somewhat more ambitious occupation than poaching. How a better paid one, anyhow, observed so Francis, Malhaland. If you would tell me what you know about saccharine Miller, Mr. Ramich, I should be greatly obliged to you, for I'm tired of finding him prowling in my woods for no apparent reason. But let us remove ourselves for the purpose, since I know that Mr. Bentley finds it hard to believe anything to the discredited of the French prisoners. How now, my dear fellow, protested as host, but so Francis, who the smile would seem to show that he was only justing, slipped his arm through that of the detractor of saccharine Miller. And they walked away, he inclinings his head to listen to the gesture emphasized disclosures of the smaller man. Now that is Malhaland, of Malhaland Park, I take it, observed Mr. Surgeist, who's friend. Why did not quite catch his name when you introduced us just now? I seem to remember that he had just succeeded his uncle in the estate when I visited you two years ago, but that he had not yet taken up his residence. The prospect, however, if I'm not mistaken, was then causing a considerable flutter among the young ladies of the district, and there my ma's. Mr. Bentley smiled, oh it was, and the flutter continued unabated until about three months ago, when he seized to be the very eligible party, at whom they were all setting their caps. Oh, seized, why? How because he became engaged, and the more to find thing to the fair of the neighborhood was, and that he laid Malhaland Park at the feet of no local aspirant after all, although, and this perhaps made it the more bitter, his chosen lady was staying at one field at the time in this house, in fact. Sir Francis Malhaland is betrothed to a very charming young lady, Mr. Julianne Forest, a school friend of my daughters. How Julianne Forest, a Lord Falgrave starter, though the same. She's one of the party in the drawing room now, before she has been staying with Mrs. Malhaland. Though she goes away the day after tomorrow, and then returns, I hope, to visit us here at Northover. How don't Fal and love with her, if you can help it, it's searches. I've fancy that, though he tries not to show it. Malhaland is infernally jealous. Now he could hardly be jealous of an old man of 60. And so, they met here at Northover. Oh, he was accepted last January under this very roof. To be exact, I believe, in the small room of the drawing room where I keep my Chinese porcelain. Mr. Sturgis looked away for a moment. Sir Francis and his companion had disappeared around the corner of the house. Oh, I should have thought, Bentley, he said slowly, how pardon and old friend won't you? And that, Malhaland and your own pretty girl. How had you never thought of them, Matt? Mr. Bentley showed a heart-free smile on his daughter's account. How litetia, my dear fellow, is going to marry her second cousin. And, how tried to believe that it is not a case of sour grapes. She does not greatly like Malhaland. Why can't think why? Or possibly because, well, you know what girlish friendships are. Yet, hers and Juliana seems as strong as ever. In fact, I sometimes wonder how Sir Francis likes his betroth spending his much time at Northover, as I'm glad to say she does. And what he said when he heard that she was going to pay us and not his mother a visit and April. Who were have ye in remage got to, I wonder? Also, quiet spot where they can discuss the chance of getting this Mr. Zachary Miller transported, I imagine. And what is transportation now? Is it not? For helping a prisoner of war to escape? That was since last year, yes. But I cannot say that so far, the fact has done much to deter escapes. Though I suppose it has raised their cost. Who it is a very surprising thing to me, this inability of the French to respect the parole of honor. My old royalist friend, the Compt, the Satsahsahsahsah, who has been an exile for 20 years and lived here for 12 of them, a science at all, of course, to the spirit which came in as a revolution. He says that the majority of these officers are destitute a like of breeding and a military tradition, so what can one expect? You have a Frenchman of the other party living here, exclaimed Mrs. Thurches with interest. Yes, of course, I remember him now. How do the two kinds mix? How about as well as oil and vinegar? The Compt ignores any bonapartist prisoner he may happen to meet. Young, disobliat, who was singing just now, is about the soul exception. And I think he tolerates him only because he is of good family and has a pleasing address. How it is a mercy that it is so, for Satsahsahsahsahsahsahs being such an old friend, and having the freedom of north over, he and Mr. Rao meet here for the often. How Mr. Rao, query his guest, and is the Bentley smiled. How the shot people and so on, who can't get the tongues around, Monsieur Rao will disobliat his family name, calling by that form of his Christian one. How is Mr. Rao the only one of the parole officers, who has the privilege of your hospitality? Oh no, I dare say there are about half a dozen others, but he is here the most frequently. A charming fellow, we all think him, even though he is an enemy. And when he was at large, I somehow fancy a pretty daring one, not that he ever talks of his exploits. He's a who's saw and was wounded and captured at Salamanca last summer. They took it turn up and down, someone was now playing the piano 40 with vigor. Oh that's Latisha, said her father. We might go in when she has finished her performance. Before we do, and before the patriotic Mr. Rao comes back, said Mr. Sturgis, taking his friend by the arm. Help tell me something, my dear Bentley. I presume that here, as elsewhere, the prisoners are strictly limited as the where they may go. One mile along the turnpike road from either confine of the town, being their boundary, hey? Mr. Bentley nodded, and well, my dear friend, when last I visited you, the first miles though. I distinctly remember the fact, instead of few yards to the left of your entrance gates, a between you and one field. Now it is a few yards on the right, as North of a shifted its position since 1811. How I understand that an earthquake-chair was felt last year in some parts of England. It wasn't an earthquake, Sturgis. I had the distance from the town remeasured, and it was found to be slightly incorrect. And as Mr. Sturgis laughed and shook his finger at him, the good gentleman added half apologetically. Oh, the poor devils have so few distractions. And as I'm a magistrate, and was actually deputy sheriff at the time of the correction, no one dared to say anything. Yet, some day, and here, Mr. Bentley lowered his voice and grandst over his shoulder. I have expected to find that ramages remeasured the distance yet again on his own account, and laid his discovery before another magistrate. Her mull Holland, perhaps. How curious, if you come to think of it, said Mr. Sturgis, reflectively. That all over England and Scotland, these French officers on parole, are living freely amongst us, and in many cases are received into our family circles. I want why not, asked Mr. Bentley. How they fought clean, every soldier from the peninsula says that. Well, let us go in. I fancy that literature is drawing to the close of that newest display of fireworks of hers, the siege of Badahos. If the actual event was really as noisy as that, I'm glad I was not there. It was a charming scene into which Mr. Bentley ushered the new arrival for the wide low room, whose last century tenses still survived in this 13th year of the new. Was brightened by groups in narrow, high-wasted gowns and sandals, and long-tailed blue or brown coat, and tight pantaloons and frills. The wereers of which, all young and all animated, seem to be enjoying themselves hugely. And now that the strains of Mr. Wesley's characteristics sonata no longer resounded, were making a good deal more noise than even the piano 40 had done. The tissue Bentley, a pretty fair girl in white and yellow, still sat at that instrument, but she was looking up and talking to another of her own sex. Leaning against the piano 40, and studying some music outspread upon it, was a young man of about 4 and 20, who caught the eye at once, by reason of his unlikeness to any of the other young man present. And that not so much by his good looks, as by his naturally more lively expression, his air of being able to set himself instantly in motion with a minimum of effort, like a well-trained runner or a deer. He was dark-haired, but fair-skinned, with a suggestion of sonburn that had survived captivity and winter. His little list thought, so slight that it was hardly more than a penciled line across his lip, like that of a steward gallant, left the firm bit sweet tempered mouth revealed. Yet, its mere presence sufficed to stamp him as not English. Of that, of course, is Mr. Brown said, Mrs. Sirge is to himself. The sound of the door opening had been drowned in chatter, but suddenly lit tissue caught sight of her father and rose quickly from the music stall. The young Frenchman, too, raised his head and saw him, and his face lit up with a very pleasant smile. There was a general course of exclamation, and Mr. Sirge's, welcomed a little shily by his host's daughter, was presented to all the ladies separately, and before long found himself engaged in converse, with her whose acquaintance had been specially promised him. Miss Juliana Forest. She was a tall, dark, handsome girl, with a beautifully modeled head on a long neck, an exquisite mouth, and an air of race. Her typical beauty, thought, missed the surges to himself, and was all the airs and graces of one, too, a warrant. But, as he chatted to her little, telling her how he had known her father had came, he found her not quite what he had looked to find, but more lively, natural, and open. More charming, in short, than he had surmised from his first glance at her. A little later, after he had been called away by Mr. Bentley to be presented to someone else, he perceived that the young French officer, who, however, was not in uniform, had gone up to her, where she sat in her long, slieved gown of lilac sarsinette, spotted with amber, on a small couch in a corner of the room. She looked beautiful and animated. His face, the observer, could not see. How making pretty speeches, of course, he reflected, her Frenchman's main idea of conversation with a woman. But, if he could have overheard, he would have discovered the chief subject of the little interview to be quite other. So, to my surferences, Moul-Halland, who, having just come in, was watching the couple unobserved from his place near the door. And so, you are leaving us on Saturday, but Moul-Halland was saying, yes, for about a month, Moul-Halland. But, I shall find you here, no doubt, when I return. Goal, disobliat, made a little face. My chance of being exchanged is so small that I fear you will. I'll pardon my ill manners. At any rate, I have something to look forward to. Your return, Moul-Halland. I must strive, must I not, that my English improved, I dare to hope, by the books which you and Ms. Bentley have been so kind as to lend me. It shall not fall away while you are absent. Your English is very good indeed, Monsieur, said, misforced, would lend the young Frenchman books in that tongue, just because, speaking and understanding it so well. Yet, past this childhood in England, he could appreciate them. That reminds me, how annoying. I didn't tend it before leaving Warnfield to lend you my copy of Rathalas, and to bring it here today, but I forgot. It is written, you know, in the most excellent style, you could not do better than study it. How I should be only too delighted, said Monsieur disobliat, with an inclination. But, alas, I cannot come and fetch it from Moul-Halland Park, since that is out of bounds. Oh, so it is, agreed, Mr. Giuliana. How have excatious? I must send the book then to your lodgings by one of the servants. You lodged with Ms. Hitchinx, I think. I'll put then I shall not be able to point out to you, my favorite passages as I designed. Oh, Missilla, said this along, exclaimed the perspective reader. How what is one to do? He could not, of course, suggest that she should accompany the book to his lodgings. The unerabled Giuliana pondered. She was a very high-spirited young lady, accustomed to having her own way, and equally unacoustened to having that way criticized. Much less controlled, as a certain person was trying to control it at present. Still, to inform a young foreigner, whom, after all, she did not know very well, that she purposeed coming to north over to Marl after noon, to take farewell of litisia Bentley, and to a prism of her homework route, in case he also should be taking a walk. No, even with so lottable and aim, as the personal bestival on him, of Dr. Johnson's model of style, it would not do. Well, I must mark the passages before I send Rasa to you, Monsieur de Subliac, was her conclusion, and Throol had hardly bowed his acquiescence before a deputation of young ladies was a punum, begging him to sing again. A French song this time, and by preference in new one, since he had sung them so very antiquated and English air, how have a new where he could have unerested? New, repeated the captain de Subliac, doubtfully. And may, check them as soon, how what do you think I've been these last three years to learn the new ditties of Paris? How did you never sing in Spain, then, Mr. Rau, half mischivously, inquired one damsel? Yes, hymns, replied her with entire gravity. But before the protesting laughter had subsided, he admitted. He had been, yes, I know one new song, at least it was new two years ago. I heard it first on the banks of the Kaya, Queen of Thens' ballot about Luzion et bou d'in-voix, and Pacton Boulaxi-Ti, in the time of the Cossats. I can play the air, Tom Piaque de Mal. Bowing to misforced, he went toward the piano forte, the little group following him with questions about the song and its writer. And Juliana Forest was left alone in a corner, on which, so Francis, Malhalland immediately stalked a cross tour, his face rather thunderous. But misforced, if she noticed any meteorological symptoms, did not betray her knowledge as she remarked evenly. There you are, Francis. Of there I've been for some time, returned her betrothed. I was waiting until he would disengaged. His tone was not exactly disagreeable, but neither was it the tone of mere zest. Juliana shot a little glance at him. That Francis was jealous, and sometimes insanely jealous, she had discovered about three days after her engagement. At first, the fact had amused her, but it had soon ceased to do so. But that was very unnecessary, she returned cheerfully. I, on my part, had been wondering where you were got to all this time. Or I did not observe any signs of solicitude. Have there really been any speculation in your mind? You could have seen me standing by the father door these five minutes or so. Of my dear Francis, returned the girl with a shade of impatience. How you surely do not desire to see me craning my neck in all directions to observe your wearabouts, every moment that I've not the pleasure of your society. I would not wish to make either of us ridiculous. And, as you are now happily arrived, and praise it down and listen to the new French song, which Missier Di Sabliag is about to sing to us. Sir Francis did not sit down. The word ridiculous had brought a slight colour to his cheek. I have no desire to hear French songs. I came to ask you to give me a few minutes private conversation in the Chinese room over there, for instance. A willingly replied Miss Forest, but the song is over. How was it? It is just going to begin. How pray Francis. Thank you, Mr. Ralph. See you at the piano four-day. And fidget and scowl, though Miss Forest's future Lord did, throughout the following three verses, he had to remain beside her. And the moment, however, that the last note was drowned in a ploss, he gave her a significant glance, and going to a neighboring door held it open for her. Unhorriedly, the unruble Juliana rose and passed through it, and to a little room containing an old spin it, one or two fine, clean and chairs, and much Chinese porcelain, mostly in present in cabinets. She turned on the young man as he shot the door behind them. So, this is the being interview, okay, Gly. We had another in here, once. And she smiled, a delightful, roguest smile calculated, one would have thought to dissipate the most obstinate male socks. But what is it that needs such solemn precautions, and that cannot be said when we go home presently in your caracol? When you forget the groom, reply to the French's rather shortly. He took the turn down the room, and then began to study a Fermi-Vacht vase on itself, while Miss Forest sinking into a chair, watched him half mistivously. Juliana, he said, at length, not looking at her. You may not like what I'm about to say to you, but I beg you to believe that I must say it. So, if it is a duty, then I certainly would not keep you from its performance, said Miss Forest, equally. A preproceed, or we may be interrupted before your task is accomplished. And thus, a jord, the gentleman turned from the porcelain and faced her. A desire, I request you, when you return to one field next month, to have nothing more to do with Captain Disapreya. The colors bring up in Juliana's cheeks, and her hands went to the short, walnut wood arms of her chair. And the reason, pray, because I do not like him, said so Francis, with brevity. Now, but if I do, while I must still ask you to apply to me in the matter, Juliana returned her hands to her lab. I find him intelligent, amusing, and well-bred, she announced calmly. What have you against him? Or he is a French prisoner, and what does one know of a French prisoner's antecedents? How Captain Disapreya is a gentleman? His name alone shows it, observed Miss Forest. Her name may not be his own. How then is bearing, his manners show it? Even that fact does not make him a suitable companion for a girl of your station, Juliana. A girl of my station, Francis, is accustomed to judge of that for herself. A pardon me, not in the case of a man to whom her future husband object. No, perhaps not. If the man in question were really a companion, admitted Miss Forest somewhat coldly. But look at the fact, Francis. I've seen very little more of Monsieur Disapreya, and that of any other prisoner at Warnfield. For indeed, Dislutish eventually, and not I, was at most of his society. I meet him occasionally at other houses, rather more often here, but always in company. As it happens, I've never spoken with him actually alone. How I should think not, indeed, comidits of Francis between his teeth. Miss Forest stopped and her discourse and looked at him. And if what, pray, would you be afraid if I were to find myself alone with a young man for a quarter of an hour or so? And do you realize, Francis, that you are making very strange and unflattering reflections on my character and upbringing? Her betrothed came nearer. How do not try to misinterpret me so, Juliana, he protested, and a voice of mingled injury and indignation. You know that I'm doing nothing of the kind, and the idea of your being alone without fellow for any length of time is outrageous. And do you not know what Frenchmen are? No, Sidness Forest, a sprite appeared in her eyes. But now that you have excited my curiosity, I think I should like to find out. How Juliana, she swept on, unheeding the explosion. But how a young man, even one of these terrible Frenchmen, conducts himself with a lady, depends chiefly, I imagine upon the lady. And do you think that I, she drew a prolonged neck and looked like Diana, that I am likely to allow any man to take liberties with me? How not for a moment, Juliana, not for a moment, a separated, the jealous lover. How but it is impossible to believe that a man exists, it would not try to make love to you if he had the chance. Which, completed Juliana, with a little smile, you do not intend that any man living, but yourself shall have. He stooped over her and possessed himself of a hand. How can you blame me? No, I do not intend it, and you, your beautiful creature, when you accepted this. He kissed the gleaming ruby on her finger. You ascended to that compact, did you not? Yes, so the girl, and I have kept my share of it. But in this matter of Monsieur de Savliag, how you will do what I ask, will you not, my darling, he broke in, and made a movement as though to kiss her. And Juliana slipped instantly out of the chair. And then she turned to him, and her look was grave. No, Francis, it is as useless trying to cagell me as it is to drag me. Day by day, this ridiculous and quiet, costless jealousy of yours is growing more in supportable. Now it is this man, now another, has soon as she'll be able to speak to none under the age of a grandfather, without incurring your friends. I've tried to be patient, but now I see that it is culpable in me to give way to you. That by doing so, I'm preparing a sort of slavery for myself. For I am an English woman, and you are not living in Turkey, as you sometimes appear to think. An attack so direct, plainly staggered, so Francis mull Holland. He seemed to be about to make a fiery retort, then he lost his balance and countered lately. So my wishes, my wishes, had no weight with you. Oh yes, certainly they have, for they are reasonable. But to forbid a perfectly innocent acquaintance, with a well-behaved and rather lonely young man, whom chance has thrown in my way. Helloantly, ejaculated her a fines, recovering himself, has that fore and nightingale in there, lonely, and chance indeed. Was the party took with you in those theatrical last month due to chance? Ms. Forest's gravity relaxed. No, to talent she retorted. As he happened to be the only young man in the neighborhood who did not look uncouth and absurd, disguised as a woman. Oh, his selection was due to you, and do not deny it. I was certainly not. I am proud to think that it was Monsieur Disabliak as the gypsy girl who was the success of the evening. I was specially in the scene with you. I watched you both Juliana. I hoped you did. I was told I looked very well as a woodcutter starter. Hello, if you had consented to act yourself as you were requested, Francis, you would not have been under the painful necessity of looking on, if it was painful. So Francis stifled some remark which sounded remarkably like a curse. How Juliana, for God's sake, dropped this levity, this trifling with a serious question. You are, she interrupted him firmly. You quite misapprehend, Francis. I'm not trifling, far from it. It is indeed a serious question. You are trying to impose on me a perfectly unreasonable demand. And leaving aside that it is unreasonable in itself. How do you suppose that when I come to stay in this house, I'm to avoid meeting a guest who frequents it as much as Monsieur Disabliak does. It's stay in my room by your orders, who are this dangerous foreigner as a mouse. Or ask Latisha to have him refused entrance and tell him why. He would have to be told, too, and might be flattered at your apprehensions, I imagine. So Francis, darkly red, was gripping the back of a chair. And Juliana, he said, sickly, are you trying to see how far you can go with me? No, answered she, her head very high. Only trying to show you how far you go, to lengths which three months ago, in this very room, we could neither of us have foreseen, I think. Mulholland's color suddenly faded, faded to real power. The words seemed to hold a veiled thread. But yet no opportunity a facetaining this, before, for the grudial of preliminary rattling, it is true. The door leading from the drawing room opened, and their host apologetically put his head in. Oh, I'm so sorry, but they are clamoring for you, Juliana, in there, and I could deny them no longer. Do not hate me, my dear. Juliana went to him and put her hand the risant. I think you come at a good moment, Mr Bentley, she said, and without a glance at her betrothed, entered the drawing room. But, is that gentleman instantly discovered, and the bone of contention was no longer fair?

The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,258464,78.0,"January 16, 2021",[],0,"x.org. The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald, chapter 1. In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had. He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. I habit that has opened up many curious natures to me, and also made me the victim of not a few veteran wars. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidence were unsought. Frequently I have fain's sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon. For the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and mired by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth. And after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from the east, last autumn, I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform, and at a sort of moral attention forever. I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction. Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes 10,000 miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperament. It was an extraordinary gift for hope. A romantic readiness, such as I have never found in any other person, and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No. Gatsby turned out all right at the end. It is what preyed on Gatsby. What foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams, that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men. My family have been prominent well to do people in this middle western city for three generations. The caroways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we are descended from the dukes of Buckloy. But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in 51, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the whole sail hardware business that my father carries on today. I never saw this great uncle, but I'm supposed to look like him, with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed to Tonic Migration, known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raids so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world, the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe, so I decided to go east and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I suppose it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, why yes, with very grave hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came east, permanently I thought, in the spring of 22. The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide-lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at 80 a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old dodge, and a finished woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast, and muttered finish wisdom to herself over the electric stove. It was lonely for a day or so, until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. How do you get to West Egg Village? He asked helplessly. I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, and original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood. And so, with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again, with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young, breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on myself in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only might us, and Morgan, and my seen-as-new. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary and college. One year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale news. And now I was going to bring back all such things into my life, and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This isn't just an epigram. Life is much more successfully looked at from a single window after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender, riotous island which extends itself to you east of New York, and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city, a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour, and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of saltwater in the western hemisphere. The great wet barnyard of Long Island sound. They are not perfect ovals. Like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end, but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the goals that fly overhead. To the wingless, a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular, except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the, well, the last fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre, and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only 50 yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for 12 or 15,000 a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. It was a factual imitation of some hotel de vue in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than 40 acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion, or rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby. It was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked. So I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires. All for $80 a month. Across the courtesy bay, the white palaces of fashionable, east egg, glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there, to have dinner with the tom Buchanan's. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I'd known Tom in college. And just after the war, I spent two days with them in Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven, a national figure in a way, one of those men who reached such an acute limited excellence at 21, that everything afterward savers of anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy, even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach, but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away. For instance, he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that. Why they came east? I don't know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully, wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it. I had no sight in today's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on for ever-seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game. And so it happened that on a warm, windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected. A cheerful, red and white, Georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun dials and brick walks and burning gardens. Finally when it reached the house, drifting up the side in bright vines, as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch. He had changed since his new haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw-haired man of 30, with a rather hard mouth and a super-silius manner. Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body. He seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage, a cruel body. His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked, and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts. Now don't think my opinion on these matters is final. He seemed to say, just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are. We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate, I always had the impression that he approved of me, and wanted me to like him with some harsh defiant, wistfulness of his own. We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. I've got a nice place here, he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly. Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore. It belonged to domain the oilman. He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. We'll go inside. We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosey colored space, fragily bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were a jar, and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside, that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room. Blue curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea. The only completely stationary object in the room was any enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering, as if they had just been blown back in after short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains, and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows, and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs, and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor. The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divine, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it, which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eye, she gave no hint of it. Indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring on apology for having disturbed her by coming in. The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise. She leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression, then she laughed, and absurd charming little laugh, and I laughed too, and came forward into the room. I am paralyzed with happiness. She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker. I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward her, and irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming. At any rate, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again. The object she was balancing had obviously taught her little and given her something of a fright. Again, a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her, found difficult to forget. A singing compulsion, a whispered listen. A promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since, and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour. I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east, and how it doesn't people had sent their love through me. Do they miss me? She cried ecstatically. The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a morning reef, and there's a persistent whale all night along the North Shore. How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom, tomorrow. Then she added irrelevantly. You ought to see the baby. I'd like to. She's asleep. She's three years old. Haven't you ever seen her? Never. Well, you ought to see her. She's Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder. What are you doing, Nick? I'm a bond man. Who with? I told him. Never heard of them. He remarked decisively. This annoyed me. You will. I answered shortly. You will, if you stay in the east. Oh, I'll stay in the east. Don't you worry. He said, glancing at Daisy, and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. I'd be a goddamn fool to live anywhere else. At this point, Miss Baker said, absolutely. With such suddenness that I started, it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yonned, and with a series of rapid, deaf movements stood up into the room. I'm stiff, she complained. I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember. Don't look at me, Daisy retorted. I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon. No thanks, said Miss Baker, to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. I'm absolutely in training. Her host looked at her incredulously. You are. He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. How you ever get anything done is beyond me. I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she got done. I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small, rested girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her gray, sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite, reciprocal curiosity, out of a wand charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her somewhere before. You live in West Egg, she remarked contemptuously. I know somebody there. I don't know a single. You must know Gatsby. Gatsby demanded Daisy. What Gatsby? Before I could reply that he was my neighbor, dinner was announced. Wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room, as though he were moving a checker to another square. Slanderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. Why candles objected Daisy, frowning? She snapped them out with her fingers. In two weeks, it'll be the longest day in the year. She looked at us all radiantly. Do you always watch for the longest day of the year, and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year, and then miss it. We ought to plan something, y'all and miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. All right, said Daisy. What'll we plan? She turned to me helplessly. What do people plan? Before I could answer, her eyes fastened with an odd expression on her little finger. Look, she complained. I heard it. We all looked. The knuckle was black and blue. You did it, Tom. She said it queuesingly. I know you didn't mean to, but you did do it. That's what I get from marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking, physical specimen of a... I hate that word, hulking, objected Tom, crossly, even in kidding. Hulking insisted Daisy. Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively, and with a bantering in consequence that was never quite chatter. That was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over, and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its clothes, and a continually disappointed anticipation, or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself. You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy. I confessed on my second glass of quirky, but rather impressive clarit. Can't you talk about crocks or something? I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way. Civilizations going to pieces broke out Tom violently. I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read the rise of the colored empires by this man Goddard? Why no? I answered, rather surprised by his tone. Well, it's a fine book and everybody ought to read it. The idea is, if we don't look out, the white race will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff. It's been proved. Tom's getting very profound, said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we? Well, these books are all scientific, insisted Tom, clancing at her impatiently. This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are that dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things. We've got to beat them down, whispered Daisy, winking for rociously, toward the fervent sun. You ought to live in California, began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair. This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and after an infinitesimal hesitation, he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. And we've produced all the things that go to make civilization. O science and art and all that. Do you see there was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more acute than a old, was not enough to him anymore. When almost immediately the telephone rang inside, and the butler left the porch, Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me. I tell you a family secret she whispered enthusiastically. It's about the butlers' nose. Do you want to hear about the butlers' nose? That's why I came over tonight. Well, he wasn't always a butler. He used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for 200 people. He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose. Things went from bad to worse, suggested Miss Baker. Yes, things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position. For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face. Her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened. Then the glow faded, each light desertting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear. Whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing. I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose, doesn't he? She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation. An absolute rose? This was untrue. I am not even fathily like a rose. She was only ex-temporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house. Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance can spikulously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said, shh, in a warning voice. A subdued, impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether. This Mr. Gatsby used spoke of his my neighbor, I said, don't talk. I want to hear what happens. Is something happening? I inquired innocently. You mean to say you don't know, said Miss Baker, honestly surprised? I thought everybody knew. I don't. Why? She said hesitantly. Tom's got some woman in New York. Got some woman, I repeated blankly. Miss Baker nodded. She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don't you think? Almost before I had grasped her meaning, there was the flutter of address and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table. It couldn't be helped, cried Daisy with tense gaity. She sat down, glanced, searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued. I looked outdoors for a minute, and it's very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a night in gale, come over on the canard, or white starline. He's singing away. Her voice sank. It's romantic, isn't it, Tom? Very romantic. He said, and then miserably to me. If it's light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables. The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom, the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table, I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hearty skepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament, the situation might have seemed intriguing. My own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police. The horses needless to say we're not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting Veranda's to the porch in front. In its deep gloom, we sat down side by side on a wicker setty. Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. We don't know each other very well, Nick. She said suddenly, even if we are cousins, you didn't come to my wedding. I wasn't back from the war. That's true. She hesitated. Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about everything. Evidently, she had reason to be. I waited, but she didn't say any more, and after a moment, I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. I suppose she talks and eats and everything. Oh yes, she looked at me absolutely. Listen, Nick, let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear? Very much. It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about things. Well, she was less than an hour old, and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and whipped. All right, I said, I'm glad it's a girl, and I hope she'll be a fool. That's the best thing a girl can be in this world. A beautiful little fool. You see, I think everything's terrible anyhow. She went on in a convinced way. Everybody thinks so. The most advanced people, and I know I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything. Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. Suffisticated. God, I'm sophisticated. The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention. My belief. I felt the basic insincereity of what she had said. It made me uneasy. As though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face. As if she had asserted her membership and a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged. Inside, the crimson room loomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch, and she read aloud to him from the Saturday evening post. The words murmur us and uninflicted, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight bright on his boots, and dull on the autumn leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms. When we came in, she held a silent for a moment with a lifted hand. To be continued, she said, tossing the magazine on the table. In our very next issue, her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up. Ten o'clock, she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. Time for this good girl to go to bed. Jordan's going to play an tournament tomorrow. Explain Daisy. Over at Westchester. Oh, your Jordan Baker! I knew now why her face was familiar. Its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotographier pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago. Good night, she said, softly, wake me at eight won't you? If you'll get up, I will. Good night, Mr. Caraway. See you a non. Of course you will, confirmed Daisy. In fact, I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of, oh, fling you together. You know, lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to see in a boat and all that sort of thing. Good night, called Miss Baker from the stairs. I haven't heard a word. She was a nice girl, said Tom, after a moment. They oughtn't to let her run around the country this way. Who oughtn't to inquire Daisy coldly? Her family. Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's going to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her. Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence. If she from New York, I asked quickly. From Louisville, our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda, demanded Tom suddenly? Did I? She looked at me. I can't seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know. Don't believe everything you hear, Nick, he advised me. I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor, Daisy, perempturally called wait. I forgot to ask you something and it's important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out west. That's right, corroborated Tom kindly. We heard that you were engaged. It's liable. I'm too poor. But we heard it insist a Daisy surprising me by opening up again in a flower like way. We heard it from three people, so it must be true. Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the bands was one of the reasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on account of rumors, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage. Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich. Nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms, but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he had some woman in New York was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egoism no longer nourished his perimptary heart. Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs sent in front of waste-eyed garages where new red gas pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg, I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off leaving a loud bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat waved across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone. Fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion, and was standing with his hands in his pockets, regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and secure a position of his feet upon the lawn, suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself. Come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens. I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him, for he gave a sudden intemation that he was content to be alone. He stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. In voluntarily I glanced seward, and distinguished nothing except a single green light, my mute and far away that might have been at the end of a dock. When I looked one small for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.

Great Appalachian Trail from New Hampshire to the Carolinas. From the New York Times February 18, 1923. The Appalachian Trail is a proposed walking or hiking trail to extend through the length of the crest line of the Appalachian Chain of Mountains from Maine to Georgia from Northward of Mount Washington in the New Hampshire White Mountains to Southward of Mount Mitchell in the Carolinas Highland. The project is one in regional planning. It is being promoted by the American Institute of Architects through its committee on community planning of which Clarence S. Stein is chairman. The project was first proposed by the President Author in the Institute's Journal for October 1921. It was discussed in detail at the New York and New Jersey Trail Conference held in New York last Friday. And if things come to pass as the promoters dare to hope, the building of this trail will be merely the first step in the building of a People's Appalachian Empire. And what excuse do we give for our Imperial designs? Why the same old excuse? The outlet of surplus population, perhaps so. The east sides of our cities would suggest the obvious need for highways of expansion. Or is it outlet of surplus sole which we require? The call of the frontier that twilight zone between what is and what may be lies deep within us. It is a pent-up volcanic force in every human being. It cries aloud for work and so it heats the drum beat. It cries for play and so it seeks the dance hall. If surplus population surplus body demands its outlet, so to surplus sole. The flowers that bloom in the spring trowel have something to do with the case. The outlet which we crave is the one they have attained to be out in the sun. We would build a place there. Here is the work we crave to build for ourselves on the frontier a better, a wider place in which to live a wider life. But how so we approach this stupidest job? Is there some key to our Imperial ambition? Geographically speaking, yes. The key to Empire is transportation. The railway is the big steel key to a country's industrial development. Its ancient forrunner, the footpath, is the key to a country's recreational development. Our immediate empire is recreational. Our Imperial dream therefore takes immediate tangible form in the transportation project. An American hinterland. The Appalachian Trail would traverse from north to south from end to end, the back country of the Atlantic border. The hinterland formed by the Appalachian Range. Other mountainous hinterlands are offered by America, such as the Rocky Mountain and the Cordil Yerenne. But the Appalachian more than the others is of national significance. For it penetrates the populist portion of the nation. In climate resources, peoples, it epitomizes in large degree the American continent. Its area would cut a big slice from the empire of ancient Rome or from that of modern Germany. The gist of empire making for the purposes of hand is the care of the countryside. Herein lies the basis of true patriotism. Why the cry of my country and not my city or my government? Because these others come and go, but our country stands eternal. It is our common ground in footing. So the biggest material conception which a people is called upon to make is a geographic one. Patria is country and patriotism is countryism. We hear little of the latter except in time of war. But if our countries were fighting for in times of war, why is it not worth caring for in times of peace? War patriotism has been advertised, but every day patriotism has not. Every day patriotism, the care of the country is the fundamental principle of empire making for the people. Forest fire protection. The first care of our country as the first care of our city or our home is to keep it from burning up which means in this case forest fire protection. For the abolition country in most part is a forest country. The forest is or will be the main resource. The picturesque grazing industry, both of cattle and sheep, has great possibilities throughout the abolition range. Once a thriving occupation, there are coming signs of its return. But grazing in the upland pastures and agriculture in the bottom valleys will by and large be secondary to the great future industry of forestry. So the very first care of the abolition country is that a forest fire protection. And in order that the abolition trail and the folk that use it may from the first become an asset and not a liability in such protection, the trail system must be conceived also as a fire system. And this is very simple because the basis of any scheme of forest fire protection consists of forest trails or roads. The first thing needed in forest fire fighting is accessibility. The means of reaching the fire. trails should run along the crest lines and roads along the valleys. These to be connected every little way by counterroads or trails up and down the slopes. The next thing is fire apparatus, picks and shovels and perhaps extinguishers, cached and big boxes at convenient points along the ways. Having tools in a clear way, all that is needed next is men. Petrolers stationed at strategic lookout points equipped with map, field glass and telephone, of the alarm when smoke is first sighted. They call up the local fire warden who lives in the valley or nearby town. He then calls his men together, the firefighters paid or voluntary, who hold themselves ready to run and go at the dock of the hat. Fire systems of this sort are kept up by the United States Forest Service on all the national forests, several of which are in the Appalachian Mountains. They are also maintained by the various states. Part of the organization of the Appalachian Trail would consist of unifying and extending these forest fire services. This would enlarge and correlate the forest fire prevention work now being developed in cooperation with the various forest officials of state and nation. If fire is the first enemy of the forest country, devastation is the second. But forest devastation is our present American practice. We cut down the forest three times faster than they grow. We treat the forest not as a crop of wood, but as a deposit of wood. And just as we mine the coal deposits below ground, so do we mine the wood deposits above ground. We shovel out the coal and leave the coal mine empty. And we shovel out the timber and leave the forest valley empty. Empty of timber and of a timber industry. Empty of workers and of population. The opposite of forest mining is forest culture or forestry. This cuts from the forest valley each year only as much timber as grows there each year. So the valley never becomes empty of timber, industry, or folks. Forest culture therefore is a big principle in empire making. It would restore to the country not only the forest but the folks. Many in Appalachian Hilltown has fewer families today than 100 years ago. It has been wrecked through forest mining. It can be restored through forest culture. The might be empire of the Appalachian country is a land of hidden treasure. Millions of acres await reclamation. Not alone for timber raising, but for sheep and cattle raising. For grazing on the hillside and for farming in the valleys. Whole valleys remain empty which might be alive with thriving communities. The reclamation dust of millions of acres would mean the restoration of thousands of homes. When the approach to a restored east is a continuous highway, as the Oberland Trail was the approach to the opening west. So much for possibilities and aspirations, but empire was ever an elusive dream. How shall we bring it all about? What are the possibilities for making a start and who shall take the lead? For one thing the job should not be left wholly to technicians. The forester, the engineer, the architect, the landscape architect, the agriculturalist, each has his big part in this development. But there is something even bigger. For without the will to do which comes from the people at large, the technicians hands are tight. The amateur, as a representative of the people, is needed quite as much as the technician. He is needed not to look on, but to take part, to take his hand in plan and survey. And if he goes astray, the expert can correct. The professional should guide, but the amateur should do. Connect old roots. The first step is to study the work already accomplished. For hundreds of miles the path is already made for us. Mountain and forest trails of one sort or another riddle the appellation ranges. In large part therefore, to make the trail will consist of choosing which path to take. Training plans are being made along the range to show which paths are best. And of course, a lot of cutting will have to be done. Trail cutting is an old story to the trail fans in various eastern sections. In New England, 2008 miles of through trails have now been cut. This mileage is less than that of the whole appellation trail as projected from New Hampshire to Georgia. The expense of these trails is borne by each local organization. The idea of the Appellation Trail is merely to get people to unify their paths along one big line instead of leaving them to run shelter-scelter. And they seem to like the idea. Scouting on the projected line of the Appellation Trail made unexpected progress during the last summer in sections from New England to Virginia. There are of course, a thousand in one practical difficulties to be overcome. An important one is the matter of getting permission to cross private lands. For several hundred miles, the trail will be on public land, state, or national. And here the problem is solved. On private property, experience has shown that through proper approach and understanding permission is usually granted. There are exceptions of course, and certain lands may have to be detoured. The chief reason for refusal is fear of forest fires. It is a reasonable fear, and the answer to it is preparation of the kind described to make the trail a factor of fire protection. The end in view is to open up a realm. To do this requires the development gradually by purchase under the weaks law of more national forests. We should have indeed won big national forest, a super national forest, covering the Appellation Country from end to end. This does not mean that all the forest in mountain lands should literally be in federal ownership. Much might be state or town owned. But enough should be in public hands to make of the Appellation Region a national or people's sphere of influence. Here and a word is our campaign. To attain the first two mighty steps toward Empire, one transportation and two sphere of influence, an Appellation Trail and a super national forest. And the Empire of our ambition is the realm of the crestsline. This is something more than a geographical location. It is an environment. It is the environment, not a road and hotel, but a trail in camp. It is human access to the sources of life. And in this access, the camp is as vital as the trail. We cannot truly live within our Empire unless we provide for night as well as day. The trail which provides alone for going does not wholly function unless it have its wayside shelter camp it fails to give full access to the country. Underworld and overworld. And the camp which provides alone for shelter does not wholly function. It may give access to the country, but that is only half of the potential power of our realm. Under proper guidance and protection, the recreational power of the days walk on the trail could be doubled by the evening spent in camp. Here in Lysaccess not only to the country, but to a whole new social life. Down here in the cities where most of us now live, we have a social life of many patterns. Please go by numerous names such as the club life and the cafe life and the tennement life and whatnot. And we refer to the lot of some of our less fortunate neighbors as the life of the underworld. But in a sense, however respectable our lives may be, the life of all of us, folk down here, beneath the mountain basis, is a life of the underworld. Hence the obvious need to develop above these mountain bases up in the realm of the crest line, a life of a different straddle, a life of the overworld. Thus, Shadar guide boards read, it will be a long, long path, and the Appalachian Trail is only the first link. But it makes a start. The scouting of this trail on the fields to which it leads is something to make for immediate fun, as well as ultimate welfare. Something to stimulate in the public mind, a clean cut vision of constructive national development as against a fog of economic vagaries, something to serve as a constructive outlet for the high-powered spirit of youth, not to absorb energy but to attain a goal, the goal of empire, a better deal, a place in the sun, such as the outlet sought through the Appalachian Trail.

It is a simple matter to dematerialize a body by cremation. In this case, a man locks a good healthy girl in a back vault for two hours and tries to center soul into the infinite with the aid of soft music instead of fire. Dematerialization by C Mason. A fair young thing with tender blue eyes and her woodworth office and calmly seated herself. A glance at her portfolio empelmed him to seek refuge in the cool brick vault of his neighbor across the passage barker who called himself a banker. But the lady barred the way. Now he said desperately without waiting to be interrogated. I don't want to subscribe for a history of the war nor the lives of the candidates nor picturesque anything. But honored sir replied the mild simple and rather simple and young person. I do not ask you to subscribe for anything unless indeed you would honor me by taking a ticket. Take it nothing again interrupted woodworth. I have no leisure for emusments. My time is all taken up with my profession and science. Ah, that's what drew me hither. Be him the beautiful girl. I proceed by your sign that you are a lawyer and I have heard that you are a member of prominent one of the Psychicol Research Society. In one or both capacities I think you can do me an inestable service. Woodworth touched at the two vulnerable points unbent. You see, kind sir, she continued, I am a materialized spirit. My manager, Mr. Schocten, who is stopping at the hotel, here is his card, called me forth from the spirit world by mistake for Martha Washington. With whom I was contemporaneous. Woodworth had noticed the antique style and courtly bearing of his visitor. He delayed so long in endeavoring to correct his error she went on that instead of remaining in the misty, indistinct form in which spirits are preferably presented, I became as thoroughly substantial as when I was before on earth, one hundred and forty six years ago. Upon my word young lady or venerable Dame, the lawyer corrected with wholet in courtesy. This is a very extraordinary statement. Do you not know that you render yourself liable for prosecution for obtaining money under false pretenses when you attempt to sell a ticket on such a tale as that? She smiled trustingly. No sir, I do not know that. Indeed, I am only beginning to learn the strange things of your wonderful century, but I like them very much. Through my familiarity with the disdap and spindle, the needle and quill pan will no longer afford me a livelihood. I have an ardent longing to learn the sewing machine or the typewriter and become a new woman. I am most anxious to resume the life prematurely cut short in 1770 in my 18th year when I died for I'm what was erroneously diagnosed as a Quincy. I have reason to believe that had I been properly treated for diphtheria with an anti-toxin serum. I should have lived to a good old age. What is there to prevent you from doing so now? Ask Woodworth touched and interested immeasurably by his singular client. Because my master, for so I must call him, Mr. Shaktin, who brought me from the other world is determined to send me back. I heard that from mercenary motives, he means to dematerialize me at his very next saience. Woodworth hurried through all the known legal processes, but neither habeas corpus, ni extent, nor any other rip with which he was familiar, seemed a remedy against the peculiar form of extradition proposed by Shaktin. Putting on his hat he exclaimed, you sit right there while I interview this tyrant, Miss Amy all right was my name before she answered sweetly. Finding the spiritual manager in his improvised office at the hotel, the lawyer addressed him by name saying, I warn you to desist from your persecution of my client. Miss Amy all right. She is perfectly satisfied with this mundane sphere as the reporters call it and intends to remain here. I shall take steps to adjoin you from making her the subject of further experimentation. Take a ticket with Shaktin's corgal response, thrusting out a card. One dollar please, 730 this evening. We are going to dematerialize that shit this very night. And if it doesn't come off, call me all the liars you will. Next, one moment, Mr. Shaktin said, woodworth severely, I understand you to say that you intend to dematerialize, which I suppose means to disembodied, to cause to disappear. Into thin air evaporate, van moose, answer the medium in a business like tone. Cause to disappear a person now living, that my dears her is murdered. Wrong, replied Shaktin, who is this girl, where does she hail from? She's been dead, 146 years. Can't kill a person twice, you know? What good is she anyway? She's way behind the times. Can't even sell a ticket to her own dematerialization. Then you are determined to dematerialize the lady again, demanded woodworth somewhat demoralized. Sure, come and see for yourself. Take a ticket and one for your wife. I shall certainly come with the police. You insist on making this preposterous experiment. Fact, but tell you what I'll do. You may take the young woman, lock her up, do anything you like with her, and I'll bet you a cool hundred, I'll dematerialize her all the same. Woodworth clutched at this proposition. He began to see a way out. The Psychicol Research Society was hastily summoned in special session, and Amy Allwright was introduced to President Barker and the members. Her friendess and timidity convinced the most skeptical among them that she, at least, was innocent of collusion with the medium. She appeared terribly to dread the threats of Shaktin. Oh, gentlemen, she pleaded, put me underground, put me in some strong place where will be impossible to get at me? I am so tired of being a spirit. Don't let me be dematerialized again. Provided with a lunch from the hotel wrapped in a napkin, she was smuggled into Barker's bank. It was dignified by that name and the village, and locked into its roomy old brick vault, and a committee signed an affidavit to that effect. Then all the Psychicol people attended Shaktin's sayons. It was very long and very mysterious. For two hours the audience, they could not be called spectators, sat in darkness, listening to soft music, and waiting for Amy Allwright to appear. At last, there came a gentle tapping. Aha, explain, Shaktin. She comes. Who goes there? The spirit of mistress, Amy Allwright, who died of Quincy in 1770, are you in the flesh or in the spirit? A spirit, a last? Oh, what was me? There you are, gentlemen, said Shaktin, switching on the lights. Now produce your Amy, if you can. The audience, led by the Psychicol Research Committee, troop back to Barker's bank. Heavens, the man had what is bet. Amy had dematerialized after all. So had the contents of the bank. The only material evidence remaining of the Gile Skirl and her work there were the crumbs of her luncheon. The napkin in which it had been wrapped. And a hotel table knife snapped short off, which had served as a screwdriver. The big old-style locks with their screws lay on the floor.

She was company and one could talk to her. I can't tell anyone about it. In the first place, they'd never believe me. And if they did, I'd probably be punished for having her, because we aren't allowed to have pets of any kind. It wouldn't have happened if they hadn't sent me way out there to work, but you see there are so many things I can't do. I remember the day the chief of vocation took me before the council. I've tried him on a dozen things he reported. People always talk about me as if I can't understand what they mean, but I'm really not that dumb. There doesn't seem to be a thing he can do that you've went on. Actually, his intelligence seems to be no greater than that which we believe our ancestors had. Back in the 20th century, as bad as that, observed one of the council members, you do have the problem. But we must find something for him to do, said another. We can't have an idle person in the state. It's unthinkable. But what asked the chief, he's utterly incapable of running any of the machines. I've tried to teach him. The only things he can do are already being done much better by robots. There was a silence broken at last by one little old council member. I have it he cried, the very thing, who make him guard of the treasure. But there's no need of a guard, no one will touch the treasure without permission. We haven't had a dishonest person in the state for more than 3,000 years. That's it. Exactly. There aren't any dishonest people, so there won't be anything for him to do. But we will have solved the problem of his idleness. It might be a solution so the chief, at least a temporary one. I suppose we will have to find something else later on, but this will give us time to look for something. So I became guard of the treasure, with a badge, and nothing to do unless you count watching the key. The gates were kept locked, just as they were in the old days, but the large key hung beside them. Of course, no one wanted to bother carrying it around. It was too heavy. The only ones who ever used it, anyway, were members of the council. As the men said, we haven't had a dishonest person in the state for 1,000 years. Even I know that much. Of course, this left me with lots of time on my hands. That's how I happened to get her in the first place. I'd always wanted one, but pet were forbidden. Busy people didn't have time for them, so I knew I was breaking the law. But I figured that no one would ever find out. First, I fixed a place for her and made a brush screen. So that she couldn't be seen by anyone coming to the gates. Then one night I sneaked into the forest and got her. It wasn't so lonely after that. Now I had something to talk to. She was small when I got her. It would be too dangerous to go near a full grown one, but she grew rapidly. That was because I caught small animals and brought them to her. Not having to depend on what she could catch. She grew almost twice as fast as usual and was so sleek and pretty. Really, she was a pet to be proud of. I don't know how I could have stood the four months there alone if I hadn't heard to talk to. I don't think she really understands me, but I pretended she did and that helped. Every three or four weeks, three of the council members came to take a part of the treasure or to add to it. Always three of them. That's why I was so surprised one day to see one man coming by himself. It was grim. The little old member who had recommended that I'd be given this job. I was happy to see him and we talked for a while. Mostly about my work and how I liked it. I almost told him about my pet but I didn't because he might be angry at me for breaking the law. Finally, he asked me to give him the key. I've been sent to get something from the treasure he explained. I was unhappy to displease him but I said, I can't let you have it. There must be three members. You know that. Of course, I know it. But something came up suddenly. So they sent me alone. Now let me have it. I shook my head. That was the one order they had given me. Never to give the key to any one person who came alone. Grim became quite angry. You idiot, you shouted. Why do you think I had you put out here? It was so I could get in there and help myself to the treasure. But that would be dishonest. And there are notice on us people in the state. For 3,000 years, I know. His usually kind face had an ugly look I had never seen before. I'm going to get part of that treasure and it won't do you any good to report it because no one is going to take the word of a fool like you against a respected council member. Don't think you are dishonest one. Now give me that key. It's a terrible thing to disobey a council member. But if I obeyed him, I would be disopaying all the others. And that would be worse. No, I shouted. He threw himself upon me. For his size and age, he was very strong, stronger even than I. I fought as hard as I could, but I knew I wouldn't be able to keep him away from the key for very long. And if he took the treasure, I would be blamed. The council would have to think a new punishment for dishonesty. Whatever it was, it would be terrible indeed. He drew back and rushed at me. Dress as he hit me, my foot caught upon a route and I fell. His rushed carried him past me and he crashed through the brush screen beside the path. I heard him scream twice. And then there was silence. I was bruised all over, but I managed to pull myself up and take away what was left of the screen. It was no sign of grim, but my beautiful pet was waving her pearl green feelers as she always did in thanks for a good meal. That's why I can't tell anyone what happened. No one would believe that grim would be dishonest and I can't prove it because she ate the proof. Even if I did tell them, no one is going to believe that a fly catcher plant, even a big one like mine would actually be able to eat a man. So they think that grim disappeared and I'm still out here with her. She's grown so much larger now and more beautiful than ever, but I hope she hasn't developed a taste for human flesh. Lately, when she stretches out her feelers, it seems that she's trying to reach me.

Never do tomorrow what you can put off until after the age of 40. One thing about an electronic awakening. No matter how elaborate it's hook up, melodious its music, and important. It's announced reminders when it goes on in the morning you can always turn it off again. Boswell W. Budge always did exactly that. But there's no turning off ones, kids, and thus on the most important morning of his life. February 30, 254 Bosia Rose much against his will promptly at 0800. His Sophie, eight and lady like merely shook the bed with a disdainful gesture. But Howard, six masculine and athletic climbed right up and sat on Bosis stomach. Baby Ralph of the golden smile gave Bosie a big kiss, and Bosie thus shared the gold which was egg. Did you mother sang you in here? Bosie demanded gazing suspiciously around with one eye open. We came because we love you. Sophie answered. That opened Bosis other eye. Thank you dear, he said. You're very sweet or very clever. Now if you'll coax Howard off my stomach, I don't have to be coaxed. Howard announced sliding to the floor with all the covers. From now on you just order me daddy because you'll be a senior citizen tomorrow. Bosie didn't want to think of that just then. Tell your mother I'm up, he said, and get out so I can bathe and dress. Sophie minced Howard ran Ralph Toddled. Bosie rose a pudgy man slightly under average height at 6 feet 2 with blue eyes and thinning brown hair. He was exactly 39 years, 11 months and 29 days old, and that was the point. At 40, he would have to go to work. This was his day for job taking. He dreaded it. He put the coming ceremonies out of his bind and concentrated on his supersonic bath, the dipylatory cream, the color of his outer clothing. It took time to achieve the right shade of purple in the bathroom plastic dispenser, but no time at all to pour, solidify, and cut. The sheet like robe required for the occasion. In it he was the sensation of the breakfast room. Handsome is a male bird in spring plumage. Kate is slender wife who had been up in a work for an hour, looked moth eaten by comparison. As if their nest had been lined with her plucked out down. You look very attractive this morning, Kate. Bosie told her, he gave her an extra warm kiss. Well, she said, quite the gallon today aren't we? Just be sure you're on time today, darling. Remember what Mr. Frun had to say about promptness? Frun, that over inflated windbag. The obesity, who was about to become his boss. Without having worked a day in his life, Bosie found he hated the idea of having a boss. Let's think of something pleasant. He grunted and thought a breakfast. He took his place at the table. Kate and the kids had already eaten. So Kate served, well, the kids attracted by his fine-re. Stood off and watched him swallow a vitamin pill, a thyroid pill, and a dexidrine pill. Solumely, he opened the three eggs Kate brought. Each was guaranteed by her to have been irradiated for exactly two minutes and 55 seconds, and guaranteed by the grocer to have been enriched by feeding the hands three kinds of mold. His mouth was full of the third and last one, when Sophie asked, why do you have to go to work, Daddy? The reminder choked him, gulp, he said, to support us all honey. My pension stops tomorrow. Yes, but I read in a book where people used to go to work when they were young. He was tempted to say, I am young, but thought better of it. That was long ago, dear. Were people different than? No, but society was. Our senior citizens used to be pensioned off. Well, younger people worked, but when science improved the seniors' health, they got tired of sitting in corners on pensions and besides, a lot of them died soon after they stopped working. When it got so that more than half of all voters were between 40 and 70 years old, the seniors voted their pensions to the young to get educated and raise families on, and nobody's allowed to work till he's 40. Now do you see? 40 is awful old. Said Sophie. Howard had meanwhile taken his mother's hand. You're not going to work, are you mommy? Yes, not for 10 years, dear. I'll be here when you want me, so why don't you go play on the balcony? I've got to get daddy off and give Ralph his bath. I'll be them, Sophie volunteered. You help, howie. We can make like we were young. Don't drop him. Kate warned. Clean up the bathroom afterward. That at Basie. Yes, sir, said Howard, for the first time in his life. The children left, and Kate came close to poor, Basie has a cup of daystart. He slipped in arm around her waist and squeezed, convulsively. Darling, she said, stroking his bolts, but you're positively trembling. Wouldn't you be if you had to take over from somebody you like as well as I like Mr. Kojak? And for no good reason, except he's 75 and I'll soon be 40. Kate pushed away from him, frowning. Sometimes you're so silly, it scares me. You know perfectly well that if you don't take Mr. Kojak's job, someone else will. He'd rather have it in your hands than in a strangers, and I'd rather live on his income than on a laborer's. So stop moping and drink your daystart while I call a cab. No helping that quarter, Basie decided as she left. All Kate could think of. It was that she'd soon be the wife of a big shot, the manager. That is control center of a furniture factory. Basie had never told her how simple the job really was. Though he's polishing new, you first ordered designs and then you ordered a pull taken on the designs. A computer tabulated the poles, results, and pointed out the design most likely to sell. You then fed economic data into the same computer and found out how many units the market could take. You called in the engineers to set up the machines and the maintenance man to keep them running. And brief, you were Aaron Boy, to a bunch of gadgets with nothing to do but look important. He was practicing his important look when Kate bustled in and spoiled it by sitting on his lap. You're going to do fine today, she said. And you're going to get off to a good start. I made them show me your cab. It's one of their brand new battery electric ones. A sort of mob that will go with your purple robe. You look swell in it. Basie was kissing her when the lobby buzzers sounded three long rings. There's your cab, Kate said rising. He followed her to the living room. Projected on one wall was a picture of the cabin, facing the lobby and on seeator. 53 stories down. The man was tall, fat, and in need of a shave. Yet he wore purple tights with pink and green trim. Basie shuddered. Who in the world can cock to that rig? Your wife, sir, the cabin answered. It's beautiful, said Basie. I'll be right down. He wasn't though. Kate told the kids he was leaving and they trooped out of the bathroom to say goodbye. Basie could tell Ralph. It was the one being bathed not only because he was naked. All three were equally wet and equally anxious to embrace their daddy. He had to make himself a new robe while the cab met her ticked and Kate jittered. But once started, the drive between balcony buildings and intervening plazas went fast enough. Basie wasn't over half an hour late in reaching Mr. Kojak's apartment building. The old man waited in the street looking spare, spruce, and impatient. I do wish he said he's in himself into the cab that you had a less anti-social attitude. Now you'll have to claim I delayed you. I'm sorry, sir. Basie mumbled. It's kind of you to take the blame. He thought it was also typical. He had understood it, Mr. Kojak, for the proceeding two years, and felt there was no one else in the world for whom he could have as much respect. Actually, sir, he explained, I was delayed by the children. And excuse Baswell, whether conscious or subconscious, nothing more than an excuse. Distaste for today's ceremonial is smeared over your face like so much bread and jelly. Unconsciously, Basie wiped his cheeks. Mr. Kojak laughed, he or guilt-ridden, and that's plain absurd. All young men in your position have to go through exactly the same thing. You must simply make up your mind to do what society requires. All I can think of is your kindness, Basie blurted. People should replace those the hate. But the understudy system wouldn't work then. Mr. Kojak pointed out, you can't learn from a man who upset you. Basie nodded miserably. In silence, you let himself be carried toward the furniture factory. Till Mr. Kojak asked, did you bring the stimulants? Oh, yes, sir. Excuse me, I should have offered them sooner. With embarrassed clumsiness, he fished from a pocket and is underwear the pills required by custom. Here you are, sir. He said in ritual form, big pills make troubles little. Mr. Kojak smiled, I don't need any, he said gently, you do. Take one. That isn't proper. No one will know go ahead. He would feel like a fool to take a pill, brought only for Mr. Kojak's use. He would feel much more like a fool if he broke down during the ceremony. Might even lose its job. He took the pill, finally, and immediately felt sorry. He was still tense and twitchy when they reached the factory. As custom demanded, everyone was out of sight. Nobody met them at the gate, or observed their silent progress up to the escalator to the personnel office. Noisolously, through empty soundproof offices, they walked together to the ceremonial chamber. The door they used was the rooms only entrance. It was hooked open and vitingly. Within was a small conference table, no limitation, oak, and six chairs of imitation leather. Sealing, walls, and floor were plastic sheets, and soft, sandy shades that harmonized with the furniture's rich browns. On the table were four wristlets, four ankleats, and two belts, all made of iron links, and stamped with either bozzies or Mr. Kojak's name. As he had been told to do, bozzie picked out and put on his own set, while Mr. Kojak rested in the armchair at the head of the table. Then, breathing noisolally, enelped before Mr. Kojak and fastened the old man's ankleats. He rose, grunting. Mr. Kojak held out first the left hand, then the right, while bozzie put the wristlets on him. Their cheeks accidentally touched while bozzie fastened the belt. He thought of his father, and was the rationally tempted to plant a kiss, as if he were four instead of 40. He stifled the impulse, and shook hands instead. Good luck, Mr. Kojak said. The procedure did not call for that remark, and so for a second, bozzie forgot what came next. Then, help by the stimulant pill, he focused his thoughts, crossed the room, and turned a lighted red switch that glowed by the door. He heard a muffled clank, as ironed lanks froze to the magnetized armchair, sounding the signal for his speech. Sir, he entoned. The company takes this opportunity to express its deep and heartfelt appreciation. Of the 35 years you have devoted to serving the company, the furniture industry generally, and that great public hour customers. Without looking at Mr. Kojak, he bowed, turned, went out, and released the catch holding the door open. It closed automatically, and automatically set in motion the rest of the ceremony. From somewhere out of sight, Fath Mr. Froon, waddled over, and briefly shook bozzie's hand. You've done fine, he wheezed. A little late getting started, but that's to be expected. Everything's fine, just fine. Praise seemed to miscuse, bozzie didn't quite know how to answer. Sir, he asked, mopping his forehead. What about Mr. Kojak? Oh, he's all right, Mr. Froon said. Those fumes are fast, we can leave the rest to the undertaker. He slept bozzie on the back and pushed him down the corridor. Come on into my office, boy. I'll pour you a drink. Pour a Siege one, a matter of fact, and hand over your iron jewelry son, you won't need that stuff again for 35 years.

Library of the World's Best Literature Ancient and Modern by 11. Times by Richard Henry Dana-Singer 1787-1879. Richard Henry Dana, the elder, although he died less than 20 years ago, belonged to the first generation of American writers. He was born in 1787 in Cambridge, four years after Washington Irving. He came of a distinguished and scholarly family. His father had been minister to Russia during the Revolution, and afterwards chief justice of Massachusetts. Through his mother he was descended from Anne Bradstreet. At the age of 10 he went to Newport to live with his maternal grandfather William Eleurrey, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and remained until he entered Harvard. The wild rock-bound coast scenery impressed him deeply, and never after the sea was one of his ruling passions. Only one familiar with all the moods of the ocean could have written the book in the year. After quitting college he studied law and was admitted to the Boston Bar. Literature however proved the stronger attraction, and in 1818 he left his profession to assist in conducting the then newly founded North American Review. The critical papers he contributed to it startled the conservative literary circles by their audacity and defending the new movement in English poetry and passing lightly by their idle pope. Indeed his unpopularity debarded him from succeeding the first editor. He withdrew and began the publication of the idle man in numbers, modeled on Salma Gundi and the sketchbook. His contributions consisted of critical papers and his novelettes Paul Felton, Tom Thornton and Edward and Mary. Not finding many readers he discontinued it after the first volume. Many then contributed for some years to the New York Review conducted by William Colin Bryant and to the United States Review. In 1827 appeared the book in the year and other poems. In 1833 the same volume was enlarged and the contributions to the idle man were added under the title poems and prose writings. 17 years later he closed his literary career by publishing the complete edition of his poems and prose writings in two volumes, but having materially added either to his verse or fiction. After that time he lived in retirement spending his summers in his seaside home by the rocks and breakers of Cape Ann and the winters in Boston. He died in 1879. Dennis Literary Activity falls within the first third of this century. In that period unproductive a great work he ranked among the four most writers, his papers in the North American Review as the first original criticism on this side of the Atlantic marked an era in our letters. He was one of the first to recognize the genius of Wordsworth and of Colourange. Under the influence of the latter he wrote the poem by which he is chiefly known the Buck and Ear. He climbed forward a basis of truth. It is in fact a story out of the Pirates' own book with the element of the supernatural added to convey the moral lesson. His verses contained in his linder volume. It lacks fluency and melody but shows keen perception of nature's beauty, especially in her stoner, war-solum moons, and sympathy with the human heart. Dana was not so much of poet born with the inevitable gift of song, he would otherwise not have become almost silent during the last 50 years of his life. As a man of strong intellect, who in his youth turned to verse for recreation. Though best known by his poems, he stands out strongest and most original as novelist. Paul Felton, his masterpiece in prose, is a powerful study of a disease condition of mind. In its searching psychological analysis it stands quite apart from the more or less flaccid production of its day. END could not escape the influence of Charles Brockton Brown, whom he greatly admired, and he in turn reached out forward to Poe and other writers of the analytics school. One powerful story of Poe's indeed seems to have been suggested by Dana's work. The demon horse in Metz and Gerdstein is a superior copy of the spectre horse in the Buck and Ear. These stories were not popular in his day, they were too remote from ordinary life, too gloomy and painful. They have no definite locality or nationality, their characters have little in common with everyday humanity. His prose style, however, is clear, direct and strong. Even after he ceased to write, he had an important influence on American letters by the independent of his opinions, his friendships with literary men, chief among whom was Bryant and his life interests in the younger literature, produced under conditions more favorable and more inspiring than he had known. The island from the Buck and Ear. The island lies nine leagues away, along its solitary shore of Kraggy Rock and Sandi Bay, no sound but oceans roar. They wear the bold wild seabird makes her home. Her shrill cry coming through the sparkling foam. But when the light winds lie at rest and on the glassy heaving sea, the black duck with her glossy breast sits sweet silently. How beautiful, no ripples break the reach and silvery waves go noiseless up the beach. An inland rests the green warm down. The brook comes tinkling down its side. From out the trees the seabird bell rings cheerful far and wide. Mingling is sound with the bleeding of the flocks that feed about the veil among the rocks. Or holy bell, nor pastoral bleet, informer days within the veil. Flapped in the bay the pirate sheet. Cruces were on the gale. Rich goods lay on the sand and murdered men. Pirate and record kept their revils then. The calm low voices, words of grace now slowly fall upon the ear. A quiet look is in each face, subdued with holy fear. Each motion jettle all is kindly done. Come listen, how from crime this aisle was won. The doom of Lee from the back near. Who's sitting of that long black ledge which makes so far out in the sea, feeling the kelpweed on its ledge. Poor idle Matthew Lee. So weak and pale? A year little more and bravely did he lured it round this shore. And on the shingles now he sits and rolls the pebbles' naith his hands. Now walks the beach, then stops by fits and scores the smooth wet sands. Then tries each cliff and cold and jettled that bounds the aisles. Then home from many weary rounds. They ask him why he wanders so from day to day the uneven strand. I wish I wish that I might go, but I would go by land and there's no way that I can find I've tried all day and night. He seward looked and sighed. It brought the tear to many and I that once his eye had made to quail. Lee go with us, our snoop as night. Some help us hoist her sail. He shook. You know the spirit horse I ride. He'll let me on the sea with none beside it. He views the ships they come and go, looking so like to living things. Oh, to his approud and gallant show, a bright and broad spread wings, making it light around them as they keep their course right onward through the unsound to deep. And where the far off sand bars lift their backs in long and narrow line, the breaker shot and leap and shift and send the sparkling brine into the air, then rushed to mimic strife. Glad creatures of the sea and full of life. But not to Lee. He sits alone. No fellowship nor joy for him. Born down by wall, he makes no moon. No tears will sometimes dim that asky-ni. Oh, how his worn thoughts creed. Not joy again, but rest within the grave. Tonight the charmed numbers told, twice have I come for thee it's said. What's more an unsheld thee behold, come, live one to the dead. So here's his soul and fears the coming night. At sick and weary of the soft calm light. Again, he sits within that room. All day he leans on that still board, none to bring comfort to his gloom or speak a friendly word. Weakin' with fear, loan hunted by remorse, poor shattered wretch, their wates he, that pale horse. Not long he waits. He now are gone peak-sitredale and tower that stood beautiful, while the west sun shone and bade them in his flood of airy gold. Suddenly darkness fell. And down they went to peak, tower and sitredale. The darkness like a dome of stone seals up the heavens. His hush is death. All but the oceans dull low-moan. How hard Lee draws his breath. He shutters as he feels the working power. Arouse thee lee, up, man thee for thy nower. Disclose at hand for there once more the burning ship. Why sheets a flame and shaft it fire she showed before. Twice this she hither came. But now she rolls a naked hulk and throws a wasting light. Then settling down she goes. And where she sank up slowly came the specter horse from out the sea. And there he stands, his pale sides flame. He'll meet thee shortly lee. He treads the waters as a solid floor. He's moving on. Lee waits him at the door. Their met. I know thou comes to for me thee spirit to the specter said. I know that I must go with thee. Take me not to the dead. It was not I alone that did the deed. Dreadful the eye of that still spectral steed. Lee cannot turn. There's a force in that fixed eye which holds him fast. I'll still they stand, the man, and the horse. Thy nower is almost past. So spare me Christ the Ratch. thou fearful one. My time is full. I must not go alone. I'm weak in fate. Let me stay. Nay, murderer, rest nor stay for thee. The horse and man are on their way. He bears him to the sea. Hark, how the specter breathes through the still night. See from his nostril steams a deathly light. He's on the beach, but stop's not there. He's on the sea. That dreadful horse. Lee flees and rise in wild despair. In vain. The spirit course holds him by fearful spell. He cannot leap within that horde light. He rides the deep. It lights the sea around their track. The curling comb. The dark steel wave. They yet sit's lee the specters back. Gone. Gone and unto save. They're seen no more than night has shut them in. May heaven have pity on thee, man of sin. The earth has washed away its stain. The sealed up sky is breaking forth, mustering its glorious hosts again. From the far south and north, the climbing moon plays on the rippling sea. Will wither on its waters righteth lee.

Short Mystery and Suspense Collection 010,Various,99356,5.0,"January 15, 2021",[],0,"revox.org. Recording by Colleen McMahon. Good night, Mr. Lanin. Louise Willaby extended her hand. We breakfast at nine, she said, I'll see you then. I hope you sleep well. Thank you. I'm sure I shall. She gathered the folds of an embroidered chiffon gown about her, and slowly mounted the stairs. Lanin stood leaning against the null post and watched her ascend. As he turned away, he faced his host. The cold metallic glitter in the older man's black eyes gave him a strange uncomfortable feeling. Well, said Willaby. She's charming Andrew, you should be proud of her. She's improved wonderfully in the three years since I saw her. The slow smile crept about the drawn lips of the physician. It did not extend to his eyes, but became lost in the heavy mustache and vandike beard he wore. Lanin again shivered. The sneaky glitter in his physician friend's eyes fascinated him. He wondered if it could be true, that the woman who had just left him, with purity written on every curve and line of her, could be the wanton thing her husband fancied. That she had so forgotten herself and her social position, as to stoop to an intrigue with her gardener. It seemed impossible of Willaby. Yet many changes had taken place during the three years he'd been abroad. He'd not known her well before his departure. Perhaps he did not know her at all now. Come up into my laboratory. Willaby said suddenly. He closed the windows and switched off all the lights with the exception of one held in a bronze venous at the foot of the stairs. Andy, Lanin said, is they entered the heavily odorous room? I'd rather you said nothing more about this to me. Someday you'll be sorry for having taken me into your confidence and then our friendship will end. There are some things a man has no right to discuss with another. I don't need to remind you of that. This is one of them. I've got to talk to someone or go mad. You think it's my imagination. You think I'm a jealous fool. I tell you, I know. From the day that man came here, she's been different. I've watched them. I've seen his arm around her. I've heard him call her Louise. He broke and buried his head on his arms. He'd flung on the table before him. Lanin gricked his shoulder and shook him. Why don't you send him away? Willaby raised his bloodshot eyes. And admit defeat? Give him the pleasure of saying he was fired because Andrew Willaby's wife fell in love with him never. Besides, he sprang to his feet and paced the little room nervously. His long hands with their narrowed crooked fingers stained with chemicals twitching and pulling it as coat as he walked. I don't know she won't go with him if I send him away. Lanin remembered the brief glimpse he'd had of the gardener. A slim, tall fellow, little more than a boy. With close-cropped dark hair, a pale, almost ethereal face, a quiet, unassuming manner. How long has he been here? Alluring six weeks. Willaby hit the glass top table nervously. As he did so, a tiny vial of amber-colored liquid fell over, knocking the stopper out of it. A pungent, sickish odor filled the room. The doctor gave a startled cry. Flinging a small rubber blanket over the table, he lifted the vial gingerly. He placed the stopper back in it, carefully keeping it away from his face. Then he covered it with the rubber. He'd become ash and colored. As though unable to speak, he motioned to Lanin to throw up the windows. Damn careless of me, he muttered a moment later. He placed the bottle high up in a cabinet above him. Then he locked the door of the chest. Damn careless. It's an experiment of bin Arthur. Do you feel alright? Lanin left unisly. I shouldn't care to remain in here long with that odor. It's hadty to say the least. Willaby poured some liquid from another bottle into a small glass and handed it to him. Then he took a draft of it himself. Drake this, it'll overcome the effects of the other. Suddenly he became tense. The glitter in his eyes became more pronounced. He seemed to be listening to something. The warm salt air blowing through the window brought a hint of the distant sea. And something else. What is it, Lanin gasped? The quivering of Willaby's wide nostrils. The sudden snapping of the glass's stem and trig tip. Listen, a long sort of growl, than a long drawn how from a dog someplace not far off was all Lanin hurt. There was another how, then silence. The color came back to the physician's face. He smiled apologetically. Lanin stared at him and bewilderment. What is it? He asked again. I thought I heard or come down the stairs. I was listening to hear if he met her. The man's tongue seemed to be thick. He spoke with difficulty. Buck up old man, buck up. Lanin gave him a reassuring slap on the shoulder. But at the same time, he glanced apprehensively over his shoulder out of the window toward the garden's beyond. Again, the long rumbling howl of the dog penetrated the night air. The older man suddenly looked at the window and then he looked at the window. The older man suddenly lurched forward into a chair and began to sob in a broken-hearted way. At that moment, Lanin fancied he saw a face at the open window. But before he could ascertain whether it was his imagination or not, it had vanished. But to him it seemed he had seen a young pale face with smoldering dark eyes and close cropped air. Who he exclaimed, what's wrong with me? Two. The sudden clamor of a clock striking three startled him out of a sound sleep. At least he thought it was the striking of the hour which did it. But as he raised himself on one elbow in the darkness, the doubled beat of his heart, the damp chill of his flesh, told him it was something else which had awakened him. Stealthy footsteps outside his room, the cautious opening and closing of a door down the hall. The rustle of garments, as if someone moving in the corridor, were registered with dark significance on his brain. Poor old Andrew, he muttered. He sank back to his pillow but he could not sleep, though his pulse became normal. He found himself striving to make out the objects in his room. One by one out of the hazy gray of the blackness, they became outlined invisible to his straining eyes. In an irritating fashion the drawn blind flacked forward and back with the wind, which had a risen since nightfall. Unable to stand the sound of the flapping, he rose and went to the window to raise it. The moon was high, unobscured by any clouds, and shone down with the dazzling white brilliance, which made the grounds and surrounding territory almost as light as day. The long row of glass-topped greenhouse is gleamed, as though covered with snow. Often the distance far beyond the high stone wall, which enclosed Dr. Willabee's long island estate, shone the water near it hand. The wind whistled in a sing-song manner through the trees. From the darkening shelter of the stone wall emerged two figures. The watching man knew instantly who they were, even before the moon outlined the slender figure of Willabee's wife, and the broader silhouette of the gardener, Allerang. A feeling of nauseous swept over him. He turned away from the window, crossing to his bed he switched on a light just over it, determined to while away the time until daylight with a current magazine. But the face of the woman outside in the garden seemed to mock him from the printed page. Her dark shadow-laden eyes seemed to plead with him between the lines of printing, as though she begged him not to judge her to harshly. The magazine slipped from his hand. He closed his eyes and lay in her. A moment later, the cry of someone immortal agony penetrated the night air. Then a woman shrieked in terror. For a moment, laden lay panic-stricken. Then, springing out of bed, he statched up a dressing gown and rushed into the hall. He came face to face with Willabee. His host was pallid. Willabee's hands trembled as he held a tattered silk gown about his emission figure. A moment later, another door down the hall was thrown open, and the corpulent, kimono-clad housekeeper burst into their presence. You heard it? Willabee cried in a harsh whisper, clutching land in zarm. His eyes were glassy, the lid swollen as though from heavy sleep and being suddenly awakened. His chin shook. My God! My God! Willabee, the woman trying to pull a kimono about her ample bosom? What was it, doctor? Did you hear it? A woman screamed, laden and said, Grimley, the cry came from someplace near the greenhouse. Someone must be injured. I heard a man, too. This from the Butler who had joined them. Even partially clad, he retained some of the dignity of his position. Oh, what do you suppose has happened? Doctor Deer, what do you think it is? The housekeeper caught her master's arm and clung desperately to him. He did not seem to be conscious of her presence. He was looking into the lighted corridor below at his wife, as she stumbled blindly through the outer door into the illuminated passageway. She was sobbing convulsively. She started to climb the stairs slowly, dragging herself upward with an effort. Her shimmery evening gown was torn and draggled about her. Her face was gray, a death color, and her eyes terror-stricken. At the head of the stairs, she collapsed in a heap. When Willabee started to lift her, she gave a shattering cry and warded off his touch. Her husband gave a sucking breath. He looked at Lanin. Mrs. Willabee cried the latter, dropping on his knees beside her. So consciously he wondered what had become of the man who had been with her. If it were he who had given that cry of terrible torture. Mrs. Willabee, what is it? What has happened? For a moment, her white lips quivered. Hi, there's a dead man out there by the greenhouse. Is I stumbled over him? I touched his cold face. I a dead man. Yes, she suddenly straightened and stared with a fixity into her husband's face. A strange expression came over her own. Then she allowed Lanin to assist her to rise, and an quiet manner. Though with obvious effort, she requested the butler to bring her some wine. A dead man. Come, said Lanin abruptly, his legal training coming to the foreground. She may be mistaken. The man may still be alive. He was cold, she answered. The little procession filed out toward the greenhouse's, a motley weird-looking crowd in bathrooms, smoking jackets and kimonos. Louise Willabee walked with Lanin and her husband. Her hand to lightly rested on Lanin's all the way. He felt the nervous tremors that shook her as they neared the spot where she had discovered the dead man. Their lights in the greenhouse will be set abruptly. I'll turn them on. He left them for a moment, then the glass enclosure became illuminated. An exclamation of horror burst from the group. Mrs. Willabee clung to Lanin's arm in a feverish manner. Huddled up, chest and chin meeting, laid the body of a man unquestionably dead. He was roughly dressed, his shoes and tatters, his bare feet showing through the gaping souls. While several days growth of beard added to the gruesomeness of his appearance. Long yellow teeth were buried in a distortion of agony. Blurie eyes stared upward. There was no sign of a wound, no indications of foul play. But the man had unquestionably died suddenly, any great torture. Evidently it had been his death cry they had heard. Willabee knelt beside him, then after a second examination rose abruptly. Jed, heart failure, I think, but it'll be best to notify the police. No him, Lanin asked. No, he looks like a hobo. Are you going to leave him? Cryed his wife hysterically. It seems so awful to leave a dead man out here on the ground alone. It's so heartless. He can't be moved until the police arrive, Lanin answered. Willabee, take your wife inside. I'll stay here until they come and see that nothing happens. Louise Willabee suddenly gave a cry of terror. The police must you call the police? He's a tramp. He died of heart failure. Don't call the police. It'll create a scandal. I couldn't stand that. Please, please do something else. My dear, my dear, Remin stated her husband quietly. This is very unfortunate. I'm sorry the poor devil chose to die here, but it may not be heart failure you know. He may have been murdered. Murdered. She sobbed to the word, as though it burst from her against her will. Willabee ignored her exclamation. He continued swallowing as though he enjoyed her hysterical anguish. If the man has been murdered and we placed an obstacle in the way of his murderer being apprehended, we would be putting ourselves liable from more than a scandal. She suddenly swayed. Willabee placed his hand on her shoulder, but she turned on him and almost insane fury. Don't touch me, she cried. Don't you dare to touch me. The doctor shrugged his shoulders, turning quietly to his friend. You take her inside, Lanin. She's brought up. No wonder poor child. I'll remain here. Call headquarters, please. Three. When they reach the house, the woman dropped weirdly into great chair. The intense pain in her face, the tremulous quiver of her mouth, caused a wave of pity to sweep over Lanin. Are you going to call the police? She whispered. I must. Her white hand's grip tighter, in spite of the things he'd seen, Lanin again had a doubt as to her perfity. Strangely enough, he now felt no sympathy for her husband. He lifted the receiver from the hook, as he did so she touched him. Mr. Lanin? Yes. Are you my friend? Yes. What? Yes. Of course, Mrs. Willabee. I mean, really, truly, my friend or his. Andrews? Yes. I trust I'm a friend to you both. He evaded. She shook her head impatiently. You can't be that. Can't you see he hates me and I, I love him. I despise him. Oh my God, how I hate him and yet Mrs. Willabee. I know I horrify you. She laughed and began to pace the length of the room. If only I had someone I could turn to, someone to aid me, someone in all the world I could trust, you seem to be a good man. If only I dared, she paused abruptly. Then in a sudden change, do you think I'm a bad woman? Do you think what he thinks? Wait, my dear lady, I see. He's like to you too. Poison to you against me. As he has others and she cover her face with her hands. I really, I, for once he could not find words, Mrs. Willabee, I saw you tonight. You saw me and her eyes open wide and him. As she said nothing, he turned from her and called up the police headquarters, making his request for their presence in a quiet professional manner. When he hung up the receiver, he turned to her. Mrs. Willabee, you found the body. Who was with you at the time? She did not reply. After waiting a moment for her to speak, he continued, you realize that the police will ask questions of you when they arrive. As a lawyer and your friend, I'm advising you to tell me everything before they come. I may make things easier for you. He's easier for me. She repeated, I've done nothing, nothing wrong. I think it is murder. Lannan said slowly. She wet her dry lips with the tip of her tongue. Yes, it is murder. I know that. She whispered, how do you know? He said sharply, she shivered. I, she gave a little historical laugh. Just as a woman intuitively knows many things, something here. It tells me that it is. Did you know the man? No, no, of course not. I never saw him before. Did she hear what Andrew said? He's a tramp. A hobo, probably, probably. Her voice trailed off and her dark eyes widened. Probably what? Lannan leaned forward and laid his hand on hers. Her skin was damp and ice cold. Probably he stopped in the grounds to sleep for a drink of water and Mr. Lannan, I can't talk. I'm, you'll excuse me. I must go upstairs. I, she rose unsteadily and for a moment seemed about the faint. You can call me when they arrive. Perhaps I'll feel better then. He assisted her to the stairs, watched her slowly mount them, then turned back into the room more puzzled than before. As he sank into a deep cushion chair before the window, heavy sat and draperies behind him were pushed aside. A young man wearing mud stained overalls in a dark blue shirt stepped into the room. He held one finger up to caution Lannan to silence, then motioned him to draw the blinds so that their figures could not be seen by the men outside who waited by the greenhouses. Well, said Lannan. The other slumped into a chair opposite to him. He suddenly seemed overcome and unable to speak. Lannan noted the way his hands trembled, his nostrils quivered. After a moment silence, the lawyer asked, you're alluring the gardener, aren't you? Yes, sir. He leaned forward almost touching Lannan, his eyes glowed in his eagerness. You sent for the police? Yes. Lannan reached her cigar and lighted it before he answered the boy. In that brief moment survey of the gardener, he felt instinctive liking for him. It might be murder, you know, he added, it was murder, Mr. Lannan. That poor fellow out there died the death that was intended for me. What do you mean by that? Lannan dropped a cigar and quickly rescued it from the carpet. I'm not going to hide anything, sir, only. Only I can't face the police, not yet. I can't tell you. But can't you tell them what I say and keep me out of their way? Isn't it possible? His white face worked convulsively. He spoke as though compelled to do so against his will. I don't understand you, said the other man coldly. You say someone desired your death, yet you don't want to inform the police yourself. Don't you realize that you'll have to testify? You are with Mrs. Willaby once you stumbled over the body. Yes, sir? I'm a lawyer alluring. Perhaps you didn't know that. Yes, yes, I know it. That's why I'm asking you to help me to help Louise. I, Lannan wins, as he used the Christian name of his friend's wife, but the gardener did not see the movement. You didn't kill the man, did you? Snaptal, Lannan, suddenly? No, no, good God, no. Well, then will you be kind enough to explain just what is it all about? He hates me, alluring continued. Who? Andrew? Andrew Willaby? He hates me as much as he fears me. Lannan started angrily to his feet. Willaby's my friend. The younger man left stridently. Friend. He's no man's friend. There's only one thing in the world of any value to him. That's science. Didn't you see how I took the death of that poor dog out there? I was behind a clump of shrub. I heard and saw him. He gloded over his body. He was glad that a man had died and proven another one of his damn nimble poisons efficacious. By God, are you insinuating that Andrew Willaby killed that man out there? I am. A man he'd never seen, a straight tramp. It was intended for me. Alluring returned weirdly. He failed in his purpose, so far as I was concerned, but he made a sure test and it proved successful. You're making an astounding statement, young man, said Lannan, straining to keep his voice calm and uninterested. You are accusing a man of murder. You're employer. The husband of the woman with whom, Alluring sprang to his feet, the veins stood out in great wealth on his high thin forehead. His nostrils quivered. When he again sank into his chair, he was panting from the struggle. Mr. Lannan, he said abruptly, I met Luis, Mrs. Willaby, outside in the grounds. Why did so as our fair? But she is a good woman. You must know she is. Her husband is more than a scoundrel. He's the vialist, lowest. Lannan's gesture interrupted him. He continued in a quiet or tone. We met by an arbor near the greenhouses. It is very dark out there, and in spite of its being moonlight, we weren't seen. But we saw the figure of a man as he came out of the house. It was Andrew Willaby. At first, we thought he had seen Luis leave and was following us. But he passed the arbor and went on toward the greenhouses. In the moonlight, which made everything perfectly visible in the open, I could see he was carrying something. A little case is medicine case. He uses when visiting a patient. I was afraid he could hear Luis's breathing. He passed so close to us. But he was too intent on his wicked thoughts to notice anything else. At the greenhouses, he hesitated. He looked stealthfully around and then he laughed. That laugh made Luis gritt my arm. I put my hand over her mouth for fear she would cry out. There's a hydrant beside one of the houses. I used it every morning to attach the hose. To my knowledge, no one else ever touches it. No one has a case, too. Willaby was aware of this. It is an old fashioned arrangement, and I've protested against it, but the thing is remain as it is. Several times have been drenched by the nozzle slipping. As we watched, Willaby went to this hydrant. He carefully unfass in the hose. Then he opened the little case he carried. He took out something which evidently was a piece of cloth and wiped all the damp off the rusty metal. Then he put the cloth back into the case. Next, he took a small vial out of it, and with great caution poured it all over the metal. Then as quietly as he'd come, he rolled around and went back to the house. Allering paused, then we both stood there in the darkness, unable at first to speak or move he went on. Then Luis whispered, Charlie, what was it? What was he doing? I didn't tell her. I knew he had can drive some diabolical way to get rid of me. Though just how a liquid poison on a piece of metal could do that, I didn't know. I resolved under no conditions to touch it. Luis became frightened and started to cry. She was pent up and nervous before, now she became hysterical. I tried to reassure her and told her she'd best go back to the house, though she tried to control her feelings. I felt she knew instinctively what I did, that her husband had planned my murder. Just as she braaced up and started to leave me, a man vaulted the stone wall and lurched and devu, a pool of moonlight outlining him distinctly. I think he was a tramp or a thief. I'd never seen him before. He wandered about aimlessly until he came to the hydrant. Almost before I knew what he was doing, he had put his mouth to the socket and turned on the water. The next moment he gave that cry you heard. We saw him stagger backwards, fling up his arms, waving them wildly. Then fall over, doubling up and writhing as though unharble pain. It only lasted a moment, then he was dead. The wee screamed, she started to run, she felt twice, I wasn't going to follow her, then I knew I musn't. I crept further back into the shadow of the arbor. After you all came back into the house, I stole out the other way, climbed the wall and returned through the servant's entrance. Why should Andrew wish to kill you, Lannan asked abruptly? Alluring rose again, he crossed to the lawyer and stood under a stand lamp, allowing its light to shine directly on his pallet face. The skin over his cheekbones was drawn and tight, there was a feverish gleam in his eyes. His young mouth was hard and grim, but in spite of everything, there was a look of candor and manliness about him, which impressed Lannan. Arthur Lannan, don't you know me? Why? Why? The vague something which had disturbed Lannan resolved itself into a memory. The memory of a pink cheeked red-haired lad with a sunny smile and almost cherubic cast of countenance. He gave a gasp, charlie more, not charlie more. Yes, Louise's brother, but why? An automobile came into the driveway, stopped with a noisy pair of the engine. Sementalighted, then the doorbell gave him a metallic clatter. The boy clutch, Lannan's arm. For God's sake, keep me out of this, he cried. I'll explain later. Before the lawyer could answer, he had disappeared behind the satin draperies. Four. Lannan opened the door before the servant reached it. The inspector followed by his medical examiner and a couple of officers strode into the hallway. Well, what's the dope? The inspector asked abruptly. He was a large man with a 24 hours crop of blue black beard. His eyes were dark and very keen. He wore horn-wren spectacles, which he kept constantly removing and polishing. Lannan knew that in that brief second survey of the room, he had noticed the almost imperceptible swaying of the curtains as they fell together behind charlie more. You called me, the inspector continued, not waiting for his question to be answered. Yes, where's Willowby? The doctor was well-known on the island. Outside, a dead man was found on the grounds. Some sneak thee for Hobo evidently. We thought it best to send for you. It may be heart failure. It may be murder. All right. Take me to him. As they stepped outside, Lannan realized that morning had arrived. In the hazy light, he saw Dr. Willowby seated on a stone bench. His shaggy bearded chin, cuffed in his hand, as he stared with evident interest at the huddled splotch on the ground before him. The servants had grouped themselves some little distance away, evidently discussing the gruesome event, but at the sight of the officers they hushed abruptly. Lannan glanced quickly at the hydrant. It was open, a slow trickle of water resalted itself into a little rivulet below it, and wended away into a tiny stream toward the greenhouses a trifle below it. Willowby rose leisurely at their appearance, and extended his hand to the inspector. Mr. Dwyer, he said, I'm Dr. Willowby. This is my home. It's unfortunate. Yes, I know, Dr. Dwyer interrupted. The man's dead all right. You don't know him, do you? Willowby shook his head. Now, seems to be a hobo, doesn't he? I fancy he died of heart failure, but I'd rather your examiner pass upon the case. I don't think it's advisable for you to depend solely upon my decision. It's awkward happening on my grounds, you know. He spoke easily. All traces of the strain of the evening before seemed to have vanished. The examiner knelt on the damp ground and took a brief survey of the body. No indication of foul play, he said. He scout on certainly. Then looked from Willowby's face to the inspectors. He seems to have died suddenly with acute agony. Rather an unusual attitude for heart failure to assume, don't you think, sir, Dr. Willowby? I do. That's why I hesitated to diagnose it as such. And yet, the physician leaned closer. I'm not prepared to say it, isn't. Look at Mover Riley, said Dwyer abruptly to a younger man in plain clothes. See if there's anything to identify him on his clothes. Plain hobo said the other after a moment's survey. There were no cards, letters, norm marks of any kind on the body or clothing to lead to any knowledge of the man. Heart failure it is, I take it, said Dwyer grimly. Must have caught the poor devil suddenly. Probably dropped in here to steal the night's lodging and having a bum heart killed over. Lanan started to speak, hesitated, then turned abruptly to Dr. Willowby. There was an any medical look on the physician's bearded face. Lanan almost fancied the triumph gleamed through his black eyes. You, you aren't going to have an inquest? The lawyer queried? Not necessary. Dwyer replied, he's things seem pretty clear to me. He turned deferentially to Willowby. You passed it as heart failure also, didn't you, doctor? Willowby bowed his head in a scent? Willowby the body removed it once. The inspector continued, Riley, you could stay here till the wagon comes. If there's nothing further, we'll bid you good morning. Something seemed to snap in Lanan's brain. The story the young Gardner had told him, the scream the dead man had given, had made too deep an impression on the lawyer's mind to be dismissed lightly. Dr. He exclaimed, touching the medical assistance arm, do persons dying suddenly of heart failure give a cry of mortal agony? Hey, Lanan repeated the question. No, no, I think not. It would be unusual, quite unusual, but not impossible for them to cry out. Death comes to suddenly as a rule for them to make any sound. Death so painful as this. Why do you ask? This man gave a scream, I heard it, so did Mrs. Willowby, who found the body. The inspector dug the blunt toe of his shoe into the grass at his feet. He coughed, then looked at Willowby, back to Lanan's expressive face, then to his assistant. A slow flush mounted to his forehead. This puts another complexion on the matter, he said quietly, where is Mrs. Willowby? In the house, her husband replied, she was badly upset about the matter and is gone in. Stay here, Riley, come on with me the rest of you, and air of alertness had taken hold of Dwyer, as though he suddenly sensed something of interest. As the servants huddled together did not move, he gave a parental gesture toward them and repeated the command for them to return to the house with him. Five. Once inside the house Willowby became a genial host, inquiring of the officers if they desired anything to drink, and when Dwyer accepted with a lacquerty, he ordered the butler to serve all present. Dwyer wondered about the room for a few moments, touching a bit of furniture here, a drapey there, and puffing viciously on a strong and vile-smelling cigar. After he had swallowed a large drink of old whiskey, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, he asked that Mrs. Willowby be called. You heard this fellow scream, he said, turning to Lanan while they waited for her appearance. Yes. Wake you up? No, I was awake. How's that? In Somnia? What time do you scream? About half past four I should judge. No, I don't suffer with in Somnia. I'm usually a heavy sleeper. Something else waking, G. Then. Yes. What? It's hard to say. Possibly being in strange room and bed. I'm a guest here, you know. Possibly the quiet of the country after the city, or I fancy it I heard footsteps outside my door. Willowby leaned forward. His black eyes lightened. The pupils became mere pinpoints. What kind of footsteps? Inquired Dwyer. That I can't state. I'm not prepared to say that I heard any. I may have fancy I did. If I did hear them, they were very soft. Cautious I should say. Man's or a woman's. I don't know. But I think a man's. Willowby sank back in the chair. Gripping the arms of it with long stained fingers. How long after you heard these footsteps wasn't that you heard the scream? I should judge 30 minutes. I lay in bed some little time. Then unable to sleep. I got up and sat by the window. Did your window face those greenhouses? Yes. Did you see this man enter the grounds? No. I'd left the window when he screamed. And you saw nothing suspicious out there. Lannan hesitated. He caught the glance as host directed toward him and coughed. Something impelt him to say no. Louise Willowby came into the room. She'd removed her bedrugled evening gown and had replaced it with a tea gown of lavender satin and lace. Her face was ghastly pale in the morning light. Her eyes wide and very dark. Lannan suddenly felt a great pity for her. Her heavy mass of dark red hair she'd left down and braided into a great robe, which hung over one shoulder. It made her look younger, almost girlish. At her entrance Willowby merely raised his head, looked at her second, then back toward the inspector. She accepted the chair Lannan offered her. You wish to see me? She said. Yes, Mr. Willowby. I'm sorry to disturb you, but this unfortunate death on your grounds makes it necessary. Do Iers' voice unconsciously softened as he addressed her? I understand. Please pardon my appearance. I'd come to bed. You were the first to find the dead man's body, weren't you Mrs. Willowby? Yes. You were alone? No. Her gaze did not falter in order she looked at her husband. Who was with you? A young man, Mr. Allerang. Did this young man, Mr. Allerang, see? She interrupted him. We both saw him fall. Fall. The man wasn't dead when you first saw him? The woman bit her lip. Then she shook her head. No. Mr. Allerang and I were in the arbor near the greenhouses. We saw a man climb over the fence. He staggered. Then her eyes shifted and rested on the face of her husband. Willowby was yellow. His black eyes like beads stared at her with all the fascination of his snake, coiled the spring. She shivered. Then he gave a terrible cry, flung up his arms and fell over riding. I think he died instantly. I screamed too. It was horrible to see him and die. Then I started to run. He lay in my pathway. It was dark. The moon went under cloud right after it happened. I fell. I touched his cold face. She paused, staring straight ahead of her as if visualizing what it took in place. That is all? Said Dwyer? Yes. Let in wonder if Dwyer realized the woman was lying. Where is this allering now? The officer inquired looking about? The servants who had come into the room on returning to the house shook their heads. I don't know. This is Willowby answered. Probably in his room. Snaptor husband. Speaking for the first time. He's the gardener employed here. Dwyer merely raised his eyebrows. He studied the pale Patricia face of the woman. Then turned to one of his assistants. Riley, go with a servant to get him. Six. Dwyer and his medical advisor again traverse the lawn to the greenhouses. Lannon went with them. The operator whom Dwyer had left in charge of the body, Grind a sickly welcome as they approached. Again, Lannon noticed the dripping hydrant. Dwyer stalked about the grounds. Crossing to the greenhouses he opened a door and stepped inside. He was gone but a moment. When he returned, he made a survey of the arbor and the stone wall which surrounded the grounds. The grass was trampled and crushed but no definite footprints were discernible. Stevens, go back to the house and see what's the matter that Riley hasn't found that gardener. He said abruptly. The medical examiner, whose attention had been centered on the dead man, looked up quickly. It's hard failure all right, Dwyer. He said. Dwyer merely grunted. The man who had been with the body hitched his trousers and passed the back of a hairy hand across his mouth. He started briskly toward the house, paused abruptly and whirling around across the hydrant. As he stopped to drink from the faucet, Lannon cried out and in unnatural voice, Don't do that. The young officer straightened abruptly. Speaking to me, yes? Yes. What's the matter? Don't touch that hydrant. Stevens came closer. I don't understand, he said. Wondering if he were making a fool of himself or if what alluring had said were true, Lannon hesitated. The inspector looked at him inquiringly. Lannon left nervously. Well, said Dwyer. He removed his horn rimmed glasses and polished them vigorously. His keen eyes squinted. Lannon inwardly squirmed under the scrutiny. I may be mistaken, the lawyer said unisily, but I'm under the impression that the man died after drinking from that faucet. Stevens whistled. Lannon realized he had told too much to withhold any more and continued quietly. Alluring came to me after Mrs. Willowby retired. He said, the dead man took a drink, Then fell writhing to the ground. He may have imagined it. I don't know, But it's well to take no chances. Mrs. Willowby did not mention this. No. Where did Alluring go? Why hasn't Riley found him? I don't know. Well, he used the inspector, Stan Quir. We'll get a glass, test this water. Here's a tin cup, said the younger officer, reaching for one which hung on a nail just below the hydrant. Lannon suddenly remembered the gardener's words. When he had mentioned the caution Willowby had exercised in wiping the moisture from the faucet. He stepped forward quietly and drawing his hanker chip from his pocket. He wrapped it about his hand before turning the spikot, Then he drew some water and handed it to the medical examiner. It was clear as crystal. Willowby has a laboratory where he makes tests in chemistry. The lawyer said, Stay here. Dwyer said to the operator, he had left with the body before. Then he turned to the others with a curtain out of his head toward the house. Will use the laboratory though I have a hunch there's nothing to this water business. But you never can't tell and we've got to locate this fellow Alluring. Seven. As they entered the house Willowby rose abruptly, Lannon sensed attention in the air as though the physician in his wife had been quarreling. The woman's face was bloodless, the great purple shadows under her eyes and her white lips gave her an almost ethereal beauty. She smiled a wand greeting as they're welcoming the interruption of an unpleasant scene. Dr. Willowby said the inspector abruptly, Dr. Graves here would like to use your laboratory for a little test if you don't mind. Test. Smiled Willowby swarvely. Yes, at the hydrant water. Mr. Lannon is under the impression that the dead hobo took a drink from your hydrant and killed over. Water looks all right, but we'd like to make sure. The smile never left Willowby's face, though Lannon fancied a gruit tighter. I'll be very glad to assist you in any way. The physician said, Though I'm positive the water had nothing to do with the poor chap's death. We don't use it for drinking purposes, but it's pure. However, as you say, it's best to make sure. Come this way if you please, my laboratory's on the top floor. He led the way to the odorous room that was the scene of his many chemical tests. As they reached the door for a second, he hesitated. He drew a deep breath and inserted a key in the lock. It did not turn. The physician looked puzzled. That strange, he muttered, he rattled the knob. Maybe the lock is sprung, said the inspector grimly. Willowby shook his head. It seems to be locked from the inside, he said. The smile left his face. He became yellower if possible. There came to them the Russell of papers inside the room, the sound of someone moving. The men stared at each other. Willowby swayed a trifle and lurched against the door. Dwyer thrust a huge fist forward and gave the panel a resounding kick. Open the store, he called, open it, or will break it down. There was silence. Then, a sound of footsteps and the door was flung open. The gardener stood just inside the room. He had discarded his overalls and looked very much the gentleman in a dark, well-fitting suit. Though he was ghastly pale, there was a triumphant gleam in his dark eyes and an air of success in his bearing. The room was an absolute disorder. Papers were thrown everywhere. Bottles lay at random on glass top tables. Paper baskets were overthrown. The room was an absolute disorder. Papers were thrown everywhere. Bottles lay at random on glass top tables. Paper baskets were overthrown. Everything indicated a hurried but thorough search. One instant willowby glared at his ransacked laboratory. Then into the glowing eyes of the boy whom he seemed to recognize for the first time. Then he flung himself at the younger man with an almost animal-like snarl. Damn you! Allowing step to side. At the same moment, Dwyer laid a heavy hand on his shoulder. Well, he smiled, but the menace and his cool tones made land and shiver. I presume you were the gardener, allowing. No wonder you didn't care to give your testimony to us. We came out here to look into the matter of a heart failure. We hardly expected to be so fortunate as to lay our hands on Charlie Moore. Number 9672 The boy flung back his head and looked bravely into the cool-hard face of the inspector. Number 9672 Gasped Stevens Shared the escaped con, sent up two years ago for manslaughter. Escape six weeks ago. They say a society woman helped him bust out, but I never dreamed it was Mrs. Willowby. She's my sister. Said the boy proudly. Shared. Dwyer bit off the end of a cigar and stuck it in his mouth, but he didn't light it. He looked steadily at the young man, then toward Willowby. The latter's eyes were bloodshot. He seemed to be controlling himself with difficulty. What did you know about this? Dwyer asked him, nothing. Snap the doctor. You didn't recognize him? No. Young Moore laughed unpleasantly. That's a lie. He said, he knew me the moment Louise brought me into this house. She knew he did and so did I, but he didn't dare admit it. If he had, he would have notified you in a minute. He wanted me out of the way, but he was afraid. So he chose the cowardly way. He made everyone think I was her lover and poisoned them against her and then, stop. It was Willowby who exclaimed. The boy shrugged his shoulders. He made some strange statements, young man, said Dwyer quietly, and I must say for a man under arrest and escaped convict, you're damned cool. A Frank smile crawled the others lips. I'm not going back inspector, he said, and don't you think it for one minute? I was that so. You bet your life it is. I spent two years in that hellhole. I was clever enough to make my escape. You can rest assured, I'll be clever enough to keep out of it. What do you think I came here for? That's what I'm wondering, said Dwyer, quietly. You might have known sooner or later we'd have run you down, that we would be certain to come to your sisters for you. Not so certain if that poor devil hadn't died out there, I'd still be safe here. I've had six weeks start of you inspector, that was all I needed. Six weeks too much for you Andrew, but you see, you didn't get me after all. Dwyer flung his cigar from him impatiently, and stepped over the threshold into the disordered laboratory. He closed the door behind him with a snap. Willowby suddenly swayed and dropped into the nearest chair. Now more, said the inspector, no funny business, get me. You're going back with me and you're going back to stay. You were sent up on a poison charge, young man. There's a dead man out there on those grounds. What did you have to do with his death? The boy shrug to shoulders again, then his eyes clouded, a note of pathos crept into his voice. Everything, he said quietly, I suppose if it weren't for me, the poor devil would be alive at this minute. Willowby gave it in our titular cry. Dwyer stared at the ex-gardener, striving to digest his astounding words. Let me get you right, he said slowly, are you confessing that you killed that bum out there? No, said young more, but I'm saying that my brother-in-law Andrew Willowby did. Eight, there was dead silence, then Willowby laughed, he laughed until he shook, then he staggered to his feet and waved along Bony finger at his accuser. He tried to implicate me before you, well, you tried to shift John Gordon's murder on my shoulders, by God, don't you try it again? I never saw that man out there before I, just a minute, the dignity, the note of authority in the boy's voice, seemed to impress even Dwyer, hardened officer of the law that he was. Two years ago, when I came out of college, I came here to study chemistry with Dr. Willowby, my brother-in-law. I was interested in science. He'd gone further into some phases of it than any other teacher I could secure. I became his assistant in numerous tests. John Gordon was another assistant. Why rake all that up? Snept Dwyer impatiently? All that detail came out of the trial. Because you're going to know the truth, because I'm going to prove my statements. I don't know if Andrew Willowby is insane or not, but I do know that in the interest of science, he will stop at nothing, not even murder. Please, he continued raising a silencing hand as they would have interrupted him. He was making some tests of a new, very strange and interesting eastern poison. It left no trace of any kind. A touch of it on a mucus membrane would produce instant death. This was not enough for Dr. Willowby. He was searching for a poison whose mere contact will be deadly. At last he hit upon one, harmless enough liquid. Until combined with metal and moisture. Lannon gave an exclamation of surprise. Willowby had seated himself and now sat staring at the speaker with beaded fascinated eyes. He what his lips would the tip of his tongue, but otherwise made no movement. The trouble with this poison continued more was that the victim died in convulsions. The death being of several moments duration. Consequently, Willowby was still dissatisfied. I don't know what his desire was and making a poisoning of fine art. I don't think that at that time murder was his object. He sacrificed numerous animals in his experiments, even Louise's pet Airdale, an a Persian cat belonging to the housekeeper were destroyed. The brutality of their death, the horrible agony they suffered was getting on my nerves. I wanted to get away. He did not let John Gordon into the secret of these poisons. So Gordon was in total ignorance of Willowby's ambition. I began to fear my brother-in-law. There was an insane glitter in his eyes when it worked. It dawned upon me that he would not endure any obstacle being placed in his way. And that because of my knowledge of his tests, he hated me, although he needed me. Then John Gordon was found dead. His attitude, the tortured expression on his face proved conclusively he had been poisoned. Though if Willowby had not so painstakingly explained the nature of that poison, no one would have detected it in his system. Whether my brother-in-law deliberately killed him as a test, or it was an accident, I'm not prepared to state. I had nothing to do with it. The metal cup which contained the coffee which Gordon drank, I never saw before, so helped me go. Willowby swore in court to my carelessness that I had deliberately left that cup, which had been used on a tea table, and Young Gordon had poured coffee into it and drank it. It was a lie, Dr. Willowby himself did it. I had nothing to support my statement then. I was working for a reputable famous scientist, but was my word against his, with every proof in the world against me. But I made up my mind that the instant those prison doors closed behind me, and I was once again a free man, I would not only prove my innocence, but Andrew Willowby's guilt, and I've done so. He paused abruptly, I escaped. The papers gave the details, I took a chance in coming here, but as Louise's gardener, I was safe from you if Willowby did not recognize me. For a long time, he never noticed me. One servant was the same as another to him, his wife always engaged them. Then he noted our friendship, Louise's in mind, and became jealous. Too late, we recognized our mistake, for the instant he took a good look at me, he knew who I was. As I said, he was cowardly. He knew I had something more than my liberty at stake. He feared me. He was afraid of what I knew of him. He instantly sensed that my presence in his household meant I was spying upon him. He could not send me away. He determined to do away with me. cleverly, he planted the idea in the mind of all his wife's friends that she was unfaithful to him, that I was her lover. He did this so that if he were discovered as my murderer, he would be exonerated for protecting his honor. Then he began to study my habits. No, he wanted to intend it. I ate all my meals and then nearby roadhouse. Everything suspicious I handled with gloves, but in spite of all my precautions, if that poor devil had not appeared last night, this morning I would be a dead man. An ending medical smile curled up the corners of Willowby's eyes. He shifted his position. He glanced in an almost disinterested fashion at the papers tossed about the room. He contrived my murder in the cleverest, most diabolical fashion conceived of by man. Continued more. Knowing that what are the plans I must attach that hose every morning, he carefully saw to it that it was unattached, then using this poison which he had perfected, he placed it on the faucet. So that the instant it came into contact with moisture and metal it became deadly. So deadly that the touch of it on my bare hand was enough to kill me. Fairy pretty said Dwyer was something like a snort, but it strikes me like some kind of a fairy tale. You can't get away with that stuff, young man. More smiled. I saw him placed the poison on the hydrant faucet, so did his wife. I saw the tramp touch it and fall over dead, so to cheat. I've been hunting the formula and his diary. Dwyer sniffed again, though he took the book more extended toward him and turned over its pages curiously. We're always getting dope on mysterious poisons that leave no trace, he said. But it's going a little too far to believe in the existence of one that kills by the mere touch of flesh which has no abrasion or scratch of any kind. Will it be suddenly stiffened? His nostrils quivered. You don't doubt its existence. He exclaimed in a high-pitched, excited voice. I do. You don't believe what he says is true? I do not. Well, it is true, every word of it. The professional pride in the doctor's voice showed he'd clearly forgotten that such a statement meant a admission of murder. Are you confessing that you attempted your brother-in-law's life and killed that hobo? Exclaimed Dwyer whirling on him? I'm making a statement that I've discovered the greatest existing poison that I've proven its potency. You doubt my word, watch. Before any of the startled spectators could stop him, he'd reached for the little of amber-colored liquid, land in so vividly recalled as spilling the night before, and pouring a little of it in a metal measuring cup half filled with water. He rubbed his hand over the surface of the cup. For a second, he smiled whimsically at the men who stared in bewilderment at him. Then he suddenly stiffened. His muscles gave a convulsive movement and he rolled off the chair onto the floor. Dead. Exclaimed the other physician bending over him? Almost instantaneous. While I'm damped, ejaculated Dwyer. My sister, Gast Young Moore, there was a horrified expression in his dark eyes. I must go to her. You don't want me, do you? No, but don't try to get away. Reply Dwyer grimly, still staring in blank astonishment at the stark figure of their late host. You find everything in his diary, said the boy in the doorway, his vain glory prompted him to write it up. It prompted his death, said Lanan, turning away, heart sick at the thought. Then the knowledge that Louise Willaby was free sent him down into the drawing room, where she sat, hands clashed in those of her brother.

Dusk of a summer night. And the tall walls of the commercial heart of an American city of perhaps 400,000 inhabitants, such walls as in time may linger as in your fable. And that the broad street now comparatively hushed a little band of six, a man of about 50, short, stout with bushy hair, protruding from under a round black felt hat, a most unimportant looking person, who carried a small round portable organ, such as as customarily used by street preachers and singers. And with him a woman perhaps five years his junior, taller, not so broad, but solid of frame and vigorous, very plain and face and dress, and yet not home-weep, leading with one hand, small boy of seven, and in the other caring a Bible and several hymn books. With these three, but walking independently behind, was a girl of 15, a boy of 12, and another girl of nine, all following obediently, but not too enthusiasticly in the wake of the others. It was hot, yet with a sweet language about it all. Crossing at right angles, the great thorough fair on which they walked, was a second canyon-like way, threaded by throngs and vehicles and various lines of cars which claimed their bells and made such progress as they might amid swiftly moving streams of traffic. Yet the little groups seem unconscious of anything, save a set purpose to make its way between the contending lines of traffic and pedestrians which flowed by them. Having reached an intersection, this side of the second principal thoroughfare, really just an alley between two tall structures, now quite bear of life of any kind, the man put down his organ, which the woman immediately opened, setting up a music rack upon which she placed a flat-wide hymn book. Then handing the Bible to the man, she fell back and lined with him. While the 12-year-old boy put down a small camp stool in front of the organ. The man, the father, as he chance to be, looked about him with seeming wide-eyed assurance and announced without appearing to care whether he had any auditors or not. We will first sing a hymn of praise so that any whom he wished to acknowledge the Lord may join us. Will you oblige Hester at this the eldest girl who until now had attempted to appear as unconscious and unaffected as possible, bestowed her rather slim and as yet underdeveloped figure upon the camp chair and turn the leaves of the hymn book, pumping the organ well her mother observed. I should think it might be nice to sing 27 tonight. How sweet the volume of Jesus' love. By this time, various homework bound individuals of diverse grades and walks of life, noticing the small group disposing itself in the fashion, hesitated for a moment to either the scant or pause to ascertain the character of their work. This hesitancy can strut by the man apparently to constitute attention, however mobile, was seized upon by him and he began addressing them as though they were specifically here to hear him. What is all sing 27 then? How sweet the volume of Jesus' love. At this the young girl began to interpret the melody upon the organ, emitting a thin, though correct strain. At the same time, joining her rather high soprano without her mother, together with the rather dubious baritone of the father. The other children pipe weakly along, the boy and girl having taken him books from the small pile stacked upon the organ. As they sang, this non-descript and indifferent street audience gazed, held by the peculiarity of such an unimportant looking family, publicly raising its collective voice against the vast skepticism and apathy of life. Some were interested or moved sympathetically by the rather tame and inadequate figure of the girl at the organ, others by the impractical and materially inefficient texture of the father, whose weak blue eyes and rather flabby but poorly clothed figure, to spoke more failure than anything else. Of the group the mother alone stood out as having that force and determination, which, however blind or erroneous, makes for self-preservation if not success in life. She, more than any of the others, stood up with an ignorant yet somehow respectable air of conviction. If you had watched her, her hymnbook dropped to the side, her glance directed straight before her into space, you would have said, well, here is one who, whatever her defects probably does what she believes as nearly as possible. A kind of hard fighting faith in the wisdom and mercy of that definite, overruling and watchful power which she proclaimed was written in her every feature in gesture. The love of Jesus saves me whole, the love of God my steps control. She sang resonantly, if slightly nasally, between the towering walls of the adjacent buildings. The boy moved restlessly from one foot to the other, keeping his eyes down and for the most part only half singing. A tall and as yet slight figures surmounted by an interesting head in face, white skin, dark hair, he seemed more keenly observant and decidedly more sensitive than most of the others, appeared in deep to resent and even to suffer from the position in which she found himself, plainly pagan rather than religious, life interested him. Although as yet he was not fully aware of this, all it could be truly said of him now was that there was no definite appeal in all this for him. He was too young, his mind much too responsive to phases of beauty and pleasure, which had little, if anything, to do with the remote and cloudy romance which swayed the minds of his mother and father. Indeed the home life of which this boy found himself apart and the various contacts, material and psychic, which thus far had been his, did not tend to convince him of the reality and force of all that his mother and father seemed so certainly to believe and say. Rather, they seemed more or less troubled in their lives, at least materially. His father was always reading the Bible and speaking in meeting at different places, especially in the mission which he and his mother conducted not so far from this corner. At the same time, as he understood it, they collected money from various interested or chairedably inclined businessmen here and there, who appeared to believe in such film-thropic work. Yet the family was always hard-up, never very well-closed, and deprived of many comforts and pleasures, which seemed common enough to others. And his father and mother were constantly proclaiming the love and mercy and care of God for him and for all. Plainly there was something wrong somewhere. He could not get it all straight, but still he could not help respecting his mother, a woman who's forced and earnestness, as well as her sweetness appealed to him. Despite much mission work and family cares, she managed to be fairly cheerful, or at least sustaining, often declaring most and fatally, God will provide, or God will show the way, especially in times of two great stress about food or clothes. Yet apparently in spite of this, as he and all the other children could see, God did not show in any very clear way, even though there was always an extreme necessity for his favorable intervention in their affairs. Tonight he'd walk you up the great street with his sisters and brother, he wished that they need not do this anymore, or at least that he need not be part of it. Other boys did not do such things, and besides, somehow it seemed shabby and even degrading. On more than one occasion, before he had been taken on the street in this fashion, other boys had called to him and made fun of his father, because he was always publicly emphasizing his religious beliefs or convictions. Thus, in one neighborhood in which they had lived, when he was about a child of seven, his father, having always polluted every conversation with praise the Lord, he heard boys call, here comes old praised Lord Griffiths, or they would call out after him. Hey, you're the fellow who sister plays the organ. Is there anything else she can play? What does he always want to do going around saying praise the Lord for? Other people don't do it. It was that old mass yearning for a likeness and all things that troubled them and him. Neither his father nor his mother was like other people, because they were always making so much of religion, and now it lasts, they were making a business of it. On this night in this great street with its cars and crowds and tall buildings, he felt ashamed, dragged out of normal life to be made a show ingest of. The handsome automobiles that spread by balloonering pedestrians moving off to what interests and comforts he could only surmise, the gay pairs of young people laughing and gesting and the kids staring, I'll troubled him with a sense of something different. Something better, more beautiful than his, or rather their life. And now units of this vagram and unstable street throng, which was forever shifting and changing about them, seem to sense the psychological error of all this, and so far as these children were concerned. For they would not join another, the more sophisticated and indifferent lifting an eyebrow and smiling contemptuously, the more sympathetic or experienced, commenting on the useless presence of these children. I see these people around here nearly every night now, two or three times a week anyhow, this from a young clerk who had just met his girl and was escorting her toward a restaurant. They're just working some religious dodge or other, I guess. That old-est boy don't want to be here, he feels out of place, I can see that. It ain't right to make a kid like that come out unless he wants to. He can't understand all this stuff anyhow. This from an idler and lo-for of about 40, one of those odd hangers on about the commercial heart of a city, addressing a pausing and seemingly amiable stranger. Yeah, I guess that's so, the other ascended, taking in the peculiar cast of the boys' head and face, and view of the uneasy and self-conscious expression upon the face whenever it was lifted, one might have intelligently suggested that it was a little unkind, as well as idle, to thus publicly force upon a temperament as yet unfitted to absorb their import, religious and psychic services best suited to reflective temperaments of mature years. Yet so it was. As for the remainder of the family, both the youngest girl and boy were too small to really understand much of what it was all about or to care. The eldest girl of the ordinate appeared not so much to mind as to enjoy the attention and comment her presence in singing evoked. For more than once, not only strangers, but her mother and father, had assured her that she had an appealing and compelling voice, which was only partially true. It was not a good voice, they did not really understand music. Physically, she was of a pale and masculine and unimportant structure, with no real mental force or death, and was easily made to feel that this was an excellent field in which to distinguish herself and attract a little attention. As for the parents, they were determined upon spiritualizing the world as much as possible. And once the him was concluded, the father launched into one of those hackney descriptions of the delights of her lease via self-realization of the mercy of God and the love of Christ and the will of God towards sinners, from the burdens and cares of evil conscience. All men are sinners in the light of the Lord, he declared, unless they repent unless they accept Christ, his well-being forgiveness of them, they can never know the happiness of being spiritually whole and clean. Oh, my friends, if you could but know the peace and content that comes with the knowledge, the inward understanding that Christ lived and died for you and that he walks with you every day and hour by light and by dark, at dawn and at dusk to keep and strengthen you for the tasks and cares of the world that are ever before you. Oh, the snares and pitfalls that be set us all, and then the soothing realization that Christ is ever with us to counsel, to aid, to hurting, to bind up our wounds and make us whole. Oh, the peace, the satisfaction, the comfort, the glory of that. Amen, a separated his wife and the daughter, Hester, or Esta, as she was called by the family, moved by the need of as much public support as possible for all of them, echoed it after her. Clyde, the eldest boy and the two younger children merely gazed at the ground, or occasionally at their father, with a feeling that possibly it was all true and important, yet somehow not a significant or inviting as some of the other things which life held. They heard so much of this, and to their young and eager minds, life was made for something more than street and mission hall protestations of the sort. Finally, after a second him and an address by Mrs. Griffiths, during which she took occasion to refer to the mission work jointly conducted by them in a nearby street, and their services for the cause of Christ in general, a third him was indulged in. And then some tracks describing the mission rescue work being distributed, such voluntary gifts as were forthcoming were taken up by Esta, the father. The small organ was closed, the camp chair folded up and given to Clyde, the Bible and him books picked up by Mrs. Griffiths, and with the organ supported by a leather strap passed over the shoulder of Griffith's senior, the mission word March was taken up. During all this time, Clyde was saying to himself that he did not wish to do this anymore, that he and his parents looked foolish unless the normal. Cheek was the word he would have used if he could have brought himself to express his full measure of resentment, at being compelled to participate in this way, and that he would not do it anymore if he could help. What good did it do to have him along? His life should not be like this. Other boys did not have to do as he did. He meditated now more determinedly than ever, a rebellion by which he would rid himself of the need of going out in this way. One his elder sister go of she chose, she liked it, his younger sister and brother might be too young to care, but he, they seemed a little more attentive than usual tonight, I thought, commented Griffiths to his wife as they walked along, the seductive quality of the summer evening air softening him into a more generous interpretation of the customary indifferent spirit of the passerby. Yes, 27 took tracks tonight as against 18 on Thursday. The love of Christ must eventually prevail, comforted the father, as much to hearten himself as his wife. The pleasures and cares of the world hold a very great many, but when sorrow overtakes them, then some of these seeds will take root. I am sure of it. That is the thought which always keeps me up. Sorrow and the weight of sin eventually bring some of them to see the error of their way. They now entered into the narrow side street from which they had emerged, and walking as many as a dozen doors from the corner entered the door of a yellow single story wooden building. The large window in two glass panes in the central door of which had been painted a gray white. Across both windows and the smaller panels in the double door had been painted. The door of hope, Bethel independent mission, meetings every Wednesday and Saturday night 8 to 10, Sundays at 11, 3 and 8, everybody welcome. Under this legend on each window were printed the words, God is love, and below this again in smaller type, how long since you wrote to mother, the small company entered the yellow on prepossessing door and disappeared.

Book 2, Chapter 39. Opposing views such as these, especially where no real skill to meet such a situation existed, could only spell greater difficulty and even eventual disaster unless chance in some form should aid. And chance did not aid. And the presence of Roberta and the factory was something that would not permit him to dismiss it from his mind. If only he could persuade or relieve and go somewhere else to live and work, so that you should not always see her, he might then think more calmly. For with her asking continuously by her presence, if no more, what he intended to do, it was impossible for him to think. And the fact that he no longer cared for her as he had tended to reduce his normal consideration of what was her due, he was too infatuated with, and hence disarranged by his thoughts of Sandra. For in the very teeth of this grave dilemma, he continued to pursue the enticing dream in connection with Sandra, the dark situation connection with Roberta seeming no more at moments than a dark cloud which shadowed this other. And hence nightly, or as often as the exigency is of his still unbroken connection with Roberta would permit, he was availing himself with such opportunities as his flourishing connections now afforded. Now, into his great pride and satisfaction, it was a dinner at the Harriet's or tailors to which he was invited, or a party at the Finchlees or the Cranstins to which he could either as Scortesandra or be animated by the hope of encountering her. And now, also without so many of the former phases or attempts at subtrefuge, which had previously characterized her geriosy and regard to him, she was at times openly seeking him out and making opportunities for social contact. And of course, these contacts being identical with this typical kind of group gathering, they seem to have no special significance with the more conservative elders. For although Mrs. Finchle, who was of an especially shrewd and discerning turn socially, had at first been dubious over the attentions being showered upon Clyde by her daughter and others, still observing that Clyde was more and more being entertained, not only in her own home by the group of which her daughter was a part, but elsewhere, everywhere. Was it last inclined to imagine that he must be more solidly placed in this world than she had heard, and later to ask her son and even Sandra concerning him. But receiving from Sandra only the equivocal information that, since he was gill and bell a Griffith's cousin, and was being taken up by everybody because he was so charming, even if he didn't have any money, she couldn't see why she and Stewart should not be allowed to entertain him also. Her mother rested on that for the time being, only cautioning her daughter under no circumstances to become too friendly. And Sandra, realizing that in part her mother was right, yet being so drawn to Clyde, was now determined to deceive her, at least the extent of being as clandestinely free with Clyde as she could contrive. And was, so much so that everyone who is privy to the intimate contacts between Clyde and Sandra might have reported that the actual understanding between them was assuming an intensity which was certainly what have shocked the elder Finchlees could they have known. For a part from what Clyde had been and still was dreaming in regard to her, Sandra was truly being taken with thoughts and moods in regard to him, which were fast-verging upon the most destroying aspects of the very profound chemistry of love. Indeed, in addition to hand-classes, kisses and looks of intense admiration always bestowed when presumably no one was looking, there were those nebulous and yet strengthening and lengthening fantasies concerning a future which in some way or other, not clear to either as yet, was still always to include each other. Some are days perhaps, and that soon in which she and she would be in a canoe at 12th lake, and long shadows of the trees on the bank lengthening over the silvery water, the wind rippling the surface while he paddled and she idled and tortured him with hints of the future, a certain forest path, grass-saud and and sun modeled to the south and west of the cramped and in the fant of states near theirs, through which they might canter in June and July, to a wonderful view known as inspiration point some seven miles west. The county fair at Sharon, at which in a gypsy costume the essence of romance itself should super intend to booth, or in her smartest writing habit, given exhibition of her horsemanship, tease dances in the afternoon, and in the moonlight at which languishing in his arms their eyes would speak. None of the compulsion of the practical, none of the inhibitions which the dominance and possible few drop position of her parents might imply, just love and summer and idyllic and happy progress toward an eventual secure and unopposed union which would give him to her forever. And in the meantime, insofar as Roberto was concerned, two more long, dreary, terrifying months going by without that mediated action on her part, which must result once it was taken in Clydes undoing. For as convinced as she was that a part from meditating and thinking of some way to escape his responsibility, Clyde had no real intention of marrying her. Still, like Clyde, she drifted, fearing to act really. For in several conferences following that in which she had indicated that she expected him to marry her, he had reiterated if vaguely, a veiled threat that in case she appealed to his uncle, he would not be compelled to marry her, after all, for he could go elsewhere. The way he put it was that, unless left undisturbed in his present situation, he would be a no position to marry her, and furthermore could not possibly do anything to aid her at the coming time, when most of all she would stand in need of aid, a hint which caused Roberta to reflect on a hither to not fully developed vein of hardness and Clyde, although she had but sufficiently reflected, it had chown itself at the time that he compelled her to admit him to her room. In addition, and because she was doing nothing, and yet he feared that at any moment she might, he shifted in part at least from the attitude of complete indifference, which had availed him up to the time that she had threatened him, to one of at least simulated interest and goodwill and friendship. For the very precarious condition in which he found himself was sufficiently terrifying, to evoke more diplomacy than ever before had characterized him. Besides, he was foolish enough to hope, if not exactly, that by once more conducting himself as though he still entertained the lively sense of the problem that afflicted her, and that he was willing, in case no other way was found, to eventually marry her, though he could never definitely be persuaded to commit himself as to this, he could reduce her determination to compel him to act soon, at least to a minimum, and so leave him more time in which to exhaust every possibility of escape without marriage, and without being compelled to run away. And although Roberto sent the basis of this sudden shift, she was still so utterly alone in the street that she was willing to give ear to Clyde's mock genial, if not exactly affectionate observations and suggestions. It caused her at his behest to wait a while longer, the while, as he now explained, he would not only have saved up some money, but devised some plan in connection with his work, which would permit him to leave for a time anyhow, marry her somewhere, and then establish her in the baby as a wawful married woman somewhere else. While, although he did not explain this just now, he returned to Lycurges and sent her such aid as he could. But on the condition of course that never anywhere, unless he gave her permission, must she assert that he had married her, or point to him in any way as the father of her child. Also it was understood that she, as she herself had asserted over and over that she would, if only he would do this, marry her, take steps to free herself on the ground of desertion or something, in some place sufficiently removed from Lycurges for no one to hear, and that within a reasonable time after her marriage to him, although he was not at all satisfied that assuming he did marry her, she would. But Clyde, of course, was incency or in regard to all his overtures at this time, and really not concerned as to her sincerity or insincerity. Nor did he have any intention of leaving Lycurges, even for the moderate length of time that her present extrication were required, unless he had to. For that meant that he would be separated from Sandra, and such absence for whatever period would most definitely interfere with his plans. And so on the contrary he drifted, thinking most idly at times of some possible fake or mock marriage that she had seen in some melodramatic movie, a fake minister and witnesses combined to deceive some simple country girls such as Roberto was not, but at such expensive time, resources, courage, and subtlety as Clyde himself after a little reflection was wise enough to see was beyond him. Again, knowing that, unless some hithered to unforeseen age should eventually, he was heading straight toward a disaster which could not much longer be obviated. He even allowed himself to dream that once the fatal hour was at hand and Roberto, no longer to be put off by any form of subterfuge, was about to expose him, he might even flat what he denied that he had ever held any such relationship with her as then she would be charging, rather that at all times his relationship with her had been that of a department manager to employ you. No more. Terror. No less. But at the same time, early in May, when Roberto, because of various just state of science and ailments, was beginning to explain, as well as insist, to Clyde that by no stretch of the imagination or courage could she be expected to retain her position at the factory, or work later than June 1st, because by then likely, he would have the girls there beginning to notice something would be too great for her to endure. Sondra was beginning to explain that not so much later than the 4th or 5th of June, she and her mother and Stewart, together with some servants, would be going to their new logic, 12th lake, in order to supervise certain installations, then being made before the regular season should begin. And after that, not later than the 8th, at which time the crannstins, heriards and some others would have arrived, including very likely visits from Bella and Maira, he might expect a weekend invitation from the crannstins, with whom, through Bertine, she would arrange as to this. And after that, the general circumstances proving fairly perpetuous, there would be, of course, other weekend invitations to the Harriet's, fans and some others who do all there, as well as to the Griffiths that Greenwood, to which place, on account of Bella, he could easily come. And during his two weeks vacation in July, he could either stop at the casino, which was at Pine Point, or perhaps the crannstins or Harriet's, at her suggestion, might choose to invite him. At any rate, as Clyde could see, and with no more than such expenditures, as, with a little squimping during his ordinary working days here, he could provide for it. He might see not a little of that lake life, which he had read so much in local papers, to say nothing of Sondra at one and another of the lodges. The masters of which were not so inimical to his presence and overtures as were Sondra's parents. For now it was, and for the first time, as she proceeded to explain to him, that her mother and father, because of his continued and reported attractions to her, were already beginning to talk of an extended European tour, which might keep her and Stewart and her mother abroad for at least the next two years. But since, at news of this, Clyde's face, as well as his spirits darkened, and she herself was sufficiently enmeshed to suffer because of this, she at once added that he must not feel so bad. He must not. Things would work out well enough, she knew. For at the proper time, and then, less between then and now, something, her own subtle attack, if not her, at present, feverish, interest, and Clyde, should have worked to alter her mother's viewpoint and regard to him. She might be compelled to take some steps of her own in order to frustrate her mother. Just what she was not willing to say at this time, although to Clyde's overheated imagination, it took the form of an allotment and marriage, which could not then be gained said by her parents, whatever they might think. And it was true that an in a vague and as yet repressed way, some such thought was beginning to form in Saunders' mind. For, as she now proceeded to explain to Clyde, it was so plain that her mother was attempting to steer her in the direction of a purely social match, the one with the youth who had been paying her such market attention the year before. But because of her present passion for Clyde, as she now gazed at Clyde, it was not easy to see how she was to be made to comply. The only trouble with me is that I'm not a avid yet, she here added brisk-queen slingly. They've gone me there, of course, but I will be by next October, and they can't do very much with me after that, I want to let you know. I can marry the person I want, I guess. And if I can't do it here, well, there are more ways than one to kill a cat. The thought was like some sweet disarranging poison to Clyde, it fevered and all but betrayed him mentally. If only, if only, it were not for a burden now, that terrifying and all-but-insoluble problem. But for that, and the opposition of Saunders' parents, which she was thinking she would be able to overcome, did not have in itself await him? Saundera, 12th Lake, Society, Wealth, her love and beauty. He grew not a little wild in thinking of it all. Once he and she were married, what could Saunders' relatives do? What, but actually, yes, and take them into the glorious bosom of their respondent home at Lyker-guess, or provide for them in some other way, he to know down eventually take some place in connection with the Finchley Electric sweeper company. And then would he not be the equal, if not the superior of Gilbert Griffiths himself, and all those others who had originally ignored him here, join air with Stewart to all the Finchley means. And with Saundera as the central or crowning jewel to so much sudden and such Aladdin-like splendor. No thought as to how he was to overcome the time between now and October, no serious consideration of the fact that Roberta then and there was demanding that he marry her. He could put her off, he thought. And yet, at the same time, he was painfully and nervously conscious of the fact that it no period in his life before had he been so treacherously poised at the very brink of disaster. It might be his duty as the world would see it, his mother would say so, to at least extortate Roberta. But in the case of Esther, who had come to her rescue, her lover, he had walked off from her without a quorum and she had not died. And why, when Roberta was nowhere soft than his sister had been, why should she seek to destroy him in this way? Forcing to do something which would be little less than social, artistic, passionate or emotional assassination, and went later, if she would but spare him for this, he could do much more for her, with Saundera's money of course. He could not and would not let her do this to him. His life would be ruined and a book to chapter 39.","Crime & Mystery Fiction, Romance",English,15:20:16,Tatiana Chichilla,"['American', 'Cranstins', 'European']","['Finchlees', 'Tatiana Chichilla', 'Griffiths', 'Maira', 'Clyde', 'Esther', 'Sandra', 'Finchle', 'Greenwood', 'Theodore Dreyzer', 'Roberto', 'Gilbert Griffiths', 'Roberta', 'Harriet', 'Sondra', 'Saundera', 'Stewart', 'Saunders', 'Scortesandra']","['Sondra', 'Lycurges', 'Clydes', 'Roberta', 'Clyde']",[],0,0,0,0,10,7,0
The Great Gatsby (version 2),F. Scott Fitzgerald,114414,9.0,"September 8, 2021",[],0,".org. Recording by Adrian J. Wilson, Lillham England. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Chapter 1 The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. Whenever you feel like criticising anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had. He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. I habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran boards. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person. And so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild unknown men. Most of the confidence is were unsought. Frequently I have fain's sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity, when I realised, by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon. For the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and mired by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, a nice snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decences is pastled out unequally at birth. And after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point, I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from the east last autumn, I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform, and a sort of moral attention forever. I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction. Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life. As if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes, 10,000 miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability, which is dignified under the name of the creative temperament. It was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic reddeness, such as I've never found in any other person, and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No. Gatsby turned out all right at the end. It is what prayed on Gatsby. What foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams. The temperairely closed out my interest, in the abortive sorrows, and short winded relations of men. My family have been prominent well to do people in this middle-western city for three generations. The carerways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we're descended from the dukes of Bacleur, that the actual found of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in 51. Centre substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. I never saw this great uncle, but I'm supposed to look like him, with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father. And a little later I participated in that delayed, tutonic migration, known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counterade so thoroughly that I came back restless, instead of being the warm centre of the world, the middle-west now seemed like the racket edge of the universe. So I decided to go east and learn the bond business. What he and you was in the bond business, so I suppose it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, why, yes, with very grave hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came east permanently, I thought, in the spring of 22. The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide-lawns and friendlitries, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at 80 a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered into Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old dodge, and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast, and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself, over the electric stove. He was lonely for a day or so, until one morning, some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. How do you get to West Egg Village, she asked helplessly? I told him, and as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood, and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down, out of the young breath giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secret that only might ason Morgan and my seen as new. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college. One year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale news. And now I was going back to bring back all such things into my life, and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This isn't just an epigram. Life is much more successfully looked at for a single window after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself to east of New York, and where there are among other natural curiosities to unusual formations of land, 20 miles from the city, a pair of enormous eggs. Identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of saltwater in the western hemisphere. The great wet barnyard of Long Island sound. They are not perfect ovals, like the egg in the Columbus story. They are both crushed flat at the contact end, but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the goals that fly overhead. To the wingless, a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the, well the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only 50 yards from the sound and squeezed between two huge places that rented for 12 or 15,000 a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. It was a factual imitation of some hotel reveal, in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new and worth in beard of raw ivy, an immobile swimming pool, and more than 40 acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion. Or rather, as I didn't know Mr Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an isor, but it was a small isor and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of 1,000,000 billionaires, all for $80 a month. Across the courtesy bay, the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanan's. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I had known Tom in college, and just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football in New Haven. A national figure in a way, one of those men who reached such an acute, limited excellence at 21, that everything after, save as of anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy. Even in college is freedom with money was a matter for approach, but now he left Chicago and come east, in a fashion that rather took your breath away, for instance he'd brought down a string of polo-pone is from Lake Forest. It was hard to realise that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that. Why they came east I don't know. That spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there, unrestfully, wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy of the telephone. But I didn't believe it. I had no sight in today's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever, seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game. So it happened that on a warm windy evening, I drove over to East Ed to see two old friends who my scarce knew at all. The house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over some dials and brick walks and burning gardens. Finally, when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines, as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, blowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm wind the afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing, with his legs apart on the front porch. He had changed into new haven years, now he was a sturdy, straw-head man of 30, with a rather hard mouth and a super-thcillious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. But even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body, he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top-lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when he sheld a move under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage, a cruel body. His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked, and the women at new haven who had hated his guts. Now don't think my opinion on these matters is final, he seemed to say, just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are. We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate, I always had the impression that he approved of me, and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant, whisperednessed of his own. We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. I've got a nice place here he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly. Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat handle on the front-fista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub nose motorboat that bumped the tide offshore. We belonged to domain, the oilman, he turned me round again, politely and abruptly, will go inside. We walked through a high hallway into a bright, rosy colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were a jar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room. Blue curtains in at one end and out the other, like pale flanks, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as windows on the sea. The only complete listation we object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up, as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering, as if they'd just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains, and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows, and the court wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rucks and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor. The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with a chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes, she gave no hint of it. Indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology of having disturbed her by coming in. The other girl Daisy made an attempt to rise. She leans slightly forward with a conchianchus expression, and she laughed and observed charming with the laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room. I'm paralyzed with happiness. She laughed again as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward her, and a relevant criticism that made it no less charming. At any rate, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and they quickly tipped her head back again. The object she was balancing had obviously taught her a little, and given her something of a fright. A gain a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. I look back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in a low-thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sab and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget. A singing compulsion, a whispered, listened, a promise that she had done gay, exciting things, just a while since, and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour. I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east, and how it doesn't people had sent their love through me. Do they miss me? She cried ecstatically. The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a morning wreath, and there's a persistent whale all night along the north shore. How gorgeous! Let's go back to home tomorrow, then she added irrelevantly. You ought to see the baby. I'd like to. She's asleep. She's three years old, haven't you ever seen her? Never. Well, you ought to see her. She's tomb your cannon who had been hovering restlessly about the room. Stopped and rested as hand on my shoulder. What you doing, Nick? I'm a bond man. Who with? I told him. Never heard of them. He remarked decisively. This annoyed me. You will, I answered shortly. You will, if you stay in the east. Oh, I'll stay in the east. Don't you worry. He said, glancing at Daisy, and then back at me, as if you were alert for something more, I'd be a goddamn fool to live anywhere else. At this point, Miss Baker said, absolutely, with such suddenness that I started, it was the first word she'd uttered since I came into the room. Evidently, it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yorned, and with a series of rapid death movements stood up into the room. I'm stiff she complained. I'd been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember. Don't look at me Daisy retorted. I'd been trying to get you to new york all afternoon. Oh, thanks, Ed Miss Baker, to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. I'm absolutely in training. Her host looked at her incredulously. You are. He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. How you ever get anything done is beyond me. I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she, got done. I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small, breasted girl with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders, like a young cadet. Her grace on strained eyes looked back at me with polite, reciprocal curiosity, out of a one charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her or a picture of her somewhere before. You live in West Egg, she remark contemptuously. I know somebody there. I don't know a single, you must know Gatsby. Gatsby demanded Daisy, what Gatsby? Before I could reply that he was my neighbour, dinner was announced, wedging his tents arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though we were moving a checker to another square. Slandly, languidly, the handset lightly on their hips, the two young women proceeded as out onto a rosy-colored porch, open towards the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. Why can't laws objected Daisy frowning? She snapped them out with her fingers. In two weeks it will be the longest day in the year. She looked at her as well, radiantly. Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it. We ought to plan something, you're on missbaker sitting down at the table, as if she were getting into bed. All right, said Daisy, what will we plan? She turned to me helplessly. What do people plan? Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an award expression on her little finger. Look, she complained, I hurt it. We all looked, the knuckle was black and blue. You did it, Tom, she said accusingly. I know you didn't mean to, but you did do it. That's what I get from marrying a broot of a man, a great big, hulking, physical specimen, ever. I hate that word hulking, objected Tom crossly, even in kidding. Hulking insisted Daisy. Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively, and with a bantering in consequence that was never quite chatter, there was as cool as their white dresses and their in-person lies in the absence of all desire. They were here and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over, and a little later, the evening too would be over, and casually put away. It was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation, or else in sheer nervous dread at the moment itself. You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy, I can first, on my second glass of corkie, but rather impressive, Clarett. Can't you talk about crops or something? I met nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way. Civilizations going to pieces, broke out Tom violently, I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read the rise of the colored empires by this man God-ad? Why no, I answered, rather surprised by his tone. Well, it's a fine book and everybody ought to read it. The idea is, we don't look out. The white race will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff. It's been proved. Tom's getting very profound, said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we? Well, these books are all scientific insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out, or these other races will have control of things. We've got to beat them down, whispered Daisy, winking for rociously towards a fervent sun. You ought to live in California began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair. This idea is that we're Nordics. I am and you are and you are and after an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod and she went at me again and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization. Oh, science and art and all that, do you see? There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more acute than a old was not enough to him anymore. When almost immediately the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch, Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me. I'll tell you a family secret she whispered enthusiastically. It's about the butlers nose. Do you want to hear about the butlers nose? That's why I came over tonight. Well, he wasn't always a butler. He used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for 200 people. He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose. Things went from bad to worse, suggested Miss Baker. Yes, things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position. For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face. Her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened. Then the glow faded, each light desertting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear, where upon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again. A voice glowing and singing, I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn't he? She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation. An absolute rose? This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporising, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if a heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house. Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance, consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said, shh, in a warning voice. Subdued in passion murmur was audible in the room beyond. Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly and then ceased altogether. This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour, I said, don't talk, I want to hear what happens. Is something happening? I inquired innocently. You mean to say you don't know said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. I thought everybody knew. I don't. Why? She said hesitantly, Tom's got some woman in New York. Got some woman, I repeated blankly. Miss Baker nodded. She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time, don't you think? Or most before I had grasped her meaning. There was the flutter of address and the crunch of leather boots. And Tom and Daisy were back at the table. It couldn't be helped, cried Daisy with tense guillity. She sat down glancing searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued. I looked out doors for a minute and is very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale. Come over on the Koonar or white starline. He's singing away, her voice sang, it's romantic isn't it Tom? Very romantic he said. And then miserably to me, it's light enough after dinner. I want to take you down to the stables. The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom, the subject of the stables. In fact all subjects vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table, I remember the candles being lit again pointlessly. And I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt it even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain. Hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guests shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing. My own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police. The horses need us to say we're not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body while trying to look pleasantly interested in a little death. I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting veranders to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down, side by side on a wicker city. Daisy took a face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. We don't know each other very well Nick, she said certainly. Even if we are cousins, you didn't come to my wedding. I wasn't back from the war. That's true, she hesitated. Well I've had a very bad time Nick and I'm pretty cynical about everything. Evidently she had reason to be. I waited, but she didn't say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. I suppose she talks and eats and everything. Oh yes, she looked at me absolutely. Listen Nick, let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear? Very much. It will show you how I've gotten to feel about things. She was less than an hour old, and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. All right, I said, I'm glad it's a girl, and I hope she'll be a fool. That's the best thing a girl can be in this will. A beautiful little fool. You see, I think everything's terrible anyhow, she went on in a convinced way. Everybody thinks so. The most advanced people, and I know. I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything. Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's and she laughed with thrilling scorn, sophisticated, god-imbs sophisticated. The instant her voice broke off, seizing to compel my attention, my belief. I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited. I'd sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smurcon I lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged. Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch, and she read aloud to him from the Saturday evening post. The words murmurous and uninflicted, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight bright on his boots and dull on the autumn leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper, as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms. When we came in, she held a silent for a moment with a lifted hand. To be continued, she said, tossing the magazine on the table in her very next issue. Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee and she stood up. Ten o'clock she remarked apparently finding the time on the ceiling. Time for this good girl to go to bed. Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow explained Daisy, over at Westchester. Oh, your Jordan Baker. I knew now why her face was familiar. It's pleasing contemptuous expression that looked out of me, for many rotagrevia pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and hot springs in Palm Beach. I had heard some story of hers too, a critical and pleasant story, but what it was I'd forgotten long ago. Good night she said softly, wait me at eight won't you. If you'll get up, I will. Good night, Mr. Carroway. See you and on. Of course you will confirm Daisy. In fact, I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of, oh, fling you together. You know, lock you up accidentally and lint and closet and push you out to see in a boat, and all that sort of thing. Good night, call Ms Baker from the stairs. I haven't heard a word. She's a nice girl, said Tom after a moment. They oughtn't to let her run around the country this way. Who oughtn't to, and quiet Daisy coldly? Her family. Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's going to look after her. On you, Nick. She's gone to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her. Daisy and Tom look to each other for a moment in silence. Is she from New York, I ask quickly? From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white. Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda? Demanded Tom suddenly? Did I? She looked at me? I can't seem to remember. But I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It's sort of crept upon us. And first thing you know, don't believe everything you hear Nick he advised me. I said lightly that I'd heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. The came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor, Daisy Perempta really called, wait. I've got to ask you something and it's important. We heard you are engaged to a girl out west. That's right corroborated Tom kindly. We heard the you were engaged. It's a libel. I'm too poor. But we heard it insisted Daisy surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. We heard it from three people so it must be true. Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the bands was one of the reasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on account of rumors. And on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage. Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich. Nevertheless I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms, but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom the fact that he had some woman in New York was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas, as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his paramptory heart. Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, when you read gas pumps set out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg, I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees, and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat waver across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone. Fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion, and was standing with his hands and his pockets, regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements, and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn, suggested that it was missed to get to be himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens. I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him, for he gave a sudden intemation that he was content to be alone. He stretched out his arms towards the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. In voluntarily I glanced seaweed, and distinguished nothing except a single green light, my nude and far away, that might have been the end of a dog. When I looked once more for Gatsby, he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness, and of chapter 1.",Published 1900 onward,English,05:01:29,afinevoice,"['Finnish', 'French', 'Georgian', 'Italian']","['Daisy', 'Lillham England', 'Ms Baker', 'Gatsby', 'Tom', 'Tom Buchanan', 'Daisy Perempta', 'Jordan Baker', 'Normandy', 'Only Gatsby', 'Miss Baker', 'Jordan', 'Listen Nick', 'Clarett', 'F.

There were two important things. One that she was very old. Two that Mr. Thurko was taking her to God. For hadn't he padded her hand and said, Mrs. Bellows, will take off into space in my rocket and go to find him together. And that was how it was going to be. Oh, this wasn't like any other group Mrs. Bellows had ever joined. In her furvert to lay to path for her delicate, tottering feet, she had struck matches down dark alleys and found her way to Hindu mystics who floated their flickering, starry eyelashes over crystal balls. She had walked on the metal pass with a set of Indian philosophers, imported by daughters and spirit of Madame Blavatsky. She had made pilgrimages to California's stucco jungles to hunt the astrological seer in his natural habitat. She had even consented to signing away the rights to one of her homes. In order to be taken into the shouting order of a temple of amazing evangelists, would promise her gold smoke, crystal fire, and the great soft hand of God coming to bear her home. None of these people had ever shaken Mrs. Bellows' faith, even when she saw them siren away in a black wagon in the night or discovered their pictures bleak in unromantic in the morning tablets. The world had roughed them up and locked them away because they knew too much that was all. And then two weeks ago, she had seen Mr. Turkel's advertisement in New York City. From tomorrow's, stay at the Turkel Restorium for one week, then on into space on the greatest adventure life can offer. Send for free pamphlet. Near in my God to thee, excursion rates, round trips slightly lower. Round trip Mrs. Bellows had thought, but who would come back after seeing him? And so she had bought a ticket and flown off to Mars and spent seven mild days at Mr. Turkel's Restorium, the building with the sign on it which flashed, Turkel's rocket to heaven. She had spent the week bathing in limpy waters and erasing the care from her tiny bones, and now she was fidgeting, ready to be loaded into Mr. Turkel's own special private rocket, like a bullet, to be fired on out into space beyond Jupiter and Saturn and Pluto. And thus, who could deny it, you would be getting near and near to the Lord. Wonderful, couldn't you just feel him drawing near? Couldn't you just sense his breath, his scrutiny, his presence? Here I am, said Mrs. Bellows, an ancient rickety elevator ready to go up the shaft, God need only press the button. Now on the seventh day, as she minced up the steps of the Restorium, a number of small doubts assailed her. For one thing, she said aloud to no one. It isn't quite the land of milk and honey here on Mars that they said it would be. My room is like a cell, the swimming pool is really quite inadequate, and besides, how many widows who look like mushrooms or skeletons want to swim. And finally, the whole Restorium smells of boiled cabbage and tennis shoes. She opened the front door and let it slam, somewhat irritably. She was amazed at the other women in the auditorium. It was like wandering into a carnival mirror maze, coming again and again upon yourself. The same flowery face, the same chicken hands, and jingling bracelets. One after another, the images of herself floated before her. She put out her hand, but it wasn't a mirror. It was another lady shaking her fingers and saying, we're waiting for Mr. Thurkul. Shhh. Ah, whispered everyone. The velvet curtains parted. Mr. Thurkul appeared fantastically serene. His Egyptian eyes upon everyone. But there was something nevertheless, and is appearance, which made one expect him to call high, while fuzzy dogs jumped over his legs, through his hoop dimes and over his back. Then, dogs and all, he should dance with a dazzling piano keyboard, smile off into the wings. Mrs. Bellows, with a secret part of her mind which he constantly had to grip tightly, expected to hear a cheap Chinese gong sound when Mr. Thurkul entered. Large liquid dark eyes were so improbable that one of the old ladies had fissies just sleak claims she saw a mosquito cloud hovering over them as they did around summer rain barrels. And Mrs. Bellows, sometimes caught the scent of the theatrical mothball and the smell of collale pisteam on his sharply pressed suit. But with the same savage rationalization that had greeted all other disappointments in her rickety life, she bit at the suspicion and whispered, this time it's real, this time it'll work. Haven't we got a rocket? Mr. Thurkul bowed, he smiled the sudden comedy mass smile. The old ladies looked in at his epiglottis and sense chaos there. Before he even began to speak, Mrs. Bellows saw him picking up each of his words, oiling it, making sure it ran smooth on its rails. Her heart squeezed in like a tiny fist and she gritted her porcelain teeth. Friends said Mr. Thurkul, and you could hear the frost nap in the hearts of the entire assemblage. No, said Mrs. Bellows ahead of time, she could hear the bad news rushing out her, and herself tied to the track while the immense black wheels threatened in the whistle-screened helpless. There will be a slight delay, said Mr. Thurkul. In the next instant, Mr. Thurkul might have cried, or been tempted to cry, ladies be seated in menstrual fashion. For the ladies had come up at him from their chairs, protesting and trembling. Not a very long delay, Mr. Thurkul put up his hands to pat the air. How long? Only a week. A week. Yes, you can stay here at the rest of the story for seven more days. Can't you? A little delay won't matter. Will it? In the end, you waited a lifetime, only a few more days. At $20 a day, thought Mrs. Bellows coldly. What's the trouble, a woman cried? A legal difficulty, said Mr. Thurkul. We've a rocket, haven't we? Well, yet, S. But I've been here a whole month, waiting said one old lady. Delays delayed. That's right, said everyone. Ladies, ladies, my ridd Mr. Thurkul smiling serienly. We want to see the rocket. It was Mrs. Bellows forging ahead alone, brandishing her fist like a toy hammer. Mr. Thurkul looked into the old lady's eyes, a missionary among Albino cannibals. Well, now he said, yes, now cried Mrs. Bellows. I'm afraid he began. So am I, she said. That's why we want to see the ship. Oh, no, now Mrs. He snapped as fingers for her name. Bellows, she cried. She was a small container, but now all the seething pressure that had been built up over long years came steaming through the delicate vents of her body. Her cheeks became incandescent. With a whale that was like a melancholy factory whistle, Mrs. Bellows ran forward and hung to him, almost by her teeth, like a summer man in spits. She would not and never could let go until he died. And the other women followed, jumping and yapping like a pound let loose on its trainer. The same one who had petted them into whom they had squirmed in wine joyfully an hour before, now milling about him, creasing his sleeves and frightening the Egyptian serenity from his gaze. This way, cried Mrs. Bellows, feeling like Madame Lefarge through the back, we've waited long enough to see the ship. Every day he's put us off, every day we've waited. Now let's see. No, no ladies cried, Mr. Thircle, leaping about. They burst through the back of the stage and out of door, like a flood, bearing the poor man with them into a shed, and then out, quite suddenly, into an abandoned gymnasium. There it is, someone said, the rocket. And then a silent spell that was terrible to entertain, there was the rocket. Mrs. Bellows looked at it in her hands sagged away from Mr. Thircle's collar. The rocket was something like a battered copper pot. There was a thousand bulges and rents and rusty pipes and dirty vents on and in it. The ports were clotted over with dust, resembling the eyes of a blind hog. Everyone wailed a little sign whale. Is that the rocket ship, glory be to the highest? Cried Mrs. Bellows, appalled? Mr. Thircle nodded and looked at his feet through which we paid out our $1,000 a piece and came all the way to Mars to get on board with you and go off to find him. Ask Mrs. Bellows. Why that isn't worth the sack of dry peas, said Mrs. Bellows. It's nothing but junk. junk whispered everyone, getting hysterical. Don't let him get away. Mr. Thircle tried to break and run, but a thousand possum traps closed on him from every side. He withered. Everybody walked around in circles like blind mice. There was a confusion in a weeping that lasted for five minutes as they went over and touched the rocket, the dented kettle, the rusty container for gods children. Well, said Mrs. Bellows. She stepped up into the escue doorway of the rocket and faced everyone. It looks as if a terrible thing has been done to us, she said. I haven't any money to go back home to earth and I've too much pride to go to the government until them at common man like this has fooled us out of our life savings. I don't know how you feel about it, all of you, but the reason all of us came is because I'm 85 and you're 89 and you're 78. And all of us are nudging on towards 100 and there's nothing on earth for us. And it doesn't appear there's anything on Mars either. We all expected not to breathe much more air or crochet many more jolly's. We never have come here. So what I have to propose is a simple thing to take a chance. She reached out and touched the rest to the Hulk of the rocket. This is our rocket. We paid for our trip and we're going to take our trip. Everyone wrestled instead on tiptoes and opened an astonished mouth. Mr. Thurkle began to cry. He did it quite easily and very effectively. We're going to get in the ship, said Mrs. Bellows ignoring him. He were going to take off to where we were going. Mr. Thurkle stopped crying long enough to say, but it was all fake. I don't know anything about space. He's not out there anyway. I lied. I don't know where he is. And I couldn't find him if I wanted to. And you were fooled to ever take my word on it. Yes, said Mrs. Bellows. We were fools. I'll go along on that. But you can't blame us for where old and it was a lovely, good and fine idea. One of the lovelyest ideas in the world. Oh, we didn't really fool ourselves that we could get nearer to him physically. It was the gentle, mad dream of old people. The kind of thing you hold on to for a few minutes a day. Even though you know it's not true. So all of you who want to go, you follow me in the ship. But you can't go, say Mr. Thurkle. You haven't got a navigator. And that ships are ruined. You, say Mrs. Bellows, will be the navigator. She stepped into the ship and after a moment, the other old lady's press forward. Mr. Thurkle, when milling his arms frantically, was nevertheless pressed through the port and in a minute, the door slammed shut. Mr. Thurkle was strapped into the navigator seat with everyone talking at once and holding him down. The special helmets were issued to be fitted over every gray or white head to supply extra oxygen in case of a leakage in the ship's hull. And at long last, the hour had come, and Mrs. Bellows stood behind Mr. Thurkle and said, we're ready, sir. He said nothing. He pleaded with them silently using his great dark wet eyes, but Mrs. Bellows shook her head and pointed to the control. Take off a great Mr. Thurkle Morosley and pull to switch. Everybody fell. The rocket went up from the planet Mars in a great firey glide with the noise of an entire kitchen thrown down an elevator shaft, with a sound of pots and pans and kettles and fires boiling and stewed bubbling. With a smell of burned incense and rubber and sulfur, with a color of yellow fire and a ribbon of red streaking below them, and all the old women singing and holding to each other. And Mrs. Bellows crawling upright in the sying, straining, trembling ship. Head for space, Mr. Thurkle. It can't last, I'd Mr. Thurkle sadly. The ship can't last, it will. It did. The rocket exploded. Mrs. Bellows felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily like a doll. She heard the great screaming and saw the flashes of bodies sailing by her infragments of metal and powdery light. Help, help, cry Mr. Thurkle, fire away on a small radio beam, the ship disintegrated into a million parts, and the old ladies, all 100 of them, were flung straight on ahead with the same velocity as the ship. As for Mr. Thurkle, for some reason of trajectory, perhaps, he had been blown out the other side of the ship. Mrs. Bellow saw him falling separate in a way from them, screaming, screaming. There goes Mr. Thurkle, thought Mrs. Bellows. And she knew where he was going. He was going to be burned and roasted and broiled good, but very good. Mr. Thurkle was falling down into the sun. And here we are, thought Mrs. Bellows. Here we are, going on out and out and out. There was hardly a sense of motion at all, but she knew that she was traveling at 50,000 miles an hour and would continue to travel at that speed for an eternity until. She saw the other women swinging all about her in their own trajectories. A few minutes of oxygen left to each of them in their helmets. In each was looking up to where they were going. Of course, that Mrs. Bellows out into space, out and out in the darkness like a great church in the stars like candles, in spite of everything. Mr. Thurkle, the rocket and the dishonesty. We are going toward the Lord. And there, yes there, as she fell on and on, coming toward her, she could almost discern the outline now. Coming toward her was his mighty golden hand, reaching down to hold her and comfort her like a frightened sparrow. I'm Miss Amelia Bellows. She said quietly in her best company voice. I'm from the planet Earth.

The term Trinity is not a biblical term, and we are not using biblical language when we define what is expressed by it as the doctrine that there is one only and true God, but in the unity of the God here there are three co-eternal and co-equal persons, the same in substance but distinct in subsistence. A doctrine so defined can be spoken of as a biblical doctrine only on the principle that the sense of scripture is scripture. And the definition of a biblical doctrine in such unbiblical language can be justified only on the principle that it is better to preserve the truth of scripture than the words of scripture. The doctrine of the Trinity lies in scripture in solution when it is crystallized from its solvent it does not cease to be scriptural but only comes into clearer view. Or to speak without figure the doctrine of the Trinity is given to us in scripture not informulated definition but in fragmentary illusions when we assemble the disjector, member into their organic unity. We are not passing from scripture but entering more thoroughly into the meaning of scripture. We may state the doctrine in technical terms supplied by philosophical reflection but the doctrine stated is a genuinely scriptural doctrine. Two purely a revealed doctrine. In point of fact the doctrine of the Trinity is purely a revealed doctrine that is to say it embodies a truth which has never been discovered and is indescribable by natural reason. With all his searching men has not been able to find out for himself the deepest things of God. Accordingly, ethnic thought has never attained a trinitarian conception of God nor does any ethnic religion present in its representations of the divine being in the analogy to the doctrine of the Trinity. Triads of divinity is no doubt occur in nearly all polytheistic religions formed under very various influences sometimes as in the Egypt triad of a Cyrus Isos and Horace. It is the analogy of the human family with its father mother and son which lies at their basis. Sometimes they are the effect of mere syncretism. Three day at ease worshiped in different localities being brought together in the common worship of all. Sometimes as in the Hindu triad of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva they represent the cyclic movement of a pantheistic evolution and symbolise the three stages of being becoming and disillusion. Sometimes they are the result apparently of nothing more than an odd human tendency to speak in threes which has given the number three widespread standing as a sacred number. So, H. Yusena. It is no more than was to be anticipated that one or another of these triads should now and again be pointed to as the replica or even the original of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. Glanced and found the Trinity in the Homeric mythology the trident of Poseidon being its symbol. H. Yuga very naturally found it in the Hindu Timuruti which indeed is very like his pantheizing notion of what the Trinity is. Others have perceived it in the Buddhist tree Ratna, Zudablum or despite their crass dualism in some speculations of parciism or more frequently in the notional triad of Platonism while Jules Martin is quite sure that it is present in Phylo's neostorical doctrine of the powers, especially when applied to the explanation of Abraham's three visitors. Of late years, eyes have been turned rather to Babylonia and H. Cemand finds a possible full runner of the Trinity in a father, son and intercessor which he discovers in its mythology. It should be needless to say that none of these triads has the slightest resemblance to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity embodies much more than the notion of Threnus and beyond their Threnus, these triads have nothing in common with it. Three, no rational proof of it. As the doctrine of the Trinity is indescribable by reason, so it is incapable of proof from reason. There are no analogies to it in nature, not even in the spiritual nature of man who is made in the image of God. In his Trinitarian mode of being, God is unique and as there is nothing in the universe like him in this respect, so there is nothing which can help us to comprehend him. Many attempts have nevertheless been made to construct a rational proof of the Trinity of the Godhead. Among these, there are two which are particularly attractive and have therefore been put forward again and again by speculative thinkers through all the Christian ages. These are derived from the implications in the one case of self-consciousness in the other of love. Both self-consciousness and love it is said demand for their very existence and object over against which the self stands as subject. If we conceive of God as self-conscious and loving, therefore we cannot help conceiving of him as embracing in his unity some form of plurality. From this general position, both arguments have been elaborated, however by various thinkers in very very forms. The former of them, for example, is developed by a great 17th century theologian by a follow-mue kekaman 1614 as follows. God is self-conscious thought and God's thought must have a perfect object, existing eternally before it. This object to be perfect must be itself God and as God is one, this object which is God must be the God that is one. It is essentially the same argument which is popularised in a famous paragraph, section 73 of Lessings, the education of the human race. Must not God have an absolutely perfect representation of himself that is a representation in which everything that is in him is found. And would everything that is in God be found in this representation if his necessary reality were not found in it. If everything, everything without exception that is in God is to be found in this representation, it cannot therefore remain a mere empty image but must be an actual duplication of God. It is obvious that arguments like this prove too much. If God's representation of himself to be perfect must possess the same kind of reality that he himself possesses, it does not seem easy to deny that his representations of everything else must possess objective reality. And this would be as much as to say that the eternal objective coexistence of all that God can conceive is given in the very idea of God. And that is open pantheism. The logical flaw lies in including in the perfection of a representation qualities which are not proper to representations however perfect. A perfect representation must of course have all the reality proper to a representation but objective reality is so little proper to a representation that a representation acquiring it would cease to be a representation. This fatal flaw is not transcended but only covered up when the argument is compressed as it is in most of its modern presentations in effect to the mere assertion that the condition of self-consciousness is a real distinction between the thinking subject and the thought object which in God's case would be between the subject ego and the object ego. Why however we should deny to God the power of self-contemplation enjoyed by every finite spirit, save and the cost of the distinct hypothesizing of the contentment and the contemplated self it is hard to understand. Nor is it always clear that what we get is a distinct hypothesization rather than a distinct substantializing of the contentment and contemplated ego not two persons in the guardheads are much as two guards. The discovery of the third hypostasis the Holy Spirit remains meanwhile to all these attempts rationally to construct a Trinity in the divine being a standing puzzle which finds only a very artificial solution. The case is much the same with the argument derived from the nature of love. Our sympathies go out to that old valentinian writer, possibly it was Valentinus himself who reasoned perhaps he was the first so-to-reason that God is all love but love is not love unless there be an object of love. And they go out more richly still to Augustine when seeking a basis not for a theory of emanations but for the doctrine of the Trinity he analyzes this love which God is into the triple implication of the love of the love and love itself and sees in this Trinity of love and analog of the Triune God. It requires however only that the argument thus broadly suggested should be developed into its details for its artificiality to become apparent. Richard of St. Victor works it out as follows. It belongs to the nature of a more that it should turn to another as Karitas. This other in God's case cannot be the world since such love of the world would be inordinate. It can only be a person and a person who is God's equal in eternity power and wisdom. Since however there cannot be two divine substances these two divine persons must form one and the same substance. The best love cannot however confine itself to these two persons it must become con delicdeor by the desire that a third should be equally loved as they loved one another. Thus love when perfectly conceived leads necessarily to the Trinity and since God is all he can be this Trinity must be real. Modern writers Satoreas Shuba-Line J. Mula-Libna most lately are H. Goods-Macher do not seem to have essentially improved upon such a statement as this and after all is said it could not appear clear that God's own all perfect being could not supply a satisfying object of his all-perfect love to say that in its very nature love is self communicative and therefore implies an object other than self seems an abuse of figurative language. Perhaps the ontological proof of the Trinity is nowhere more attractively put than by Jonathan Edwards the peculiarity of this presentation of it lies in an attempt to add plausibility to it by a doctrine of the nature of spiritual ideas or ideas of spiritual things such as thought, love, fear, in general. Ideas of such things he urges are just repetitions of them so that he who has an idea of any act of love, fear, anger or any other act or motion of the mind simply so far repeats the motion in question and if the idea be perfect and complete the original motion of the mind is absolutely re-duplicated. Edwards presses this so far that he is ready to contend that if a man could have an absolutely perfect idea of all that was in his mind at any past moment he would really to all intents and purposes be over again what he was at that moment and if he could perfectly contemplate all that is in his mind at any given moment as it is and at the same time that it is there in its first and direct existence he would really be to at that time he would be twice at once. The idea he has of himself would be himself again. This now is the case with the divine being, guards idea of himself is absolutely perfect and therefore is an express and perfect image of him exactly like him in every respect. But that which is the express perfect image of guard and in every respect like him is guard, tool intents and purposes because there is nothing wanting. There is nothing in the deity that renders it the deity but what has something exactly answering to it in this image which will therefore also render that the deity. The second person of the Trinity being thus attained the argument advances. The guardhead being thus begotten of guards loving, having an idea of himself and showing forth in a distinct subsistence or person in that idea they proceed their most pure act and an infinitely holy and sacred energy arises between the father and the sun in mutually loving and delighting in each other. The deity becomes all act, the divine essence itself flows out and is as it were breathed forth in love and joy so that the guardhead therein stands forth in yet another manner of subsistence and there proceeds the third person of the Trinity the holy spirit vis the deity in act where there is no other act but the act of the will. The inconclusiveness of the reasoning lies on the surface. The mind does not consist in its states and the repetition of its states would not therefore duplicate or triplicate it. If it did we should have a plurality of beings not of persons in one being. Neither guards perfect idea of himself nor his perfect love of himself reproduces himself. He differs from his idea and his love of himself precisely by that which distinguishes his being from his acts. When it is said then that there is nothing in the deity which renders it the deity but what has something answering to it in its image of itself it is enough to respond except the deity itself. What is wanting to the image to make it a second deity is just objective reality. For, supported by reason, inconclusive as all such reasoning is however considered as rational demonstration of the reality of the Trinity it is very far from possessing no value. It carries home to us in a very suggestive way the superiority of the Trinitarian conception of God to the conception of him as an abstract monad and thus brings important rational support to the doctrine of the Trinity when one's that doctrine has been given us by revelation. If it is not quite possible to say that we cannot conceive of God as eternal self-consciousness and eternal love without conceiving him as a Trinity it does seem quite necessary to say that when we conceive him as a Trinity new fullness richness force are given to our conception of him as a self-conscious loving being and therefore we conceive him more adequately than as a monad and no one who has ever once conceived him as a Trinity can ever again satisfy himself with a monadistic conception of God. Reason, thus not only performs the important negative service to faith in the Trinity of showing the self-consistency of the doctrine and its consistency with other known truth but brings this positive rational support to it of discovering in it the only adequate conception of God as self-conscious spirit and living love. Difficult therefore as the idea of the Trinity in itself is it does not come to us as an added burden upon our intelligence it brings a rather the solution of the deepest and most persistent difficulties in our conception of God as infinite moral being and illuminates in riches and elevates all our thought of God. It has accordingly become a common place to say that Christian theeism is the only stable theeism that is as much as to say that theeism requires the enriching conception of the Trinity to give it a permanent hold upon the human mind the mind finds it difficult to rest in the idea of an abstract unity for its God and that the human heart cries out for the living God in whose being there is that fullness of life for which the conception of the Trinity alone provides. 5. Not clearly revealed in the Old Testament So strongly is it felt in wide circles that a Trinitarian conception is essential to a worthy idea of God that there is a broad, a deep-seated unwillingness to allow that God could ever have made himself known otherwise than as a Trinity. From this point of view it is inconceivable that the Old Testament revelation should know nothing of the Trinity. Accordingly I. A. Donner, for example, reasons thus. If, however, and this is the faith of universal Christendom, a living idea of God must be sought in some way after a Trinitarian fashion, it must be enticidentally probable that traces of the Trinity cannot be lacking in the Old Testament since its idea of God is a living or historical one, whether there really exist traces of the idea of the Trinity in the Old Testament, however, is a nice question. Certainly we cannot speak broadly of the revelation of the doctrine of the Trinity in the Old Testament. It is a plain matter of fact that none who have depended on the revelation embodied in the Old Testament alone have ever attained to the doctrine of the Trinity. It is another question, however, whether they may not exist in the pages of the Old Testament, turns of expression or records of occurrences in which one already acquainted with the doctrine of the Trinity may fairly see indications of an underlying implication of it. The older writers discovered intimations of the Trinity and such phenomena as the plural form of the divine name Elohim, the occasional employment with reference to God of plural pronouns, let us make man in our image, Genesis 1, 26, 3, 22, 11, 7, Isaiah 6, 8, or of plural verbs, Genesis 20, 13, 35, 7, certain repetitions of the name of God, which seemed to distinguish between God and God, Genesis 1927, Psalm 45, 6 and 7, 111, Isaiah 17, 3fold, liturgical formulas, Deuteronomy 16, 4, numbers 6, 24, 26, Isaiah 6, 3, a certain tendency to hypothesize the conception of wisdom, Proverbs 8, and especially the remarkable phenomena connected with the appearances of the angel of Jehovah, Genesis 16, 2 to 13, 22, 11 and 16, 31, 11 and 13, 48, 15 and 16, Exodus 3, 2, 4 and 5, Judges 13, 20 to 22. The tendency of more recent authors is to appeal not so much to specific texts of the Old Testament as to the very organism of revelation in the Old Testament in which there is perceived an underlying suggestion that all things owe their existence and persistence to a threefold cause, both with reference to the first creation and more plainly with reference to the second creation. Passengers like Psalm 33, 6, Isaiah 61, 1, 63, 9 to 12, Hagai 2, 5 and 6, in which God and his word and his spirit are brought together, co-courses of effects are reduced. A tendency is pointed out to hypothesize the word of God on the one hand, for example, Genesis 13, Psalm 33, 6, 117, 20, 119, 87, 147, 15 to 18, Isaiah 55, 11 and especially in Ezekiel and the later prophets the spirit of God on the other, for example, Genesis 12, Isaiah 48, 16, 63, 10, Ezekiel 22, 8, 3, Zechariah 712. Suggestions, in Isaiah for instance, 714, 96 of the deity of the Messiah are appeal to, and if the occasional occurrence of plural verbs and pronouns referring to God and the plural form of the name Elohim are not insisted upon as in themselves evidence for a multiplicity in the Godhead, yet a certain weight is lent them as witnesses that the God of Revelation is no abstract unity, but the living true God who in the fullness of his life embraces the highest variety. Baving. The upshot of it all is that it is very generally felt that somehow in the Old Testament development of the idea of God, there is a suggestion that the deity is not a simple monad and that there is a preparation is made for the revelation of the Trinity yet to come. It would seem clear that we must recognize in the Old Testament doctrine of the Revelation of God to his revelation by the creative word and the spirit, at least the germ of the distinctions in the Godhead afterward made fully known in the Christian Revelation, and we can scarcely stop there. After all this said in the light of the later revelation, the Trinitarian interpretation remains the most natural one of the phenomena which the older writers frankly interpret it as intimations of the Trinity, especially of those connected with the descriptions of the angel of Jehovah, no doubt, but also even of such a form of expression as meets us in the Letters Make Man in our image of Genesis 126, for sure the verse 27, and God created man in his own image does not encourage us to take the preceding verse as announcing that man was to be created in the image of the angels. This is not an illegitimate reading of New Testament ideas into the text of the Old Testament, it is only reading the text of the Old Testament under the illumination of the New Testament revelation. The Old Testament may be likened to a chamber richly furnished but dimly lighted, the introduction of light brings into it nothing which was not in it before, but it brings out into clear review much of what is in it, but what was only dimly or even not at all perceived before. The mystery of the Trinity is not revealed in the Old Testament, but the mystery of the Trinity underlies the Old Testament revelation, and here and there almost comes into view. Thus the Old Testament revelation of God is not corrected by the full revelation which follows it, but only perfected, extended, and enlarged. Six, prepared for in the Old Testament. It is an old saying that what becomes patent in the New Testament was latent in the Old Testament, and it is important that the continuity of the revelation of God contained in the two Testaments should not be overlooked or obscured. If we find some difficulty in perceiving for ourselves in the Old Testament, definite points of attachment for the revelation of the Trinity, we cannot help perceiving with great cleanness in the New Testament abundant evidence that its writers felt no in-congruity whatever between their doctrine of the Trinity and the Old Testament conception of God. The New Testament writers certainly were not conscious of being set as forth of strange gods. To their own apprehension they worshiped and proclaimed just the God of Israel, and they laid no less stress than the Old Testament itself upon his unity. John 173, 1 Corinthians 8 4, 1 Timothy 2 5, they do not then, placed two new gods by the side of Jehovah as alike with him to be served and worshiped. They conceive Jehovah as himself at once, father, son, and spirit. In presenting this one Jehovah as father, son, and spirit, they do not even betray any looking feeling that they are making innovations. Without apparent misgiving, they take over Old Testament passages and apply them to father, son, and spirit indifferently. Obviously, they understand themselves and wish to be understood as setting forth in the father, son, and spirit, just the one God that the God of the Old Testament revelation is, and they are as far as possible from recognising any breach between themselves and the fathers in presenting their enlarged conception of the divine being. This may not amount to saying that they saw the doctrine of the Trinity everywhere taught in the Old Testament. It certainly amounts to saying that they saw the Triune God, who may worship in the God of the Old Testament revelation, and felt no incongruity in speaking of their Triune God, in the terms of the Old Testament revelation. The God of the Old Testament was their God, and their God was a Trinity, and their sense of the identity of the two was so complete that no question as to it was raised in their minds. 7. Pre-supposed in the New Testament. The simplicity and assurance, with which the New Testament writers speak of God as a Trinity, have, however, a further implication, if they betray no sense of novelty and so speaking of Him, this is undoubtedly in part because it was no longer a novelty, so to speak of Him. It is clear, in other words, that, as we read the New Testament, we are not witnessing the birth of a new conception of God, what we meet with in its pages is a firmly established conception of God underlying and giving its tone to the whole fabric. It is not in a text here and there that the New Testament bears its testimony to the doctrine of the Trinity. The whole book is Trinitarian to the core, all its teaching is built on the assumption of the Trinity, and its illusions to the Trinity are frequent, cursory, easy, and confident. It is, with a view to the curseriness of the illusions to it in the New Testament, that it has been remarked that the doctrine of the Trinity is not so much heard as overheard in the statements of Scripture. It would be more exact to say that it is not so much inculcated as presupposed, that doctrine of the Trinity does not appear in the New Testament in the making, but as already made. It takes its place in its pages, as Gunker phrases it, with an air almost of complaint already in full completeness, fully fathomed, leaving no trace of its growth. There is nothing more wonderful in the history of human thought, says Sande, with his eye on the appearance of the doctrine of the Trinity in the New Testament, than the silent and imperceptible way in which this doctrine, to us so difficult to get place without struggle and without controversy among accepted Christian truths. The explanation of this remarkable phenomenon is, however, simple. Our New Testament is not a record of the development of the doctrine, or of its assimilation. It everywhere presupposes the doctrine as the fixed possession of the Christian community and the process by which it became the possession of the Christian community lies behind the New Testament. 8. Manifested in the Sun and Spirit We cannot speak of the doctrine of the Trinity therefore if we study exactness of speech as revealed in the New Testament any more than we can speak of it as revealed in the Old Testament. The Old Testament was written before its revelation the New Testament after it. The revelation itself was not made in a word, but indeed, it was made in the incarnation of God the Sun and the outpouring of God the Holy Spirit. The relation of the two Testaments to this revelation is in the one case that of preparation for it and in the other that of product of it. The revelation itself is embodied just in Christ and the Holy Spirit. This is as much as to say that the revelation of the Trinity was incidental too and the inevitable effect of the accomplishment of redemption. It was in the coming of the Son of God in the likeness of sinful flesh to offer himself a sacrifice for sin and in the coming of the Holy Spirit to convict the world of sin of righteousness and of judgment that the Trinity of persons in the unity of the Godhead was once for all revealed to men. Those who knew God the Father who loved them and gave his own son to die for them and the Lord Jesus Christ who loved them and delivered himself up and offering and sacrificed for them and the spirit of grace who loved them and 12th within them, a power not themselves making for righteousness knew the triune God and could not think or speak of God otherwise then as triune. The doctrine of the Trinity in other words is simply the modification ruled in the conception of the one on the God by his complete revelation of himself in the redemptive process. It necessarily waited therefore upon the completion of the redemptive process for its revelation and its revelation as necessarily lay complete in the redemptive process. From this central fact we may understand more fully several circumstances connected with the revelation of the Trinity to which a Luzian has been made. We may from it understand for example why the Trinity was not revealed in the Old Testament. It may carry us a little way to remark as it has been customary to remark since the time of Gregory of Neziansus that it was the task of the Old Testament revelation to six firmly in the minds and hearts of the people of God the great fundamental truth of the unity of the Godhead and it would have been dangerous to speak to them of the plurality within this unity until this task had been fully accomplished. The real reason for the delay in the revelation of the Trinity however is grounded in the secular development of the redemptive purpose of God. The times were not ripe for the revelation of the Trinity in the unity of the Godhead until the fullness of time had come for God to send forth his son unto redemption and his spirit unto sanctification. The revelation in word must need wait upon the revelation in fact to which it brings its necessary explanation no doubt, but from which also it derives its own entire significance and value. The revelation of a Trinity in the divine unity as a mere abstract truth without relation to manifested fact and without significance to the development of the kingdom of God would have been far into the whole method of the divine procedure as it lies exposed to us in the pages of scripture. Here the outworking of the divine purpose supplies the fundamental principle to which all else, even the progressive stages of revelation itself is subsidiary and advances in revelation are ever closely connected with the advancing accomplishment of the redemptive purpose. We may understand also however from the same central fact why it is that the doctrine of the Trinity lies in the New Testament rather in the form of illusions than in express teaching why it is rather everywhere pre-supposed coming on the here and there into incidental expression than formally inculcated. It is because the revelation having been made in the actual occurrences of redemption was already the common property of all Christian hearts. In speaking and writing to one another Christians therefore, rather spoke out of their common trinitarian consciousness and reminded one another of their common fund of belief than instructed one another in what was already the common property of all. We are to look for and we shall find in the New Testament illusions to the Trinity rather evidence of how the Trinity believed in by all was conceived by the authoritative teachers of the church than formal attempts on their part by authoritative declarations to bring the church into the understanding that God is a Trinity. 9. Implied in the whole New Testament. The fundamental proof that God is a Trinity is supplied thus by the fundamental revelation of the Trinity in fact that is to say in the incarnation of God the Son and the outpouring of God the Holy Spirit. In a word Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are the fundamental proof of the doctrine of the Trinity. This is as much as to say that all the evidence of whatever kind and from whatever source derived that Jesus Christ is God manifested in the flesh and that the Holy Spirit is a divine person is just so much evidence for the doctrine of the Trinity and that when we go to the New Testament for evidence of the Trinity we are to seek it not merely in the scattered illusions to the Trinity as such. New Meris and Instructive as they are but primarily in the whole Mass of Evidence which the New Testament provides of the deity of Christ and the divine personality of the Holy Spirit. When we have said this we have said in effect that the whole Mass of the New Testament is evidence for the Trinity. For the New Testament is saturated with evidence of the deity of Christ and the divine personality of the Holy Spirit. Precisely what the New Testament is is the documentation of the religion of the incarnate Son and of the outboard spirit that is to say of the religion of the Trinity and what we mean by the doctrine of the Trinity is nothing but the formulation in exact language of the conception of God presupposed in the religion of the incarnate Son and outboard spirit. We may analyze this conception and reduce proof for every constituent element of it from the New Testament declarations. We may show that the New Testament everywhere insists on the unity of the Godhead that it constantly recognizes the Father as God, the Son as God and the Spirit as God and that it cursorly presents these three to us as distinct persons. It is not necessary however to enlarge here on facts so obvious. We may contend ourselves with simply observing that to the New Testament there is but one only living and true God, but that to it Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are each God in the fullest sense of the term and yet Father Son and Spirit stand over against each other as I and thou and he. In this composite fact the New Testament gives us the doctrine of the Trinity. For the doctrine of the Trinity is but the statement in well-guarded language of this composite fact. Throughout the whole course of the many efforts to formulate the doctrine exactly which have followed one and other during the entire history of the church indeed the principle which has ever determined the result has always been determination to do just to see and conceiving the relations of God, the Father, God, the Son and God the Spirit on the one hand to the unity of God and on the other to the true deity of the Son and Spirit and their distinct personalities. When we have said these three things then that there is but one God that the Father and the Son and the Spirit is each God that the Father and the Son and the Spirit is each a distinct person we have inunciated the doctrine of the Trinity in its completeness. That this doctrine underlies the whole New Testament as its constant pre-supposition and determines everywhere its forms of expression is the primary fact to be noted. We must not omit explicitly to note however that it now and again also as a occasion arises for its incidental enunciation comes itself to expression in more or less completeness of statement. The passages in which the three persons of the Trinity are brought together are much more numerous than perhaps is generally supposed but it should be recognised that the formal collocation of the elements of the doctrine naturally is relatively rare in writings which are occasional in their origin and practical rather than doctrinal in their immediate purpose. The three persons already come into view as divine persons in the enunciation of the birth of our Lord. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee so the angel to Mary and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee. We're for also the Holy Thing which is to be born shall be called the Son of God. Luke 135 margin compare Matthew 118 and following. Here the Holy Ghost is the active agent in the production of an effect which is also ascribed to the power of the most high and the child thus brought into the world is given the great designation of Son of God. The three persons are just as clearly brought before us in the account of Matthew 118 and following. Though the illusions to them are dispersed through a longer stretch of narrative in the course of which the deity of the child is twice intimated. Verse 21 it is he that shall save his people from their sins. Verse 23 they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted God with us. In the baptismal scene which finds record by all the evangelists at the opening of Jesus' ministry, Matthew 3, 16 and 17, Mark 1, 10 and 11, Luke 3, 21 and 22, John 1, 32 to 34, the three persons are thrown up to sight in a dramatic picture in which the deity of each is strongly emphasized. From the open heavens the spirit descends invisible form and a voice came out of the heavens, thou art my son, the beloved. In whom I am well pleased. Thus care seems to have been taken to make the advent of the Son of God into the world the revelation also of the Triune God that the minds of men might as smoothly as possible adjust themselves to the preconditions of the divine redemption which was in process of being wrought out. 10. Conditions the whole teaching of Jesus. With this is a starting point the teaching of Jesus is trinitarianly conditioned throughout. He has much to say of God his father from whom as his son he is in some true sense distinct and with whom he is in some equally true sense one. And he has much to say of the spirit who represents him as he represents the father and by whom he works as the father works by him. It is not merely in the gospel of John that such representations occur in the teaching of Jesus in the synoptics two. Jesus claims a sunship to God which is unique Matthew 1127, 2436, Mark 1332, Luke 1022. In the following passages the title of Son of God is attributed to him and accepted by him. Matthew 46, 829, 1433, 2740, 43 and 54, Mark 1312, 268, 1539, Luke 441, 2270, compare John 1, 34 and 49, 935, 1127 and which involves an absolute community between the two in knowledge, say and power. Both Matthew 1127 and Luke 1022, record his great declaration that he knows the father and the father knows him with perfect mutual knowledge. No one knoweth the sun, say the father, neither doeth any know the father, say the sun. In the synoptics two Jesus speaks of employing the spirit of God himself for the performance of his works as if the activities of God were at his disposal. I, by the spirit of God, or as Luke has it by the finger of God, cast out demons. Matthew 1228, Luke 1120, compare the promises of the spirit in Mark 1311, Luke 1212, end of Trinity Part 1 by Baby Wolfield.",Christianity - Other,English,09:24:57,InTheDesert,"['trinitarian', 'Hindu', 'H.

Buffalo Bill Peacemaker Chapter 1 The Prisoner in the Dugout Fate was in a very capricious mood when Buffalo Bill and his parts carried their Activities into the Lone Star State. They galloped over the plains and plunged full Tilt into one of the most surprising misplays ever made by the air into Gamester, Chance. There was a triangle of blunders, and it so happened that there was a part in each corner Ready to take advantage of what came his way and turn misfortune into fortune For Cataman Perry, his daughter Hattie, and a worthy cowboy of the name of Dunbar. The powerful click of Catalbearans were beaten at their own game of freezout And for this, they had the scout and his parts to thank. Buffalo Bill dropped into his corner of the complication on the wide grazing grounds On route to the town of Hakamur, where he was to join Wild Bill, Old Nomad the Trapper, who shared many dangers with the scout, Baron von Schutzenhouser, his Dutch part, and Little Kyus, his Indian trailer. And when it is said that he dropped into the complication, the statement is to be taken Literally. It was a night, a night made brilliant by moon and stars. The scout was two days from Portales, New Mexico, having diverged from the trail taken By his parts in order to halt for half a day in the town of Texico. Buffalo Bill was off the trail, a Plansman having shown him a shortcut that was to save many miles of Saddlework. As Bear paw forged ahead at a slow steady gallop, the scout rocked gently in his saddle, half-dozing. He did not see the stovepipe that rose out of the ground in front of him. Nor did he see the little ridge-like lifting of the earth adjacent to the stovepipe. Bear paw saw the pipe, however, and to evade it, attempted to cross the small elevation. Intelligent horse though he was, how was he to know that elevation was not solid earth. The black charger was in for a surprise. It was sprung with demoralizing sadness. Two strides carried Bear paw over the high point of the ridge. A third stride brought a crash under his rear hoofs, and the after-part of his body slumped Downward. A startled yell, seemingly coming out of the very earth, smooth on the scouts ears. Cotted a disadvantage by the accident, buffalo bill was thrown backward out of his saddle and clear of the struggling horse. Bear paw's front hooves were on solid ground, and with a prodigious effort he saved himself from sinking in clambered to safety beyond the deceptive ridge, but the scout dropped through the breach, grabbed at a log rafter, missed it, and fell in a huddle for a distance of ten feet. He brought up on all fours, jarred through and through, and blinking in a cloud of dust and a flood of lamplight, a clutter of dirt and broken poles lay around him. The transformation from an easy gallop over the cool open plain, to this underground hole with its light and dust, had been so abrupt that the scout was taken at a loss, but he was not the only one taken at a loss. In front of him, as the flurry of dust was waft at a side, he saw a strapping figure in hickory shirt, home spun trousers and cow-hide boots. A figure topped with a mop of red hair, under which was a lean, leathery face. The face of the figure was blank, to wash out blue eyes stared at the scout, and the scout on hands and knees stared back. Who in blazes are ya? Demanded the red-headed man, all at once finding his voice, a stranger and a traveler, answered the scout, the ludicrous nature of the situation gradually appealing to him, a man who, w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-what do you mean by knocking a hole in the roof and slam an end on me like this? When the other, coming out of his surprise with a man or distinctly hostile, the scout picked himself up slowly, felt of his bruises, and gave vent to a gruesome laugh. If you think of me, go, that I meant to knock a hole in your roof, said he, you've another guess coming. If I'd planned to pay you a visit, I wouldn't have gone about it like this, would I? Why do I know who y'all are what you do? Fume the other, far and away more savage than the scout thought the miss-happ warranted. I don't want no truck with you anyways. If you didn't allow to pay me a visit, and if you ain't here from choice, then your next move is to get out as quick as you come in. Demanded the stairs. He waved toward a ladder that led upward to a flat door in the roof, and at the same time we says hello, we also says goodbye, start yourself. I'm not inclined to stay here any longer than you want to have me. Answered the scout, but I landed with something of a jolt. If it's all the same to you, I'll just catch my breath before I try the stairs. It ain't all the same to me, bark the man. I want you to go, and I want you to go to once. With this, to back up the invite, I reckon you won't stand none on the order to hack. The red-haired man made his wipe at his belt, and lifted a hairy hand with a six-shooter. Buffalo Bill looked him in the eye, and then cullies sat down on a two-legged stool that happened to be handy. I've heard a good deal about Texas hospitality, said he, but you're given it a hardware twist that I don't like. And when I don't like a thing, he had his significantly. I'm happy to make it pretty plain. You can't run in any ranicaboo on me, snorted the red-haired person, jabbing the air with the point of his gun. You say your draping in was an accident, I'm letting it go at that, and giving you a chance to depart without any fireworks. And I ain't saying nothing about the damage you've done to the dugout, and other, pick up your hat and scatter all count three. When I say one, you'll reach for the hat. When I say two, you'll be on the stairs. And when I say three, you'll either be through that door in the roof or I'll drop you in your tracks. The barbarous methods of this red-haired man were utterly uncold for. He was showing a spirit that needed timing. Buffalo Bill dropped his eyes to the litter on the floor. His hat lay there, and from under the brim of the hat showed two inches of revolver muzzle. One of the scout's six shooters had been jared from his belt and had fallen under the sombrero. One. The word was a yelp, and the blue-d barrel of the Texans gun looked the scout full in the face. All right, said Buffalo Bill cheerily. He reached for his hat with both hands, but only one hand picked up the hat. The other caught the handle of the six-suiter. Then something happened, which the Texan had not been looking for. As the scout arose from the stool, the report of a firearm split the air. A bullet passed through the crown of the sombrero, sent the Texans ear, and clipped a lock of his red hair. For an instant, barely an instant, the Texans revolver shook on certainly. That instant spelled opportunity for the scout. With the speed of thought, he grabbed a hostile gun, jerked it away, and looked over the sights at his owner. What on should count, too? Inquired the scout pleasantly, but the Texan had lost the count. Instead of trying to find it and go on with it, he began to swear. Sit down. Ordered Buffalo Bill. I've caught my breath all right, but I want to read you a lesson in common civility, and show you how to treat a traveler who accidentally drops in on you through the roof of your dugout. Someone laughed. It was not the red-haired man, of course, for he was in anything but a merry mood. The laughter came from behind the scout, and it was the first animation that there was anyone else in the place. The scout could not very well turn from the red-haired man and investigate. Who's doing that? He demanded. You'll get right out here. Flame the red-haired man. This ain't none of your put in, or I wasn't talking to you. Cut in the scout sharply. Who are you behind there? Night Dunbar came the answer. If you're a friend of this red-haired, raw-hide Dunbar, preceded the scout, why don't you step up behind me and help me put him out? For two reasons, answered the voice behind. First off, neighbor, I'm no friend of Ed Steves. Then again, I'm last and laid away on the shelf. If I was able to move, I'd take red-steve down and choke the breath out of him. Dunbar's a hostage that I've captured. Cried red-steve, and I want you to go on about your business and leave us alone. I'm no horked thief, said Dunbar, and red-steve talks crooked. He's working for Banner and Phelps, and the rest of those cattle bearins on the brizos. It's tinhorn to work too, and red-haired has to use the double-tong. I thought there was something more than just common in civility backer his treatment of me. Observe the scout, a glitter rising in the eyes that looked across the revolver sights. Don't you try to talk? He said this turn linked to the man in front of him. Walk around and take the ropes off Dunbar. When I count one, you'll begin to move. When I say two, you'll begin on the ropes. And when I finish with three, if Dunbar isn't clear of his bonds, I'll do something more than sing your ear and take a lock in your red hair. Chance it seems has bumbled, and dropped me into the right place at just about the right time. Now then, one. There was that in the scout-sized manor, which caused red-steve to start promptly toward the other side of the dugout. As he moved, the scout turned on the stool and let the revolver follow him.

The Adventure of the Copper Beaches by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Part 1 The man who loves art for its own sake, remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph. It is frequently in its least important and lolliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe Watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to drop, and I am bound to say occasionally to embellish. You have given prominence not so much to the many causes, celebs, and sensational trials in which I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province. And yet, set eye smiling. I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records. You have heard perhaps he observed, taking up a glowing sender with the tongs, and lighting with it the long cherry wood pipe which was wanted to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood. You have heard perhaps in attempting to put color and life into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing. It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter. I remarked with some coldness. For I was repelled by the ego-tism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character. No, it is not selfishness or conceit, set he answering as was his want, my thoughts rather than my words. If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing. A thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should well. You have degraded which should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales. It was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cherry fire in the old room at Becker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of done colored houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow reeds. Our gas was lit and shown on the white cloth and glimmer of China and metal for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until it last, having apparently given up his search. He had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings. At the same time, he remarked, after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire. You can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion, do not treat a crime in his legal sense at all. The small matter in which I endeavor to help the king of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial. The end may have been so, I answered, but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest. Wish all my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction? But indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are passed. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. First to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note, I had this morning, Mark Smi0.iFancy. Read it. He tossed a crumpled letter across to me. He was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening and ran thus. Dear Mr. Holmes, I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as a governess. I shall call it half past ten tomorrow if I do not inconvenience you, yours faithfully, violet hunter. Do you know the young lady? I asked, not I. It is half past ten now. Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring. It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carvugle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case also. Well, let us hope so, but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless I am much mistaken, is the person a question. As he spoke, the door opened at a young lady entered the room. She was plainly, but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman, who has had her own way to make in the world. You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure, said she as my companion rose to greet her. But I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents, our relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do. Pray, take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you. I could see that Holmes was favorably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself with his lids drooping in his fingertips together to listen to her story. I have been a governess for five years, such as in the family of Colonel Spence Monroe. And two months ago, the Colonel received an appointment at Halifax in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last, the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wits in as to what I should do. There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaways, and there I used to call about once a week, in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment, wait in and anti-room, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them. Well, when I called last week, I was shown into the little office's usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man, with a very swirling face and a great heavy chin, which rolled down and fold upon fold over his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in, he gave quite a jump in his chair entering quickly to Miss Stoper. But will do, said he, I could not ask for anything better. Capital capital. He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him. You are looking for a situation Miss. Yeser. What shall we do you ask? I had four pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Monroe. A whole taut, taut, sweating, ranks wetting. He cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a barleying passion. How could anyone offer so pitiful, some to a lady with such attraction and accomplishments? My accomplishments, Sir, may be less than you imagine, said I. A little French, a little German, music, and drawing. Taut, taut, he cried. That is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and department of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may someday play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have, why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under three figures? Your salary with me, Madam would commence at £100 a year. You may imagine Mr. Holmes that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. He checked them on however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face. Open day pocketbook and took out a note. It is also my custom, said he, smiling in the most present fashion, until his eyes were just too little shining slits amid the white creases of his face. To advance to my young ladies, half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe. It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience. And yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction, which made me wish to know a little more before I committed myself. May I ask where you live, sir? Set eye. Hampshire, charming rural place, the copper beaches, five miles on the far side of Winchester, it is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old country house. And my duty, sir, I should be glad to know if they would be. One child, one dear little romper, just six years old, oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper, smack, smack, smack, smack, three gone before you could wink. He leaned back in his chair and left his eyes into his head again. I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking. My soul duties then, I asked, or to take charge of a single child? No, no, not the soul, not the soul, my dear young lady, he cried. Your duty would be, as I am sure, your good sense which suggest to obey any little commands of my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, eh? I should be happy to make myself useful. Quite so, in dress now, for example, we are fatty people, you know, fatty but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim, eh? No, said I, considerably astonished at his words, or to sit here or sit there, that would not be offensive to you? Oh, no, or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us? I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxurious, and of a rather peculiar tent of chestnut, it has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion. I am afraid that that is quite impossible, said I. He had been watching the eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke. I am afraid that it is quite essential, said he. It is a little fancy of my wife, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam. These fancies must be consulted, and so you won't cut your hair? No, sir, I really could not. I answered firmly. Ah, very well then, that quite settles the matter. It is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Mr. Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies. The manageress had set all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face, but I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal. Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked? If you please, Mr. Stoper? Well, really, it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion, said she sharply. You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Today, to you, Mr. Hunter. She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page. Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary manners, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governments as an England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me. Many people were improved by wearing it short, and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day, I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here, and I will read it to you. The copper beaches near Winchester. Here a mist hunter.

We didn't do anything wrong hardly by Roger Cucundall. After all, they only borrowed a little while, just to fix it. I mean, it isn't like we swiped anything. We maybe borrowed a couple of things like, but gee, we put everything back like we found it pretty near. Even like the compressor we got from Stinky Brinker that his old man was using, and I traded my outboard motor for my old my father, maybe trade back. But it was like skinny set, skinny Thompson. He's the one you guys keep calling the boy genius, but Chuck C's no. Well yeah, it's like skinny set. We didn't need an outboard motor, and we didn't need a compressor. You've got to have a compressor on a spaceship. Everybody knows that. And that old compression chamber that old man, I mean, Mr. Fields let us use didn't have a compressor. Sure, he said we could use it. Anyway, he said we could play with it, and skinny set, we were going to make a spaceship out of it, and he said go ahead. Well, no, he didn't say it exactly like that. I mean, well, like he didn't take it serious sort of. Anyway, I made a swell spaceship. It had four port holes on it, and an airlock, and real bumps in it, and lots of room for all that stuff that skinny put in there, but it didn't have a compressor, and that's why what stuff? Oh, you know, the stuff that skinny put in there, like the radar you made out of a TV set, and the anti-gravity and the atomic power plant he invented to run it all with, he's also smart, skinny is, but he's not like what you think of a genius. You know, he's not all the time using big words, and it doesn't look like a genius. I mean, we call him skinny because he used to be skinny. But he isn't now. I mean, he's maybe small for his age. Anyway, he's more than me. And I'm the same age he is. Of course, I'm big for my age, so that doesn't mean much, does it? Well, I guess stinker, Brinker, started it. He's always riding skinny about one thing or another, but skinny never gets mad, and it's a good thing for stinker, too. I saw skinny clean up on a bunch of ninth graders. Well, a couple of them. Anyway, they were saying, well, I guess I won't tell you what they were saying. Anyway, skinny used judo, I guess, because there wasn't much of a fight. Anyway, stinker said something about how he was going to be a rocket pilot when he grew up. And I told him that skinny had told me that there wouldn't be any rockets, and that anti-gravity would be the thing as soon as it was invented. So stinker said it never would be invented. And I said it would, so any said it would not. Nice said. Well, if you're going to keep interrupting me, how can I? All right. Anyway, skinny broke into the argument and said that he could prove mathematically that anti-gravity was possible. And stinky said sure, he could and skinny said sure he could. And stinky said, sure, he could. Like that. Honestly, is that any way to argue? I mean, it sounds like two people agreeing, only stinky keeps going sure. Like that, you know. And stinky, what does he know about mathematics? He's had to take remedial arithmetic ever since. No, I don't understand how the anti-gravity works. skinny told me, but it was something about mezin flow and stuff like that that I didn't understand. The atomic power plant made more sense. Where do we get what uranium? A G, no, we couldn't afford uranium. So skinny invented a hydrogen fusion plant. Anyone can make hydrogen. You just take zinc and sulfuric acid and doterium. You mean, like heavy hydrogen? No, skinny said it would probably work better, but like I said, we couldn't afford anything fancy. As it was, skinny had to pay five or six dollars for that special square tubing in the anti-gravity. And the plus-exface helmets we had cost us 98 cents each. And it cost a dollar and a half for the special tube that skinny needed to make the TV said into a radar. You see, we didn't steal anything really. It was mostly stuff that was just lying around. Like the TV set was up in my attic and the older fidgerator that skinny used the parts to make the atomic power plant out of from. And then a lot of the stuff we already had. Like the skin diving suits we made into space suits and the vacuum pump that skinny had already and the generator. Sure, we did a lot of skin diving, but that was last summer. That's how we knew about old man-bringers compressor that stinky said was his and I traded my outboard motor for and had to trade back. And that's how we knew about Mr. Field's Assault compression chamber and all like that. The rocket? Well, it works on the same principle as the atomic power plant. Only it doesn't work except in a vacuum hardly. Of course you don't need much of a rocket when you have the anti-gravity. Everyone knows that. Well, anyway, that's how we built the spaceship and believe me, it wasn't easy. I mean with stinky all the time bothering us and laughing at us. And I had to do a lot of lawn mowing to get money for the square tubing for the anti-gravity and for the special tube for the radar and my space helmet. stinky called the space helmet's kid stuff. It was always saying things like, say hello to the folks on Mars for me and bring back a bottle of canal number five and all like that, you know. Of course they did look like it stuff, I guess. We bought them at the five and dime and they were meant for kids. Of course when skinny got through with them, they worked fine. We tested them in the airlock of the compression chamber when we got the compressor in. They tested out pretty good for a half hour, then we tried them on in there. Well, it wasn't a complete vacuum, just 27 inches of mercury, but that was okay for a test. So anyway, we got ready to take off stinky was there to watch, of course. He was saying things like farewell, oh, brief pioneers and stuff like that. I mean, it was enough to make you sick. He was standing there laughing and singing something like up in the air, junior birdmen when we closed the airlock door if we couldn't hear him. Skinny started up the atomic power plant and we could see stinky laughing fit to kill. Takes a couple of minutes for it to warm up, you know. So stinky started throwing rocks to attract our attention and skinny was scared that he'd crack a port hole or something. So he threw this switch and we took off. Boy, you should have seen stinky's face. I mean, you really should have seen it. One minute he was laughing, you know, and the next he looked like a goldfish. I guess he always did look like a goldfish, but I mean, even more like them. And he was getting smaller and smaller because we had taken off. We were gone, pretty mere six hours. It was a good thing my mom made me take a lunch. Sure, I told her where we were going. Well, anyway, I told her we were maybe going to fly around the world in skinny and my spaceship or maybe go down to Carson's pond. And she made me take a lunch and maybe promise I wouldn't go swimming alone. And I sure didn't. But we did go around the world three or four times. I lost count. Anyway, that's when we saw the satellite on radar. So skinny pulled the spaceship over to it and we got out and looked at it. The space suits worked fine too. Gosh, no, we didn't steal it or anything. Like skinny said, it was just a menace to navigation and the batteries were dead. It wasn't working right anyway. So we tied it on to the spaceship and took it home. No, we had to tie it on top. It was too big to take inside with the antenna sticking out. Of course, we found out how to fold them later. Well, anyway, the next day, the Russians started squawking about a capitalist plot and someone had swiped their satellite. GME was all the satellites up there who'd misjust one. So I got worried that they'd find out we took it. Of course, I didn't need to worry because sticky told them all right. Just like a saddle tail. So anyway, after skinny got the batteries recharge, we put it back. And then when we landed, there were hundreds of people standing around and Mr. Anderson from the State Department. I guess you know the rest. Except, maybe Mr. Anderson started laughing when we told him and he said it was the best joke on the Russians he ever heard. I guess it is when he think about it. I mean, the Russians complaining about somebody swiping their satellite and then the State Department answering a couple of kids borrowed it. But they put it back. One thing that bothers me though, we didn't put it back exactly the way we found it. But I guess it doesn't matter. You see, when we put it back, we goofed a little. I mean, we put it back in the same orbit more or less. But we got it going in the wrong direction.

The apples of life, part one. Among the gods in Asgard, dwelt the beautiful adun, the goddess whose care was to guard the apples of life. Edoon, Odin had said, as he gave into her hands the rosy apples. To guard these apples and keep them forever from all harm, it should do a greater service for Asgard than even thought with his mighty thunders, or boulder with his warm light can do. For these are the apples of everlasting youth, without them, what would Asgard be, more than the cities of Midgard or Jottenheim? What would the gods be, more than the mortals of Midgard or the giants of Jottenheim? So guard them well, beautiful adun, for to them you owe your beauty, even as we owe to them, I'll never fading youth. One day, when always quiet and peaceful and happy in the city of Asgard, Loki, feeling within him the stirring of his own evil heart, be took himself to Midgard in search of mischief. The peace in quiet of Asgard he couldn't no longer endure. Then too it was to him a cruel delight to shoot his arrows into the lives of the helpless children of Midgard and make them sad. O Loki was a cruel god. Surely, Odin would sometimes say, as he looked upon him and thought of the richness that yet would be fallen Asgard through Loki's wicked deeds. Surely Loki was the spirit of a fresh giant and the fresh giants are bitter, bitter foes of Asgard. This day, Loki longed for mischief. I will go down to Midgard and find some happy heart to sadden, said he, his eyes shining with their wicked delight. Down the rainbow bridge he hastened, and with a light bound sprang upon a bright tree in the beautiful land of Midgard. Who are you he cried, seeing in the tree beside him a great white bird? But the bird may no reply, he only winked and blinked, and stared at Loki, and crowned, and pruned his feathers. Do you not know what God speaks to you? Stormed Loki growing angry even with a bird? Still, no answer. Was there ever such a stupid bird? Indeed, like the people of Midgard, you seem to have no wisdom, sneered Loki. An determined event his evil mood, he seized the branch and began to beat the bird. Then a strange thing happened. The bird, who all this time had seemed so stupid, too stupid even to fly away, now sees the pond the bow and held it fast. Loki pulled and pulled with all his godlike strength. He could not move it. It was as if held in the grass with a giant. Stupid bird, sneered Loki when he found he could do the bird no harm. I will not stay in the tree with such a stupid creature. A strange sound, almost like a laugh of triumph, squeezed itself out from the beak of the big bird. Go, Loki, go once, go back to Asgard, or perhaps you would like to go with me to Jottenheim, spoke to Bird at last. And as he spoke, he spread his wings and arose high in the air. A last, a last for Loki, as the bird rose, he rose to. Nor could he free himself. He screamed, he fought, he begged, he strove with all his godlike arts to free himself. All in vain, on they flew the bird and Loki across the sky, over and under and between the clouds, across the great white sea, alised across the snow-white peaks, down, down to a castle in Jottenheim, in the land of the mighty fresh giants. The terrible, de-treated enemies of the gods. That me free, let me free, foamed Loki, struggling against the bird, whose magic held him fast. I will never let you free, answer the bird, throwing off his disguise and standing forth a giant foe. I will never let you free, except on one condition. I granted, I granted, whatever it is I granted, cried the coward, caring for nothing but to free himself. The condition is this, continued to giant, Koolie. I will let you free, if you will bring me, without delay, the apples of everlasting youth. The apples that it doom guards and watches over locked so closely in the golden casket in the city of Asgard. Loki stared, he called his breath, to give out the apples of life, the fruit by which the gods were kept forever young and strong and beautiful. That was too great a thing to ask, even of Loki evil as he was. There are no such apples, answered he, trying as cowards always do, to hide himself behind a lie. There are no such apples. Very well, answered the giant, opening a great dungeon door and thrusting Loki in. When you are ready to do what I say, you may come out, never until then. The great dungeon door creaked upon its terrible hinges and Loki was alone. A prisoner at the mercy of the fresh giant. Loki howled and beat against the walls of the dungeon. Are you ready to do what I asked of you, asked the fresh giant, opening the great door the next morning? There are no such apples, cried Loki. All my honor as a god I swear it, the giant may no reply, the heavy door creaked again and Loki was alone. Are you ready to do what I asked of you, asked the fresh giant, opening the great door the second morning? Anything at all asgard, oh giant, I promise you, anything but the apples cried Loki. The giant may no reply, the heavy door creaked again and Loki was alone. Are you willing to do what I asked of you, said the fresh giant, opening the great door the third morning? One of the apples, oh giant, I might still from a dune and escape with before the fruit was missed, Loki began. The giant may no reply, the heavy door creaked again and Loki was alone. Are you ready to do what I asked of you, asked the fresh giant, opening the great door the fourth morning? Yes, two of the three apples will I promise to bring you, with even one left the gods might be content, for even then their lives would be far longer than the life of mortals. The giant may no reply, the heavy door creaked again and Loki was alone. Are you ready to do what I asked of you, asked the fresh giant, opening the great door the fifth morning? Yes, and said Loki, makely, are you willing to bring the apples of life? Yes, and you will bring all three of them? Yes, and you will bring them at once. Yes, go then, I will go with you. I will wait for you to bring the apples to me. Then, putting on the guise of birds, the two set forth, reaching the gateway of the city, just as the sun god was pouring down his flood of red and golden light upon the shining spires. The whole city lay bade in the sun set splendour. It dune. And the Loki going directly to her. It is well you gods are closely these golden apples of life. Without them we should grow old and die, even as wretched mortals grow old and die. Indeed, it would fare ill with us if harm came to these precious apples and sit a dune. See the rich bloom upon them? Have that were lost? Then would our bloom be lost as well? We should grow old and wrinkled? Yes, hands of Loki, and still it seems very strange, but outside the gate of our city, just on the outer walls, how growing apples, looking so like these I cannot tell them one from the other. Bring your apples with you, and let us see if they are alike. Have they should prove to be, I will gather them for you, and we will put them all together in the golden casket. How strange, thought of dune innocently. The first giant in his great bird, guys, wield round and round, impatiently awaiting the coming of a dune in the apples. Hardly had the gates closed upon her. When down he swooped, seized her in his great strong beak, and flew with her across the sea to his home among the mountains. The days rolled on and on. The sun got rose, and drove his chariot across the sky, and sank behind the distant purple hills a thousand times. There was a gloom, a shadow over as God, for the gods were growing old. The life gone out of their eyes, this smooth round faces growing thin and peat. Their step was halting, and the fableness of age was falling upon them. It is Loki who has done this. It is Loki who has done this, Thunder Door One Day. When from old age and weakness he had been defeated in battle with a now, ever-guthful giants. It is Loki who has done this, and we will bear it no longer. Look at Odin, even he grows weak, bent and trembling. He is like the old men in Midgar, he Odin the old father. Thor's indignation waxed stronger and stronger. He set forth in search of Loki. I will not even wait for him to come. He thundered, ceasing his hammer and setting forth. I shall find him, the evil hearted somewhere making mischief among the innocent people of Midgar, said he. Henceforth, O evil, hearted, cruel, Loki, burst forth the angry Thor, henceforth, Thor, guards the walls of Asgard. Midgar, the skies, he shall forsake. No more will he brew storms, never shall the Thunder Roan or the lightning's flesh. For Thor will watch forever upon the battlements of Asgard. The approach of the evil God who has brought such grief upon us. Never shall he end to the gates of the city again. Let him dare approach even to the golden gates and Thor will smite him with his mighty hammer. Loki quail before the fury of the great God Thor. To be an outcast from Asgard, even he could not bear. Spammy, spammy, wine the cowardly Loki. Spammy wants more and I will go again to shot him home. I will bring back a dune and the three apples of life. Thor stood looking at the cowardly Loki, how long to strike him with the hammer, to kill him with his Thunderbolt, to scorch him with his lightning arrows. But evil as he was, Loki was immortal. He was the son of Odin. Go then, you mischief, making evil, hearted son of unhappy Odin. Go, and whether success is yours or not. Remember Thor, guards the walls of Asgard, and watches with his Thunders for your return. Never, never as long as Thor wields the mighty hammer and holds the powers of Thunder and lightning, shall Loki end to the golden city without the golden apples of immortal life. Without another word, Loki put on his guise of a great white bird and sped across the sea and sky again to the land of Jottenheim. Straight down he swooped upon the castle of the giant, who all this time had kept it doing a prison in a strong, world tower of solid rock. The giant was out upon the sea, and it is well for me thought Loki, that he is no power and mid-guide or an Asgard could rest these precious apples from the giant's grasp. One quick look out over the mountains and down upon the sea, and Loki sees the dune in his talents, change her at once into a nut, the apples safe within the shell, and swept away towards Asgard. But alas for Loki, the giant had heard the word or the great white wings, leaping to his feet in his boat, he scanned the sky with his sharp giant eye. It is Loki, it is Loki, Bellowed he, catching side of the great white bird among the clouds. It is Loki, it is Loki, no bird of mid-guide flies so high, nor sweeps the air with such mighty wings. With one great giant pool, he shot his boat upon the shore, with one great giant bound, he struck the mountain top. The apples of life, the apples of life he funded, gone, gone, the apples of life are gone. One second, and putting on the guys of a great, great eagle, he shot up into the sky and swiffed the shoot of Loki. The sun got hit his chariot behind a cloud that the shadows might protect and cover Loki. Thor sent forth his thunder, the sky's blackened, the wind beat back the great, great eagle, the lightning staggered and blinded him, still on and on he flew, gaining in spite of all upon the track of Loki. Every giant and jotted high and stood breathless upon his mountain, the great round faces of the giant groutense, the wrinkled aged faces of the god's group hail, it was a terrible race, it was a race for life and health and everlasting youth. Build fires upon the walls, heap up the brush, stand ready with the tapers cried, Odin, who for so the end. The brush was heaped, each god stands ready, his haggard face growing white her, and thinner with bright and dread and eagerness. Already the rush of Loki's wings are heard, the eagle follows close, nearer and nearer, they come closer and closer as the race. One moment more, one second, the frightened eyes of Loki can be seen, so near he is, Thor sent his blinding fire once more across the eagle's track, hit reels, for an instant it falls back, and at one second, with one last mighty stroke, Loki clears the walls, and falls, exhausted, breathless, almost dead upon the golden payment of the city. The fires, the fires, the fires, the fires cried Odin, and instant, and theorizes from the walls, great sheets of blaze, the brush crackles and snaps, and sends up great tongues of fire. The eagle angry, desperate and blinded by the lightning, sweeps on, shaped towards them. Like a foolish mouth, he bears down upon the city, into the very heart of the blaze, a sudden crackling, a cry of pain, a cloud of black black smoke, and the great grey eagle falls, a helpless mass upon the pavement, beside the breathless Loki. The haggard faces flush with hope and joy, the apples of safe, a dunes has come back, the apples again are theirs, and life and joy, and eternal youth once more are with them. Now the goddess of music burst forth again in song, the god of poetry pours forth his melody, a feast is spread, and the gods and goddesses once more eat of the wonderful apples of life. The colour comes back into the faded cheeks, light again flashes from their eyes, youth and health and strength of theirs again, peace reigns once more in as god.

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice, she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it. And what is the use of a book? What Alice? Without pictures or conversations. So she was considering in her own mind, as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid. Whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisy. When suddenly, a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that. Nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself. Oh dear, oh dear, I shall be late. When she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural. But when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waste coat pocket and looked at it. And then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind, that she had never before seen a rabbit, with either a waste coat pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity. She ran across the field after it. And fortunately, was just in time to see it popped down a large rabbit hole under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it. Never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down. So suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself, before she found herself, falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder, what was going to happen next? First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything. Then, she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cobbards and bookshelves. Here and there, she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment, it was empty. She did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath. So managed to put it into one of the cobbards as she fell past it. Well, thought Alice to herself. After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they all think me at home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house, which was very likely true. Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? I wonder, how many miles I fallen by this time. She said aloud, I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. Let me see. That would be 4,000 miles down. I think. For you see, Alice had learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school room. And though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her. Still, it was good practice to say it over. Yes, that's about it the right distance. But then I wonder, what latitude or longitude I've got to? Alice had no idea what latitude was, or longitude either. But thought they were nice, grand words to say. Presently she began again. I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth. How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward. The antipathies. I think. She was rather glad there was no one listening this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word. But I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is. You know, please, ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia? And she tried to curtsy as she spoke. Fancy curtsying as you're falling through the air. Do you think you could manage it? And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking. No, it'll never do to ask. Perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere. Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do. So, Alice began talking again. Dina will miss me very much too, Knight. I should think? Dina was the cat. I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea time. Dina, my dear. I wish you were down here with me. There are no mice in the air. I'm afraid. But you might catch a bat. And that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats? I wonder? And here, Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way. Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats? And sometimes. Do bats eat cats? Or, you see, as she couldn't answer either question. It didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off. And it just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dina and saying to her very earnestly. Now, Dina, tell me the truth. Did you ever eat a bat? When suddenly, thump, thump, down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves. And the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up onto her feet in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark overhead. Before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice liked the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned to corner. Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting. She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen. She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked. And when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering, how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly, she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it, except a tiny golden key. An Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall. But, Alice, either the locks were too large, or the key was too small. But at any rate, it would not open any of them. However, on the second-ty round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before. And behind it was a little door about 15 inches high. She tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted. Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage. Not much larger than a rat hole. She knelt down and looked along the passage, into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wonder about, among those beds, of bright flowers, and those cool fountains. But she could not even get her head through the doorway. And even if my head would go through, thought poor Alice. It would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope. I think I could, if I only knew how to begin. For you see, so many out of the way things had happened lately. That Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table. Half hoping she might find another key on it. Or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes. This time, she found a little bottle on it. Which certainly was not here before? Said Alice. And round the neck of the bottle was a paper label. With the words, drink me, beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say, drink me. But the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. No, all book first, she said. And see whether it's marked poison or not. But for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and in up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things. All because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them. Such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long. And that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds. And she had never forgotten that. If you drink from a bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you. Sooner or later. However, this bottle was not marked poison, so Alice ventured to taste it. And finding it very nice. It had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast. She very soon finished it off. What a curious feeling. said Alice. I must be shutting up like a telescope. And so it was indeed. She was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further. She felt a little nervous about this. For it might end, you know. said Alice to herself. In my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then. And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like. After, the candle is blown out. And for she could not remember, ever, having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened. She decided on going into the garden at once. But, Alice, for poor Alice, when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key. And when she went back to the table for it. She found she could not possibly reach it. She could see it quite plainly through the glass. And she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table. But it was too slippery. And when she had tired herself out with trying. The poor little thing sat down and cried. Oh, there's no use in crying like that. I advise you to leave off this minute. She generally gave herself very good advice. Though she very seldom followed it. And sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes. And once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself. In the game of Croquet, she was playing against herself. For this curious child, was very fond of pretending to be two people. But it's no use now. Thought poor Alice. To pretend to be two people? Why? There's hardly enough of the left to make one respectable person. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table. She opened it and found in it a very small cake. On which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currents. Well, I'll eat it. Said Alice. And if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key. And if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door. So either way, I'll get into the garden and I don't care which happens. She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself. Which way? Which way? Holding her hand on a tap of her head to feel which way it was growing. And she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake. But Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing, but out of the way things to happen. That it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she sat to work and very soon finished off the cake.

Short Science Fiction Collection 077,Various,95178,14.0,"April 8, 2021",[],0,". One shot by James Blisch. On the day that the Polish freighter, Ludmilla, late in Aig in New York Harbor, Abner, Longmans, One shot, Brown, was in the city, going about his normal business, which was making another million dollars. As we found out later, almost nothing else was normal about that particular weekend for Brown. For one thing, he had brought his family with him, a complete departure from routine, reflecting the unprecedentedly legitimate nature of the deals he was trying to make. From every point of view, it was a bag a weekend for the CIA to mix into his affairs, but nobody had explained that to the master of the Ludmilla. I had better add here that we knew nothing about this until afterward. From the point of view of the storyteller, an organization like civilian intelligence associates gets to all its facts backwards. Entering the tale with the payoff, working back to the hook, and whining up with a sheaf of background facts to feed into the computer for next time. This rough on the various people who've tried to fictionalize what we do, particularly for the lazy examples of the breed, who come to us expecting that their plotting has already been done for them, but it's inherent in the way we operate, and there it is. Certainly nobody at CIA so much as thought of Brown when the news first came through. Harry Anderton, the Harbor Defense Chief, called us at 0830 Friday to take on the job of identifying the Aig. This was when our records show us officially entering the affair, but of course, Anderton had been keeping the wires to Washington steaming for an hour before that, getting authorization to spend some of his money on us. Our clearance status was then, and is now, C. and R. C. and R. R. I was in the central office when the call came through, and had some difficulty in making out precisely what Anderton wanted of us. Slow down, Colonel Anderton, please, I beg them. Two or three seconds won't make them at a difference. How did you find out about this egg in the first place? The automatic compartment bulkheads on the Lou Miller were defective, he said. It seems that this egg was buried among a lot of other crates in the dump cell of the hold. What's a dump cell? It's a sealock for getting rid of dangerous cargo. The bottom of it opens right to Davie Jones. Andred fitting for ships carrying explosives, radioactives, anything that might act up unexpectedly. All right, I said, go ahead. While there was a timer on the dump cell floor, set to drop the egg when the ship came up the river. That worked fine, but the automatic bulkheads that are supposed to keep the rust of the ship from being flooded while the cells open didn't. At least they didn't do a thorough job. The Lou Miller began to list and the captain yelled for help. When the harbor patrol found the dump cell open, they called us in. I see. I thought about it a moment. In other words, you don't know whether the Lou Miller really laid an egg or not. That's what I keep trying to explain to you, Dr. Harris. We don't know what she dropped and we haven't any way of finding out. It could be a bomb. It could be anything. We're sweating everybody on board the ship now, but it's my guess that none of them know anything, the whole procedure was designed to be automatic. All right. We'll take it, I said. You've got divers down. Sure, but we'll worry about the butthrom here on. Get us a direct line from your barge to the big board here so we can direct the work. Better get on over here yourself. Right. He sounded relieved. Official people have a lot of confidence in the CIA too much in my estimation. Some day the job will come along that we can't handle and then Washington will be kicking itself or more likely some scapegoat for having failed to develop a comparable government department. Not that there was much prospect of Washington's doing that. Official thinking had been running in the other direction for years. The president was the Associated Universities Organization which ran Brookhaven. CIA had been started the same way by a loose corporation of universities and industries, all of which had wanted to own an ultimac and no one of which had had the money to buy one for itself. The Eisenhower administration with its emphasis on private enterprise and concomitant reluctance to sink federal funds into products at such size had turned the two examples into a nice fat trend which ultimac herself said wasn't going to be reversed within the practical lifetime of CIA. I buzzed for two staffers and in five minutes got Clark Jainey and Joan Hademard. CIA's business manager and social science division chief respectively. The titles were almost solely for the benefit of the TO that is Clark and Joan do serve in those capacities but said service takes about 2% of their capacities and their time. I shot them a couple of zanases of explanation trusting them to pick up whatever else they needed from the tape and checked the line to the diver's barge. It was already open. Anderton had gone to work quickly and with decision once he was sure we were taking on the major question. The television screen lit but nothing showed on but murky light striped with streamers of darkness slowly rising and fallen. The audio went quank oing oing oing oing underwater noises, shapeless and characterless. Hello out there in the harbor this is CIA Harris calling come in please. Monochir the audio said, boink oing oing. Got anything yet? Not a thing Dr. Harris Monoch said. You can't see three inches in front of your face down here it's too salty. We've bumped into a couple of crates but so far no egg. Keep trying. Cheney looking even more like a bulldog than usual was sending his stopwatch by one of the eight clocks on Ultimax face. Want me to take the divers he said? No clock not yet. I'd rather have Jane do it for the moment. I passed the mic to her. He'd better run her probability series first. Check. Handfeeding tape into the integrator's mouth. What's your angle Peter? The ship. I want to see how heavily sheaded that dump cell is. It isn't shielded at all, andretons voice said behind me. I hadn't heard him come in. But that doesn't prove anything. The egg might have carried sufficient shielding in itself. Or maybe the commies didn't care whether the crew was exposed or not. Or maybe there isn't any egg. All that's possible, I admitted, but I want to see it anyhow. Have you taken blood tests, Joan asked Anderton? Yes. Get the reports through to me then. I want white cell counts, differentials, plate that counts, hematocrit, and said rates on every man. Anderton picked up the phone, and I took a firm hold on the door knob. Hey, Anderton said putting the phone down again. Are you going to duck out just like that? Remember Dr. Harris? We've got to evacuate the city first of all. No matter whether it's a real egg or not, we can't take the chance on it's not being an egg. Don't move a man until you get to go ahead from CIA, as said. For all we know now, evacuating the city may be just what the enemy wants us to do, so they can grab it unarmed. Or they may want to start a panic for some other reason. Any one of 50 possible reasons. You can't take such a gamble, he said, really. Here are eight and a half million lives riding on it. I can't let you do it. You passed your authority to us when you hired us, I pointed out. If you want to evacuate without a Rok, you'll have to fire us first. It'll take another hour to get that cleared from Washington, so you might as well give us the hour. He stared at me for a moment, as it lips thinned, then he picked up the phone again to order Jones Blood Count and I got out the door fast. A reasonable man would have said that I found nothing useful on the Lou Miller, except negative information. But the fact is that anything I found would have been a surprise to me. I went down looking for surprises. I found nothing but a fent trailed Abner Longman's Brown, most of which was 15 years cold. There'd been a time when I'd known Brown, briefly, and to no profit either of us. As an undergraduate majoring in social sciences, I'd taken out a term paper on the old international Longshore Mints Association, a racket-ridden union now formally extinct, although anyone who knew the science could still pick up some traces on the docks. In those days, Brown had been the business manager of an insurance firm. The soul-visible function of which had been to write policies for the ILA, and its individual dock wallabbers. For some reason he had been amused by the Brash Youngster who had barged in on him and demanded the low down, and had shown me considerable lengths of ropes, not normally in view of the public. Nothing uncriminating, but enough to give me a better insight into how the union operated than I had at any right to expect, or even suspect. Hence I was surprised to hear somebody on the dock's remark that Brown was in the city over the weekend. It would never have occurred to me that he would still interested himself in the water for he'd gone respectable with vengeance. He was still a professional gambler, and according to what he had told the Congressional investigating committee last year, took in 30 to $50,000 a year at it. But his gambles were no longer concentrated on horses, the numbers, or shady insurance deals. Nowadays what he did was called investment. Mostly in real estate. Realtor's new well as the man who had almost bought the Empire State building. The almost in the equation stands for the moment when the shoe is straining broke. Joan had been following his career too, not because she had ever met him, but because for her, he was a type study and the evolution of what she called the extra legal ego. With personalities like that, respectability is a disease she told me. There's always an almost open conflict between the desire to be powerful and the desire to be accepted. Their ordinary criminal is a moral imbistible, but people like Brown are damped with the conscience, and sooner or later they crack trying to appease it. I sooner try to crack a Timken bearing, I said, Brown's 10 points steal all the way through. Don't you believe it? The symptoms are showing all over him. Now he's backing Broadway plays, sponsoring beginning actresses, joining playwrights groups. He's the only member of Bushkin and Brush, who's never written a play, acting in one, or so much as pulled the rope to raise the curtain. That's investment, I said. That's his business. Peter, you're only looking at the surface. His real investments, almost never fail. But the plays he backs always do. They have to. He's sinking money in them to appease his conscience, and if they were to succeed, it would double his guilt instead of solving it. It's the same way with the young actresses. He's not sexually interested in them. His type never is, because living a rigidly orthodox family life is part of the effort towards respectability. He's backing them to pay his debt to society, and other words, their talismans to keep him out of jail. It doesn't seem like a very satisfactory substitute. Of course it isn't, Joan had said. The next thing he'll do is go in for direct public service, giving money to hospitals or something like that. You watch. She had been right. Within the year, Brown had announced the founding of an association for clearing the Detroit slum area where he had been born. The plainest kind of symbolic suicide. Let's not have any more Abner Longman's Brown's born down here. It depressed me to see it happen. For next on Joan's agenda for Brown was an entry into politics as a fighting liberal, a new dealer 20 years too late. Since I'm mildly liberal myself when I'm off duty, I hated to think what Brown's queer are might tell me about my own motives. If I'd let it. All of which had nothing to do with why I was prowling around the Ludemilla. Where did it? I kept remembering Anderton's challenge. You can't take such a gamble. There are 8.5 million lives riding on it. That put it up into Brown's normal operating area, right? The connection was still hazy, but on the grounds that any link might be useful. I phoned him. He remembered me instantly, like most uneducated, power driven men. He had a memory as good as any machines. You never did send me that paper you're going to write. He said, has always seemed absolutely unchanged. Although he was in the 70s now, you promised you would. Kids don't keep the promises as well as they should, I said. But I've still got copies and I'll see to it that you get one this time. Right now I need another favor. Something right up your alley. CIA business? Yes? I didn't know you knew I was with CIA. Brown chuckled. I still know a thing or two, you said. What's the angle? I can't tell you over the phone, but it's the biggest gamble there ever was. And I think we need an expert. Can you come down to CIA's central headquarters right away? Yeah, if it's that big, if it ain't, I got a lot of business here, Andy. And I ain't going to be in town long. You sure it's top stuff. My word on it. He was silent, I'm a woman. Then he said, Andy, send me your paper. The paper, sure, but then I got it. I'd give him my word. You'll get it, I said. Thanks, Mr. Brown. I called headquarters and sent a message to my apartment to look for one of those long, dusty blue folders with a legal length sheets inside them, with orders to scorch it over to brown without stopping to breathe more than once. Then I went back myself. The atmosphere had changed. Anderton was sitting by the big desk, clenching his fists and sweating. His whole posture telegraphed his controlled helplessness. Cheney was bent over a seismograph, echo sounding for the egg through the river bottom. If that even had a prayer of working, I knew he'd have had the trains of the Hudson and Manhattan stopped. The rumbling course through their tubes would have blanked out any possible echo pit from the egg. While use chase, Joan said, scanning my face? Not quite. I've got something. If I can just figure out what it is. Number one shot brown? Yes. What's he got to do with it? Nothing, I said. But I want to bring him in. I don't think we'll look this project before deadline without him. What good is a professional game with our on a job like this? He'll just get in the way. I look toward the television screen, which now showed an A-Morphous Black Mass, jutting up from a foundation of even deeper black. Is that operation getting you anywhere? Nothing's gotten us anywhere, anderton interjected harshly. We don't even know if that's the egg. The whole area is littered with crates. Harris, you've got to let me get that alert out. Clark, how's the time going? Cheney consulted the stopwatch. Deadline in 29 minutes, he said. All right, let's use those minutes. I'm beginning to see this thing a little clear. Joan, what we've got here is a one shot gamble, right? In effect, she said cautiously. And it's my guess that we're never going to get the answer by diving for it. Not in time anyhow. Remember when the Navy lost a barge load of shells in the harbor back in 52? They scrabbled for them for a year and never pulled up a one. He finally had to warn the public that if it found anything funny looking along the shore, it shouldn't bang said object or shaker either. Or better equipped than the Navy was then, but we're working against a deadline. If you admitted that earlier, Anderson said, Horsley, we'd have half a million people out of the city by now, maybe even a million. We haven't given up, Colonel. The point is this, Joan. What we need is an inspired guess. Get anything from the Probseries Clark? I thought not. On a one shot gamble of this kind, the laws of chance are no good at all. So that matter, the so-called ESP experiment showed us long ago that even the way we construct random tables as full of holes. And that a man with a feeling for the essence of a gamble can make a monkey out of chance almost at will. And if there ever was such a man brown as it, that's why I asked him to come down here. I wanted to look at that lump on the screen and play a hunch. You're out of your mind, Anderson said. A decarous knock spared me the trouble of having to deny a form or ignore the judgment. It was brown. The messenger had been fast and the gambler hadn't bothered to read what a college student had thought of him 15 years ago. He came forward and held out his hand while the others looked him over frankly. He was impressive, all right. He would have been hard for a stranger to believe that he was aiming at respectability to the eye. He was already there. He was tall and spare and walked perfectly erect, not without spring despite his age. His clothing was as far from that of a gambler as you could have taken it by design. A black double-breasted suit with a thin vertical stripe, a gray silk tie with a pearl stick pin just barely large enough to be visible at all. A black humborg all perfectly fitted, all worn with proper casualness. One might almost say a formal casualness. It was only when he opened his mouth that one shot brown was in the suit with him. I come over as soon as you run or got to me, he said, what's the pitch, Andy? Mr. Brown, this is Joan Hademard, Clark Cheney, Colonel Anderton. I'll be quick because we need speed now. A Polish ship has dropped something out in the harbor. We don't know what it is. It may be a hellbomb or maybe just somebody's old laundry. Obviously we've got to find out which, and we want you to tell us. Brown's aristocratic eyebrows went up. Me? Hell, Andy. I don't know anything about things like that. I'm surprised with you. I thought CIA had all the brains that needed, and you got machines to tell your answers like that? I pointed silently to Joan, who had gone back to work the moment the introductions were over. She was still on the mic to the divers. She was saying, what does it look like? It's just a lump of something Dr. Hademard. Can't even tell it's shape. It's buried too deeply in the mud. Quulk, oin, oin, try the gager. We did, nothing but background. Sinelation counter, nothing Dr. Hademard, could be its shielded. Let us do the guessing monog. All right, maybe it's got a clockwork fuse that didn't break with the impact or a gyroscopic fuse. Stick a stethoscope on it and see if you pick up a ticking or anything that sounds like a motor running. There was a lag and I turned back to brown. As you can see, we're starting it. This is a long shot, Mr. Brown. One throw of the dice. One showdown hand. We've got to have an expert call for us. Somebody with a record of hits on long shots. That's why I called you. It's no good, he said. He took off the humble, took his handkerchief from his breast pocket, and wiped the hat band. I can't do it. Why not? It ain't my kind of thing. He said, look, I never in my life run out on anything that made any difference. But this makes a difference. If I guess wrong, then we're all dead ducks. But why should you guess wrong? Your hunch has been working for 60 years now. Brown, what is face? No, you don't get it. I wish you'd listen to me. Look, my wife and my kids are in the city. It ain't only my life, it's there's too. That's what I care about. That's why it's no good. On things that matter to me, my hunches don't work. I was stunned. And so I could see, or Joan and Cheney. I suppose I should have guessed it, but it had never occurred to me. Ten minutes, Cheney said, I looked up at Brown. He was frightened. And again, I was surprised without having any right to be. I tried to keep it at least my voice calm. Please try it any how Mr. Brown, as a favor. It's already too late to do it any other way. And if you guess wrong, the outcome won't be any worse than if you don't try it all. My kids, he whispered, I don't think he knew that he was speaking aloud. I waited. Then his eyes seemed to come back to the present. All right, he said, I told you the truth, Andy. Remember that. So is it a bomb or anid? That's what's up for grabs, right? I nodded. He closed his eyes. An unexpected stab of pure fright went down my back. Without the eyes, Brown's face was a death mask. The water sounds and the irregular ticking of a guy or counter seemed to spring out from the audio speaker. Four times as loud as before. I could even hear the pan of the seismograph scribbling away until I looked at the instrument. And so that Clark had stopped it probably long ago. Droplets of sweat began to form along Brown's forehead and his upper lip. The handkerchief remained crushed in his hand. Andreton said, of all the fool, hush, chown-side quietly. Slowly, Brown opened his eyes. All right, he said, you guys, wanted it this way. I say it's a bomb. He stared at us for a moment more. And then all at once, the Timken-Baring burst. Words poured out of it. Now you guys do something. Do your job like I did mine. Get my wife and kids out of there. Empty the city. Do something. Do something. Andreton was already grabbing for the phone. You're right, Mr. Brown. If it isn't already too late. Chaining shot out a hand and caught Andreton's telephone on by the wrist. Wait a minute, he said. What do you mean, wait a minute, haven't you already shot enough time? Chaining did not let go. Instead, he looked inquiring on me at Joan and said, one minute, Joan, he might as well go ahead. She nodded and spoke into the mic. Monog? Unscrew the cap. Unscrew the cap? The audio is squawked. But Dr. Hademard, if that sets it off, it won't go off. If the one thing you can be sure it won't do, what is this, Andreton demanded? And what's this deadline stuff anyhow? The caps off Monog reported were getting plenty of radiation now, just a minute. Yeah, Dr. Hademard, it's a bum all right. But it hasn't got a fuse. Now how could they have made a full mistake like that? In other words, it's a dud, Joan said. That's right, a dud. Now at last, brown wiped his face, which was quite gray. I told you the truth, he said, grimly, my hunches don't work on stuff like this. But they do, I said. I'm sorry we put you through the ringer. And you too, Colonel. But we couldn't let an opportunity like this slip. It was too good a chance for us to test how our facilities would stand up in a real bum drop. A real drop, Andreton said, Are you trying to say that CIA staged this? You ought to be shot the whole pack of you? No, not exactly, I said. The enemy's responsible for the drop all right. We got word less month from our man and Gidinia that they were going to do it, and that the bum would be unbored the loot miller. As I say, it was too good an opportunity to miss. We wanted to find out just how long it would take us to figure out the nature of the bum, which we didn't know in detail after it was dropped here. So we had our people in Gidinia, or defuse the thing after it was put on board the ship. But otherwise leave it entirely alone. Actually you see, your hunch was right on the button as hard as it went. We didn't ask you whether or not that object was a live bum. We asked whether it was a bum or not. You said it was, and you were right. The expression on Brown's face was exactly like the one he had worn while he had been searching for his decision. Except that, since his eyes were open, I could see that it was directed at me. If this that was the old days he said in an ice-cold voice, I might have made the Colonel's idea come true. I don't go for tricks like the Sandy. It was more than a trick, Clark put in. You remember we had a deadline on the test Mr. Brown. Obviously in a real drop, we wouldn't have all the time in the road to figure out what kind of a thing had been dropped. If we had still failed to establish that when the deadline ran out, we wouldn't have had to allow evacuation of the city with all the attendant risk that that was as exactly what the enemy wanted us to do. So, so we failed the test, I said. At one minute short of the deadline, Joan had the divers unscrupulous cap. In a real drop that would have resulted in a detonation if the bum was real. We'd never risk it. But we did it in the test was a concession of failure, an admission that our usual methods didn't come through for us in time. And that means that you were the only person who did come through Mr. Brown. If a real bum drop ever comes, we're going to have to have you here as an act of part of our investigation. Your intuition for the one-shot gamble was the one thing that they'll just out this time. Next time it may save 8 million lives. There was quite a long silence. All of us, entered and included, watched Brown intently. But as a pass of face failed to show any trace of how us thoughts were running. When he did speak at last, what he said must have seemed insanely irrelevant to Anderton and maybe to Cheney too. And perhaps it meant nothing more to Joan than the final clinical note in a case history. It's funny, he said. I was thinking of running for Congress next year from my district. But maybe this is more important. It was, I believe, the sigh of a man at peace with himself.

The Creeds of Christendom,Various,47754,6.0,"November 19, 2021",[],0,"it Libravox.org. Name and definition. A creed or rule of faith or symbol is a confession of faith for public use, or a form of words, or something forthwith authority certain articles of belief which are regarded by the framers as necessary for salvation, or at least for the well-being of the Christian church. A creed may cover the whole ground of Christian doctrine and practice, or contain only such points as our deemed fundamental and sufficient, or as have been disputed. It may be declarative or interrogative in form. It may be brief and popular as the apostles and the nice C.N.C.E.E.E. in creeds for general use in catacetical instruction and at baptism, or more elaborate and theological for ministers and teachers, as a standard of public doctrine, the symbolical books of the Reformation period. In the latter case, a confession of faith is always the result of dogmatic controversy, and more or less directly or indirectly, political against opposing era. Each symbol bears the impress of its age and the historical situation out of which it arose. There is a development in the history of symbols. They assume a more definite shape with the progress of biblical and theological knowledge. They are milestones and fingerboards in the history of Christian doctrine. They embody the faith of generations and the most valuable results of religious controversies. They still shape and regulate the theological thinking and public teaching of the churches of Christendom. They keep alive sectarian, stripes and antagonisms, but they reveal also the underlying agreement and foreshadow a possibility of future harmony. Origin of creeds. Faith, like all strong conviction, has a desire to utter itself before others. Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. I believe therefore I confess. There is also an expressed duty when we are received into the membership of the Christian Church, and on every proper occasion to profess the faith within us, to make ourselves known as followers of Christ, and to lead others to him by the influence of our testimony. This is the origin of Christian symbols or creeds. They never proceed faith by pre-suppose it. They emanate from the inner life of the church independently of external occasion. They would have been creeds even if there had been no doctrinal controversies. In a certain sense it may be said that the Christian Church has never been without a creed. The baptism of formula and the words of institution of the Lord's supper are creeds. These and the confession of Peter, and today to even the birth of the Christian Church on the day of pentacost. The church is indeed not founded on symbols but on Christ, not on any words of man but on the Word of God, yet it is founded on Christ as confessed by men, and a creed is man's answer to Christ's question, man's acceptance and interpretation of God's Word. Hence it is after the memorable confession of Peter that Christ said, thou art rocked upon this rock I shall build my church, as if to say, thou art the confessor of Christ, and on this confession as an immovable rock I shall build my church. Where there is faith, there is also a profession of faith. As faith without works is dead, so it may be said, also that faith without confession is dead. But this confession need not always be written much less reduced to a logical formula. If a man can say from his heart, I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, it is sufficient for his salvation. Acts 1631, the Word of God apprehended by a living faith which found that the Christian Church was at first Arale preached and transmitted by the apostles, then laid down in the New Testament Scriptures, as a pure and unearling record for all time to come. So the confession of faith or the creed was Arale taught and transmitted to the catacumons, and professed by them at baptism long before it was committed to writing. As long as the discipline of Aracani prevailed, the summary of the apostolic doctrine, called the rule of faith was kept confidential among Christians, and withheld even from the catacumons till the last stage of instruction. And hence we have only fragmentary accounts of it in the writings of the Antinice and Fathers. When controversies arose concerning the true meaning of the Scriptures, it became necessary to give formal expression of their true sense to regulate the public teaching of the Church and to guard it against error. In this way the creeds were gradually enlarged and multiplied even to the improper extent of theological treatises and systems of divinity. The first Christian confession or creed is that of Peter when Christ asked their apostles, who say ye that I am and Peter in the name of all the rest exclaimed as by divine inspiration, thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God, Matthew 1616. This became naturally the substance of the baptismal confession, since Christ is the chief object of the Christian faith. Philip required the unique simply to profess the belief that Jesus was the Son of God. In conformity with the baptismal formula, however, it soon took a trinitarian shape, probably in some such simple form as I believe in God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Gradually it was expanded by the addition of other articles into the various rules of faith of which the Roman form under the title, the apostles creed, became the prevailing one, after the fourth century in the West, and the Nicene creed in the East. The Protestant Church, as a separate organisation, dates from 1517, but it was not until 1530 that its faith was properly familiarised in the Augsburg confession. A symbol may proceed from the general life of the Church in a particular age without any individual authorship, as the apostles creed, or from an ecumenical council, the Nicene creed the creed of Calcidon, or from the synod of a particular church, the decrees of the Council of Trent, the Articles of Dord, the Westminster Confession and Catacusums, or from a number of divine's commissioned for such work by ecclesiastical authority, the 39 Articles of the Church of England, the Heidelberg Catacusum, the former Concord, or from one individual who acts in this case as the organ of his church or sect, the Augsburg Confession and Apology composed by the lengthen, the Articles of Smarl Carl, and the Catacusums of Luther, the second Hellvittic Confession by Bullinger. What gives them symbolical or authoritative character is the formal sanction or tacit acquiescence of the Church or sect, which they represent. In congregational and Baptist churches, the custom prevails for each local Church to have its own confession of faith, or covenant, generally composed by the pastor, and derived from the Westminster Confession or some other authoritative symbol drawn up independently.

The Story of the Beginning The people who lived long ago in the far off lanes of the north watched wonderful things that happened out of doors every day. Just as we do, but they did not know about the one loving God, who is the father of all, who made them in the world, and rose by his wise laws, so they thought there must be a great many unseen powers living in the clouds, in the wind, in the storms, and the sunshine, and doing all those wonders that no man could do. And so, those northern people who were our own forefathers came to believe in many gods, one for the sun, another for the thunder, another for the flowers, and so on. In the long-doubt winders, when the bright sun had gone away from them, this northman had time to think many thoughts about the powers of frost and wind in storms, which they called giants. In the used-to-tail stories and sing songs about the short-brace summer, the thawing out of the streams and lakes, the coming of the birds and flowers. With great joy, the people saw the bright sun-god, border, come back to them in the spring, after the long darkness, and knew that they all lived to his friendly, warm, and light. As we read the stories or myths, told by those people long ago, we can see that they were meant to tell about the world around us. At first, the stories were told, and sung from father to son, and that is, from one generation to another. Later, when people learnt how to write, these myths were written down, and kept with great love and care. This is the story they told of the beginning. At first, before living creatures were in the world, it was all rough in without order. Father, the north, it was very cold, for ice and snow were everywhere. To itself, there was fire, and from the meeting of the fire in the cold, a thick vapor was formed, from which sprang a huge giant. On looking about for some food, he saw a cow, who was also searching for something to eat. The ice tasted salt, and when the cow began to lick it, a head appeared. In the last, the whole figure of a god stood before her. From this two, the giant and the god came to great races of giants and gods, who were always enemies to each other. The giants were constantly trying to break into eschat, the home of the gods in the sky. The gods, on the other hand, watched him planned to keep out the giants, and to drive them back to their own stronghold, you got. In the whole world, where main women lived was between New God and Eschat. It was called Mekad. In a run this Mekad world, under the ocean, was called a monstrous serpent, who grew so long that his tail grew down his throat. He was called the Mekad serpent. On one foot tree, named Idrasel, connected all the worlds. This great eschat tree had his roots in Yucad, and the tops of his branches reached up so high as to overshadow Eschat. His three main roots were watered by three fountains. In the end of that, he set the wise giant, Mimmer, of home, which are here later. The nons, three sisters, also lived at the roots of Idrasel. And we carefully see that it was watered every day. A little gray squirrel was always running up and down the tree. Jackie is tail and harrying to tell the news to everyone along the way. He was so anxious to be the first one to carry the news that many times he brought trouble to himself and to others. Because he was not always careful to tell a story just as he had heard it, and often everyone would have been happier if the squirrel had kept the story quite to himself. The gods and goddesses all together were called the Eschat, and the chief and father of them all was olden. His lofty throne rose high in the midst of Eschat, the sacred city, which the gods have built for their beautiful home. From Eschat, arching over and down to the lower world was a ringable bridge called Breethers, the trembling bridge. Upon this, the dwellers in Eschat could travel every day or accept that mighty thought. His thunder chariot was too heavy for the trembling bridge, so he had to go around a long way. After the gods had made men and women, and had taught them to dwell on the earth, in the world of meekard, olden, not for one morning, from his heavenly seat, to see what further work was waiting for his helping hand. He noticed far away below him, a raise of small beams, some of them busy doing mischief is deeds, while others said idle doing nothing. Olden said for all these little people to come to him, and when they had reached Eschat, and were admitted to his palace of glazedheim, they entered the great judgment hall, where they found all the ashes sitting, with father olden at the head. Little people waited in the crowd near the door, wondering what was going to happen to them, while hammered the message of the gods, ran to his master to say that they had come. Then the old fathers spoke to the little dwarves about the evil deeds among men, and he told the naughtyest ones that they must go and lift down underground. And look after the great furnace fire in the middle of the earth to keep it always burning. Some must get cold to feed the fire, and others still will have charge of the gold and silver and precious stones under the rocks. Not one of these busy doors must ever appear during the day, only by night, by day, venture to leave their tasks. And now, set olden turned into the idle ones. What have you been doing? We were doing nothing at all, so we could not have harmed anyone, and we prayed to spare us, cried today. Do you not know that those who sit idle when they should be doing good, deserve punishment to set olden? I shall put you in charge of all the trees and flowers, and shall send one of the airs shared to teach you, so that you may be doing some good in the world. Then the little elves went to work among the flowers, and fried the bright gold of summer and sunshine, was a kind master to them. He taught them how to open the full buds in the sunshine, to fill the honey cups, and lead the bees along the flower passages to find their food, to hatch the birds' eggs, and teach the little ones their songs. In the night, to fetch the water for jute robes, to be hung on every leaf and blade of grass, when the work was finished, and the moon had risen, these busy elves and fairies enjoyed many a happy evening, dancing and frisking on the green by moonlight, and so our world of meekad was filled with busy work and play. Even now, in our time, the people in the lands of the north and in Germany have many old sayings and stories that have come down to them from the days long ago. There is a beautiful white flower in the north, which is called Bauders Brow, because it is so pure and bright, like the face of the deers and god Bauders. And in some places, where the farmers gather in the halfest of grain, they leave a little bunch of it standing in the field for father-oldens' halls. We have some English names to remind us of those old tales of our forefathers. For we have Tuesday, named for tier or two, the brave god who gave his right hand to save his friends, Wednesday or Wollenstay, named for olden. Thursday, for thaw, and thunder god, and Friday for either the goddess friggin or fri-a, or for fri, the god of summer, who ruled the fairies.

This story was first published in Worlds of If Science Fiction February 1959. It wasn't until the mermaid turned up in his bathtub that Simon grew seriously began to wonder what the Russians were doing on the roof next door. The old house next door together with his spacious, tall, papered roof which held a sort of pint shack, a cylindrical old water tank, and several chicken wiring closures had always been a focus of curiosity in this region of Greenwich Village, especially to whoever happened to be renting Simon's studio, the North Window Cumes Skylight of which looked down upon it. If you were exceptionally tall, or if like Simon used to halfway up a step ladder and peered. During the 1920s, old timers told Simon the house had been owned by a bootlecker, who had installed a costly pipe organ and used the water tank to store hooch. Later there had been a colony of shaving-headed Buddhist monks who had trolled about the roof in their orange and yellow robes, meditating and eating raw vegetables. There had followed a committee-a-del art theatrical group, a fencing salon, a school of the organ, the bootlecker's organ was always one of the prime-writting points of the house, an Arabian restaurant, several art schools and silvercraft shops, of course, and an existentialist coffee house. The last occupants had been two boni-cheat Swedish blondes, who sunbaids intermitably and had built the chicken wire in closures to cage a large number of sinister smoke-colored dogs. Simon decided they were breeding werewolves, and one of his most successful abstractions, Gray Hunger, had been painted to the inspiration of an eldritch-hawling. The dogs in their owners had departed abruptly one night in a closed van, without any of the dogs ever having been offered for sale, or either of the girls having responded with anything more than a raised eyebrow to Simon's brave greetings of a school. The Russians had taken possession about six months ago, for brothers apparently and one sister who never stirred from the house, but could occasionally be seen, peering grimily from a window. A white card with a bold inked, stooling-off Gorovich had been thumbtacked to the peeling, green painted front door. Lovkario smets the interior decorator, told Simon that the newcomers were clearly white Russians, he could tell by their bushy beers. Lester Flegums maintained that they were red Russians passing as white and talked alarmingly of spying sabotage in suitcase bombs. Simon, who had the advantages of living on the spot and having been introduced to one of the brothers, Vlossi, at a neighboring art gallery, came to believe that they were both red and white and something more. Solid complete slabs in any case. Double-dusty-usky Russians, if one may be permitted the expression. They ordered vodka, caviar, and soda crackers by the case. They argued inturmatively loudly and Russian, softly and English. They went on mysterious silent errands, they gloomed about on the roof, they made melancholy music with their deep harmonious voices and several large guitars. Once Simon thought they even had the bootlegger's organ going, but there had been a bad storm at the time and he hadn't been sure. They were not quite as tight lip as the Swedish girls. He only ate Kurt front sidewalk acquaintance developed and Simon came to know their names. There was Vlossi, of course, who were thick glasses, the most scholarly looking of a lot, and certainly the most biblis. Simon came to think of Vlossi as the vodka breather. Occasionally, he could be glimpse-tolding, or in mayor flasks, trays of cultured dishes, and other pieces of biological equipment, or absent-mindedly wiping off a glass slide with his beard. Then there was Ivan, the dauerist of the four, though none of them saved Lossi seemed very amiable. Simon's private names for Ivan were the nihilist and the bomber, since he sometimes looked about with a heavy globular leather case. With it, and his beard, a square black one, he had more than once created a mild sensation in the narrow streets of the village. Next there was Mikael, who were a large crucifix on a silver chain around his neck, and looked like a more spiritual respudon. However, Simon thought of him less as the religious than as the whistler, for his inviterate habit of whistling into his striking beard, a strange tune that obeyed no common harmonic laws. Sometimes Mikael seemed to carry a chilly breeze around with him, a permanent cold draft, so that Simon had to check himself in order not to clutch together his coat collar, whenever he heard the approach of the eerie piping. Far andly there was love, beardless, shard of my several inches, and certainly the most elusive of the brothers. He always moved at a scurry, frequently dipping his head so that it was sometimes before Simon assured himself that he had the stooling-off gorevic face. He did, unmistakably. Love seemed to be away on trips a good deal. On his returns he was frequently accompanied by furtive, but important looking men, a different one on each occasion. There would be much bustle at such times, among other things the shades would be drawn. Then, in a few hours, love would be off again, and if Manabout Town companion to. And of course, there was the indoors keeping sister. Several times Simon had heard one of the brothers calling Groshinga, so he assumed that was her name. She had these still look off good of its face, too, though on her almost incredibly, it was strangely attractive. She never ventured on the roof, but she often sat in the pent-shack. As far as Simon could make out, she always wore some dark Victorian costume, at least it had a high neck, long sleeves and puffed shoulders. Pale faced in the greenest gloom, she would stare for hours out of the pent-shack's single window, though never in Simon's direction. Occasionally, she would park and close her lips. But not exactly as she was speaking, at least aloud. He thought of calling her the bubble-blower. The effect was as odd as Mikael's whistling, but not as unpleasant. In fact, Simon found himself studying Groshingka for ridiculously long periods of time. His mild obsession began to urk him, and one day he decided henceforth to stay away altogether from his north window and the step ladder. As a result, he saw little of the alterations the Russians began to make on the roof at this point, though he did notice that they lugged up among other things a lift of large diameter, transparent, plastic piping. Oh, much further Russians now for the mermaid. Late one night, Simon started to fill his bathtub with cold water to soak his brushes and rags. He was working with that kind of calcimine, at the time, experimenting with portable murals painted on large, plastic-faced wooden panels. I've only laden he got back to the bathroom just in time to shut off the water, and to see a tiny fish of some sort splashing around in it. He was not unduly surprised. Fish up to four or five inches in length were not unheard of apparitions in the cold water supply of the area, and this specimen looked as if it displaced no more than a teaspoon of water. He made a lucky grab, and the next moment he was holding in his firmly-clenched right hand, the bottom half of a slim, wriggling creature, hardly two inches long, and now Simon was surprised indeed. To begin with, it was not greenish white, nor any common fish color, but palely pinkish flesh colored in fact. And it didn't seem so much a fish as a tadpole, at least it's visible half, at a slightly oversized head shaped like a bullet that was mushroomed a little, and two tiny, writhing arms or appendages of some sort, and it felt as if it had rather large hips for a fish, or even a tadpole. Equip a two-month human embryo with a finitale, give it in addition a precocious feminine sexiness, and you'd get something of the same effect. And all that was nothing. A tiny face, of course, and rather gogally gochli like a plenarians, but a face never the last, a human looking face, and also, here was the real trouble. A face that bore a grotesque but striking resemblance to that of Gruxin Castulicoff Gruxin, Simon's fingers tightened convulsively. Simultaneously, the slippery creature gave a desperate wriggle, yet shot into the air and a high curve, and fell into the scant inch of space between the bathtub and the wall. The next half hour was hectic in a groveling sort of way, retrieving anything from behind Simon's ancient claw-footed bathtub was a most difficult feat. There was barely space to get an arm under it, and at one point the warping of the floor boards prevented even that. Besides, there was the host of dust shrouded objects that had previously been too much trouble to tease out. An accumulation of decades. At first, Simon tried to guide himself by the faint flopping noises along the hidden base of the wall, but these soon ceased. Being on your knees and your chest, within ear against the floor, an enormous strainingly outstretched is probably not the best position to assume, while weird trains of thought go hooting through your head. But sometimes it has to happen that way. First came a remembered piece of neighborhood lore that supported the possibility of a connection between the house next door and the tiny pink aquatic creature now suffering minute agonies behind the bathtub. No one knew what ancient and probably lore-sany minded amateur plumber was responsible. But the old timers assured Simon, there was a link between the water supply of the Russians house with its aerial sister and that of the building containing Simon's studio and several smaller apartments. At any rate, they maintained that there was a time during the period when the bootlecker was storing hooch in the water tank, that several neighborhood coal water taps were dispensing a week but nonetheless authoritative mixture of bourbon and branch water. So thought Simon as he groved and strained. If the Russians were somehow responsible for this weird fishlatch, there was no insupportable difficulty in understanding how it might have gotten here. But that was the least of Simon's preoccupations. He scrabbled wildly and unsuccessfully for several minutes and then realizing he would never get anywhere in this unsystematic manner, he began to remove the accumulated debris piece by piece. Dark crackdons of soap, washraggs, dried out in tortured attitudes, innumerable dark-died cigarette stumps. Several pocket magazines with bleached wrinkled pages, empty and near empty medicine bottles and peel vials, rusty hairpins, bobby pins, safety pins, crumpled toothpaste tubes, and a couple for oil paint. A grey toothbrush, a 50 cent piece and several pennies, the mummy of a mocks, a letter from Picasso and last of all, from the door corner behind the bath tub's inside claw. The limp pitiful thing he was seeking. It was even tinier than he'd thought. He carefully washed the dust and flug off it, but it was clearly dead and its resemblance to Gruxchenka still Nikof Gorovich had become problematic. Indeed, Simon decided that someone seeing it now for the first time would think it would be a freak-minute or much-trust-adpull and nothing more, though mutation or disease had obviously been at work. The illusion of a miniature mermaid still existed in the tapering tail and arm-like appendages, but it was faint. He tried to remember what he knew about salamanders, almost nothing returned out. He thought of embryos, but his mind veered away from the subject. He wandered back into the studio carrying the thing in his hand. He climbed a step ladder by the north window and studied the house next door. What windows he could see were dark. He got a very vague impression that the roof had changed. After he had strained his eyes for some time, he fathed he could see a faint path of greenish luminescence streaming between the pent-shak and the water take. But it was very faint indeed and might only be his vision swimming. He climbed down the step ladder and stood for a moment, weighing the tiny dead thing in his hand. He decarted him that one of his friends at the university could dig up a zoologist to pass on his find. But Simon's curiosity was more artistic than scientific. In the end he twisted a bit of salafane around the thing, placed it on the ledge of his easel and went off to bed, and to a series of disturbingly erotic dreams. Next day he got up late and after breakfasting on black coffee, gloomed around the studio for a while, picking things up and putting them down. He clansed frequently at the step ladder but resisted the temptation to climb up and have another look next door. Signing he thumb tacked a sheet of paper to a drawing board and half hardily began blocking an automobile figure. It was in sippin' and lifeless, stabbing irritably at the heavy curve of the figureship, he broke his charcoal. Damn, he said, glaring around the room. A bad-dening all pretense he threw the charcoal on the floor and climbed the step ladder. He pressed his nose against the glass. In daylight, the adjoining roof looked bare and grimy. There was a big transparent pipe running between the water tank of the shack, braced in two places by improvised looking wooden scaffolding. Signing intently, Simon thought he could hear a motor going in the shack. The water looked salo-green. It reminded Simon of those futuristic algae forms where the stuff is supposed to be pumped through the transparent pipes to expose it to sunlight. There seemed to be a transparent top on the water tank too. There was too high for Simon to see, but there was a gleam around the edge. Staring at the pipe again, Simon got the impression there were little things traveling in the water, but he couldn't make them out. Climbing down in some excitement, Simon got the twist of cellophane from the ledge of the easel and stared at its contents. While the thoughts were tumbling through his head, as he got back up on the step ladder, some light flashed on the greenish water pipe between the tank and the shack. But after the first glance, he had no eyes for it. The ocean got still neck off, Gorovitch, at her face tragically pressed to the window of the shack. She was wearing the black dress with high neck and puffed shoulders. At that moment she looked straight at him. She lifted her hands and seemed to speak imploringly, then she slowly sank from sight, as if it horribly occurred to Simon into quicksand. Simon sprang from his chair, heart beating wildly and ran down the stairs to the street. Two or three passers by pause to study him, as he alternately pounded the flaking green door of the Russian's house and leaned on the button. Also, watching was the shirt-slave driver of a moving van, emblazoned, still neck off, Gorovitch enterprises, which almost filled the street in one of the house. The door opened narrowly. A man with a square-block beard frowned out of it, he topped Simon by almost ahead. Yes? I've been the bomber-est in a deep, excess-preided voice. I must see the lady of the house immediately, Simon cried, and your sister, I believe, she's in danger. He surged forward. The butt of the bombers right hand took him firmly in the chest and he staggered back. The bomber said, coly. My sister is a ha, taking a bath. Simon cried. In that case, she's drowning and surged forward again, but the bombers hand stopped him short. I'll call the police, Simon shouted flilling his limbs. The hand at his chest suddenly stopped pushing and began to pull. Gripped by the front of his shirt, Simon felt himself being drawn rapidly inside. Let go, help, I'll get napping! He shouted to the inquisitive faces outside before the door banged shut. No police rumble the bomber, assisting Simon upstairs. Now look here, Simon protested fusually, and the two-story-high living room to his right, the pipes of an organ gleamed golden from the shadows. By the second landing, a disheveled figure met them, glasses twinkling, glossy the vodka breather. He spoke croriously in Russian to Ivan, who replied shortly, then glossy turned and a three of them climbed up the narrow third flight to the pent shack. This housed a small, noisy machine, perhaps an eryter of some sort, for bubbles were streaming into the transparent pipe where it was connected to the machine, and under the pipe sitting with an idiot smile on a chair of red plushing gilt was a pale, black-bust-dashed man. An empty clear glass bottle with a red and gold label lay on the floor to suite. The opposite side of the room was hidden by a heavy plastic shower curtain. Ruxinka stulnikov, Gouravich, was not in view. Ivan said something explosive, picking up the bottle and staring at it, vodka. He went on, I have told you not to mix the pipe and the vodka. Now see what you have done. To be it seemed hospitable, said glossy within a apologetic gesture, but so I it's only one bottle. Ducking onto the pipe where he crossed the pent shack. Ivan picked up the pale man and dumped him cross-wise in the chair, with his patent lever shoes sticking up on one side, and his plump hands crossed over his chest. At him sleep, first we must take down all the apparatus before the capitolistic police arrive. Now what to do with this one. He looked at Simon and clenched one large and hairy fist. Niet, Niet, Niet, said the vodka breather, and went to whisper in Ivan's ear. They both stared at Simon who felt uncomfortable and began to back toward the door. But Ivan ducked Agile under the pipe and grasped him by the arm, pulling him effortlessly toward the roof exit. Just calm this way if you please, Mr. Gruyée, said glossy, hairy and after. As they left the shack, he picked up a kitchen chair. Crossing the roof, Simon made his sudden effort and wrenched himself free. They caught him again at the edge of the roof where he had run with nothing clearly in mind, but with his mouth open to yell. Suspended in the grip of the two Russians with Ivan's meaty palm over his mouth. Simon had a momentary glimpse of the street below. A third bearded figure, Mikael, their religious, was staring up at them from the sunny sidewalk. The melancholy face, the deep socketed tarmated eyes and the narrow beard tangled with the dangling crucifix, combined to give the effect of a told story novels dust jacket. As they hauled Simon away, he had the impression that a chilly breeze has sprung up and the street had dorkened. In his ears was Mikael's distant oddly discordant whistling. Grunting the two brothers set Simon down on the kitchen chair and slid him across the roof until something hard but resilient touched the top of his head. It was the plastic pipe through which, peering upward, he could see myriads of tiny polywalk shapes flitting back and forth. Do was a kindness not to make noise, said Ivan removing his palm. My brother Vlasi will now explain. He went away. Curiosity as much as shock kept Simon in his chair. Lossie bobbing his head and smiling sat down tail of our fashion on the roof in front of him. First I must tell you, Mr. Gruet, that I am specialist in biological sciences, here you see results of my most successful experiment. He was drew a round clear glass bottle from his pocket and unscrewed the top. Ah, said Simon tentatively. Indeed, yes, in my research, Mr. Gruet, I discovered a chemical which will inhibit growth at any level of embryonic development, producing a viable organism at that point. The basic effect of this chemical is always towards survival at whatever level of development once L. A. Blustie L. I worm a fish-safe for leger. This research, which I sinco scoffed that when I told him of it, I had no trouble in keeping secret. Though at the time I was working as the unhappy collaborator of the godless Soviets. But perhaps I am being too technical? Not at all. Simon is sure him. Gord, Vlossie said, with simple satisfaction and guilt that his bottle. Meanwhile, my brother and Mikhail was a religious brother at a monastery near Mount Athos. My nihilist brother, Ivan was in central Europe, while my third brother, Leav, who was of commercial talents, had preceded us to the new world, where we always felt it with some day be our destiny to join one another. With the aid of brother Ivan, I and my sister, Gruethingka, escaped from Russia. We picked up Mikhail from his monastery and proceeded here, where Leav had become a capitalist business magnate. My brothers, Ivan, especially, were interested in my research. He had a theory that we could eventually produce hosts and men in this way. Whole armies and political parties. All nihilist and all of them still need to go to the good of it. My sure him that this was impossible that I could not play, Cadmus, for free swimming forms or one thing. We have the way to feed them in the Aquius medium, but to make fully developed mammals, placental nourishment is necessary. That I cannot provide. Yet, to please him I began with pardon me, the egg of my sister, that was as good a beginning as any, and perhaps it intrigued my vanity. Ivan dreamed his dreams of nihilist still in the coffin of Gotovic humanity. It was harmless, as I told myself. Simon stared at him glassy-eyed. Something rather peculiar was beginning to happen inside his head, about an inch under the point where the cool water-filled plastic pipe pressed down on his scalp. Little ghostly images were darting. The lifefully whispered little girl things, smiling down at him impudently, then flirting away with the quick motion of their mermaid tails. The sky had been growing steadily, darker, and now there came the growl of thunder, against the purple grey clouds, Simon could barely make out the semi-transparent shapes of the polywags in the pipe over his head, but the images inside his mind were growing clearer by the minute. Ah, we have a storm. Vlassi observed as the thunder growl again. That reminds me of him, he was much influenced by our finished grandmother. He had the belief as a child that he could call up the winds by whistling for them. He even learned special wind musics from her. Later he became a Christian religious. There are great struggles in him. Mikhail objected to my research as when he heard, I used the egg of my sister. He said, we will produce millions of souls who are not baptized. I asked him how about the water they are in. He replied, this is not the same thing. These little swimmers will wiggle in hell eternally. This worried him greatly. We tried to tell him I had not used the egg of my sister only the egg of a fish. But he did not believe this, because my sister changed greatly at the time. She no longer spoke. She put on my mother's bathing costume. We are a family people, and retired to the bathtub all day long. I accepted this, at least in the water. She is not violent. Mikhail said, see her soul is now split into many unredeemed subsoles. One each for the little swimmers. There is a sympathy between them. A hypnotic vibration. So long as you keep them near her in that tank on the roof, this will be. If they were gone from there, far from there, the subsoles would reunite and grushing a soul would be won again. He begged me to stop my research, to dump it in the sea, to scatter it away, but lab and Ivan demanded I keep on. Yet Mikhail warned me that works of evil in the whirlwind. I am torn and undecided. He gulped at his vodka. Thunder growled louder. Simon was thinking, dreamily, that if the soul of grushing castoonikov could have itch, were split into thousands of subsoles by braiding hypnotically in the nearby water tank with at least one of them escaping as far as his bathtub. Then it was no wonder if Grushingka had a strange attraction for him. But that does not yet the worst of loss he continued. The hypnotic vibrations of the free swimming ones and their multitude turned out to have a stimulating effect on any male who is near. Their subminds and those dreams of the pick-hunter sort, left says that to make money for the work we must sell these dreams to rich men, I protest, but to no avail. Love is maddened for money, and I'll be side selling the dreams I find he plans to sell the creatures themselves. Sell them one by one, but keep enough to sell the dreams to. He does a madness. The darkness had become that of night. The thunder continued to growl, and now it seemed to Simon that it had music in it. Visions wham through his mind to its rhythm, horrors of swimming pick me souls of unborn water babies, migrations of miniature mermaids. The pipe hanging between water tank and pensheck became an imagination, a giant unbolicous or a canal for a much-dressed multiple birth. Sitting beneath it helpless to move, he focused his attention with the increasing pleasure on the active supple, ever for more human girl bodies that swam across his mind. Now more mermaid than tadpole, with bright smiling lips and eyes. Long, loralai hair, trailing behind them, they darted in hovered caressingly, in their wide chicked oval faces. He discovered without shock. There was a transcendent resemblance to the features of gruschenka stulnikov-gurivich, a younger, milk-skinned maiden of the steps, with challenging eyes and fingers that brush to kiss him with delightful shocks. So, it is for me the great problem, flussies distant voice continued. I see in my work only the pure research, the play of a mind. Love sees money, dive in sees dragon teeth, fodder for his political cannon, Mikhail sees un-sriven souls, gruschenka sees, who knows? Madness, it is indeed one great problem. Thunder came again, crashingly this time, the door of the pinch shack opened, framed in it stood Ivan the bomber. Vasey, he roared, do you know what that idiot is doing now? As the thunder of his voice trailed off together, Simon became aware of the identity of the other sound which had been growing in volume all the time. simultaneously blossy struggle to his feet, the organ he cried, Mikhail is playing the world-wind music. We must stop him. Pauzing only for a last pull of the bottle, he charged into the pinch shack following Ivan. When was shaking the heavy pipe over Simon's head, tossing him back and forth in the chair? Looking with it effort toward the west, Simon saw the reason. A spinning black pencil of wind that was writing its way toward them and wrecked across the intervening roofs. The chair fell under him, stumbling across the roof, he tugged futally at the door to the pinch shack, then threw himself flat, clawing at the tarp paper. There was a munked-ding roar, the top of the water tank went spinning off like a flying saucer. Momentarily, as if it were a giant syringe, the whirlwind dipped into the tank. Simon felt himself sliding across the roof, felt his legs lifting, he fetched up against the roof's low wall, and at that moment the wind let go of him and his legs touch to tarp paper again. Gaining his feet numbly, Simon staggered into the leaning pinch shack. The pale man was nowhere to be seen, the plus chair emptied. For curtain at the other side of the room had fallen with his rods, revealing a bathtub more antique than Simon's. In the tub, under the window, sat Krishna. The lightning flares showed her with her chin level with the water, her eyes placidly staring, her mouth opening and closing. When found himself putting his arms around the black-clad figure, with a straining effort he lifted her out of the tub, water sloshing all over his legs, and half carried, half slid with her down the stairs. He fetched up, panting, and disheveled at the top landing. His attention riveted by the lightning illuminated scene in the two story-high living room below. At the far end of it, a dark robe figure crouched at the console of the mighty organ, like a giant bat at the base of the portico of a black and gold temple. In the center of the room, Ivan was in the act of heaving above his head, his globular leather case. Mikael darted a look over his shoulder and sprang to one side. The projectile crashed against the organ. Mikael picked himself up, tearing something from his neck. Ivan lunched forward with a roar. Mikael crashed a fist against his jaw. The bomber went down and didn't come up. Mikael unwrapped his cruiser fixed from his fingers and resumed playing. With a wild cry, Simon heaved himself to his feet, stumbled over grissians because of sudden garments, and pitched headlong down the stairs. When he came to, the house was empty, and the still-knock-off moving van was gone. At the front door, he was met by a poker-faced young man, who identified himself as a member of the FBI. Simon showed him the globular case, Ivan had thrown at the organ, it proved to contain a bowling ball. The young gentleman listened to his story without changing expression, they can warmly ensued him out. The still-knock-off, good-a-vitches, disappeared for good, though not quite without a trace. Simon found this item in the next evening's paper. The first of many he accumulated, yearningly in a scrapbook, during the following months. The first of many, rain-a-hooks scientists declared. Millford Pennsylvania, the mermaid rain reported here has been declared a fraud by an imminent European biologist. Vlossi still-knock-off good-a-vitch, formerly professor of genetics at peer-university lawfium, passing through here on a cross-country trip, declared the miniature mermaid were albino-tat-poles, probably scattered about as a hoax by schoolboys. The professor added, are I would like to know where they got them, however? There is clear evidence of mutation, do perhaps, to fall out. Dr. Still-knock-off directed his party in a brief but intense search for overlook specimens. His charming silent sister, Krushenko Still-knock-off, wearing a quaint-laught-the-and-swimming cross-jume, explore the shallows of the Delaware. After collecting as many specimens as possible, the professor and his assistants continued their trip in their unusual camping car. Dr. Still-knock-off intends to found a biological research center in the calm and tolerant atmosphere of the west coast he declared.

The story was first published in a maconation stories of science and fantasy, April 1951. I got the bad news as soon as we landed on Morris. The minute I got off the spacer, the little yellow Marty was standing there with the yellow envelope. He said, gladiator Jack Gimsy. I admitted it and he handed me the envelope. It made me feel kind of good as though I was somebody important, which I'm not. I'd been taking plenty of guff on the trip, not only from Susie, but from Alger wild, who was also along. Yeah, between them they'd ridden me as well as the liner all the way from terror. I handed the Marty a copac and put the yellow envelope in my pocket as though I was used to getting spacer grams. I said to Susie. Let's hit the child line. I don't usually talk that fancy, but I was trying to impress her with my knowledge of antique phrases. Both Susie and Alger wild are students of ancient times and love to learn their conversation with such stuff. Susie said, sure, Jack, come on, Alger, which wasn't what I admitted all. And then she said, aren't you going to open that spacer gram jack? It might be important. Probably is. I said, carelessly. But it can wait, whatever it is. And it did. I opened it after we'd ordered at the space port restaurant. I should have waited until after I'd eaten, but I couldn't know that until I read. Spacer transporting Gladiator Earth Morris for interplanetary games lost. You have been appointed emergency replacement representing Earth. Good luck. I gulp'd. If you don't know all about the interplanetary meat, which is held every decade, then maybe you don't know why I gulp'd. If you do, you do. It's tough enough being a Gladiator on a terror, but at least you have a chance of coming out alive. You've even got a chance of winning. But at the interplanetary meat, however heard of a terror coming out in one piece, not to speak of winning. Or I'm a Gladiator, but I've always been strictly a second raider. In fact, some of the sports writers called me a third raider. Anyway, I've always worked in the smaller meats where the Gladiators, even when they lose, usually get off with their lives. In the small town, stuff they don't kill expensive Gladiators if they can help it. My head was doing double flips trying to figure out some way of making myself scarce when Susie said, what is it, Jack? Like a fool, I handed the message to her and she and Alcher read it together. Susie's eyes widened, and she started to say something, worriedly, but Alcher stuck out his hand and said, going to cry to the Lations, Jack. I knew you had great things in you. Now they'll be coming out. That is, just think. One of the three Gladiators representing Terra, what an honor. I was sunk. The interplanetary meat was just three days off, and I had three days to live. I wouldn't have been on Mars in the first place if it hadn't been for an argument. I had with Susie back on Terra just before she was scheduled to blast off for Mars to cover the interplanetary games. Susie is a sports reporter. She covers the meat from the women's angle. What she really wants to do was write books about primitive culture, and what I wanted her to do was spend the rest of her life being my wife. Neither of us seem to have too much of a chance of making good. As usual, Susie was given me a cut, if you were pardoned my language. I don't know why I bothered with you Jack as she said scouting. You had the book a week and don't know a thing about it. You're nothing but a drip. A square. Listen, I said resentfully. Don't use those mythological terms on me. Last time it took me all day to look them up. Besides, I try, don't I? My manager's going crazy because I've been spending so much time reading instead of training for my next meat. You get the idea. The girl was just gone on the agents. She wouldn't have tolerated me for an hour if I hadn't been willing to let her cram her nonsense into me at every opportunity. How long do you expect to be on Mars, my Esther? She shrugged, perhaps three months, Tara time. Three months. She padded my hand. Don't worry about me, Jack. I'm taking along an extensive microfilm library dealing with a literature and drama of 20th century North America. As you undoubtedly know, it reached its height in the comic books in cartoon movies of the time. Besides, she went on. Aljo Wilde will be there covering the meat from the society angle. He'll be good company. Aljo is quite an authority on prehistoric literature. And also, on today's women, I helped. You didn't tell me that Macron was going to be on Mars with you? She held her hands over her ears and said indignantly. Please, Jack, save your vulgarities for the games. I'm going with you, I grated. I don't trust that guy with my woman. She flared up at that. You're a woman? Let me tell you, Jack, Demcy, when you begin to display the cultural achievements of Aljo Wilde, you may begin just to begin mind you to think of me as your woman as you so crudely put it. Meanwhile, I have no desire to late myself with an ignorant, besides I'm beginning to believe that you have no interest in cultural pursuits. You merely deceived me these past months with pretended. Ah, Susie, I began. I had trouble enough raising credits for my fair, but more still, getting last-minute reservations on the crowded excursion liner tomorrow's. It took some string pulling on my manager's port to get me the tickets. Nobody who can raise the credits would dream of missing the interplanetary meat and every spacer tomorrow's was packed. Susie was surprised when I stepped up to her table in the spacer's lounge. That beast's terribor house raised. The little mix was as pretty as the Venucian rose-archid. She was sitting with Aljo Wilde and Macron from the word clorb. Hi, I said, using a prehistoric formal salutation, it hopes of pleasing her with my knowledge of old times. But I jove, Aljo Wilde exclaimed, if it isn't a jacked-demcy. The added smurking, pardoned the expression, jove was an ancient deity. I sometimes slip and use such terms. Did he think I was stupid? Hadn't I been reading up on all that stuff for months? I sat down casually in an empty acceleration chair. Of course, I said, an Egyptian god also known as Jupiter by their neighbors, the Aztecs, and by the name of Zeus by the Chinese. That's the way it was all the way to Morris. I tried to hang on and stick it out with him, but I came in a bad third. I was fighting out of my class. In fact, just before we arrived on Morris, Susie made it plain that she thought I might as well give up my attempts to become cultured. She said I just didn't assimilate this stuff, that it didn't come off on me. I could read the whole library of the ancient classics that I recall none of the significance of what I'd read. In short, I wasn't doing so good with Susie. Well, three days after getting the telegram, I met the other two gladiators from Terra in our dressing room at the arena. They weren't much happier about the meat than I was. It's one of the occupational hazards of our trade. If you get too good, you'll probably be chosen as Terra representative to the interplanetary meat, and your chances of surviving are almost nil. Of course the pay is high, and your survivors get a big chunk of credits, but it's a chilly prospect at best. The other two were pretty well armored and had chosen spirits as weapons, but I left off all armor and took a short sword. I planned on moving fast, and the less weight I carried the better. When the various preliminaries were over and the crowd shouting for the main event, we tried it out to the field, joined the gladiators from the other planets and perrated toward the stand at which the judges and diplomats were seated. There was a mob of these, each with his assistance and secretaries. You could bet that little that happened would miss them. After all, on this meat hung the destinies of planets. Thousands of spectators from every planet and every principle satellite in the system stared down from their arena seats. I knew that the majority of them had expended a fortune in transport from their homes and for tickets to the meat. But why not? It was the equivalent of having a box seat at a full-scale war of the type held in legendary times. Certainly, the ultimate effect was as great or greater. Each spectator knew that upon the matter in which their planets represented if fought this day, their fate's depended. The planets have long since abolished war, but they put great store by these interplanetary meats. But there is, why fight a war when kill of billions of population when you can figure out before the fighting ever takes place who'd win? It's the natural ultimate development of diplomacy. Everything is settled by the diplomats without resorting to armed conflict. Suppose for instance that Mars decided to assume domination of terror. She notes, as do the terror and diplomats, that, at the interplanetary meat, the marching gladiators wiped up on those from terror. Obviously, if the same fighting would take place on a gigantic scale, the same thing would result. So why fight the war? Terror simply accepts the domination. Of course it's all done in very diplomatic language so that nobody loses face, but the results are the same. As a matter of fact, I'm surprised that one of the other planets hasn't already taken over terror. The most recent addition to the League of Solar System planets, whereby far the weakest. Probably our strongest defense has been the fact that several different league members have had their eyes upon us and each has counteracted the other. It's certain that Venus, Saturn, or even Pluto would like to assimilate terror. Actually, any one of them could do it. As his customary abutie from the planet upon which the meat is being held, a Martian princess in this case, opened the main event by throwing out the prize. It was a tremendous phonucy and emerald, the largest ever discovered of the size of a man's hand. It doesn't really make much difference who catches the prize, except that it's considered to be a lucky sign. The gladiator who survives to contest is the one who finally takes it. I could see Susie in the pressbox sitting next to Alcher, she seemed pale. I thought I might as well show her that some of the stuff she'd given me to read had been remembered. So just before the princess tossed out the emerald and while the others stood about nervously and impatient. I drew my sword, flourished it and called out, we who are about to die, salute you. The Martian princess smiled down at me. Good fortune to you, gladiator from Tera, she said, and deliberately through the stone. I just as well she hadn't. The man with the prize is always a center of conflict and to have a hundred or so of the most efficient killers in the system out after you is no way to live to a ripe old age. But I caught the emerald and the battle was on. I'd hardly got it into my belt before I heard a swish and a Maccurian bouncer, the steel knives on his heels flashing, missed me by a fraction of an inch. Before he could jump again, a forearmed Martian pierced it with a javan. The Martian went down and turned under a crushing blow from a slover. Why ran backwards quickly knowing that where there is one bouncer, there is another? They fight in a group of 20 or 30. Sometimes I wonder about that rule. Each planet is represented in the final free for all, the climax of the interplanetary meat by weight. The invicurians who are all about the size of Tera and chickens have 30 gladiators in the battle. The group from Colipso numbers 8 and looks like a gang of human dwarfs. Jupiter and Saturn have only one represented in each because of their gigantic size. Morris has four, Tera three, the others have very e-numbers. The other two gladiators from Tera tried to cover me but went down in the rush. The first fell victim to the heavy, ponderous and nearly weapon proof gladiator from Saturn, the victor of the last interplanetary meat. The Tera and Tera running close but ate the other's guard but was smashed with a sweeping blow that broke half the bones in his body. The crowd cheered for the nice dry. At the Saturnian, Brenished his half-toned club again, peered about near sightedly for another enemy. My second companion in arms had an arm severed near the shoulder by a fast moving plutonian and got a boot. He fell to the ground bleeding profusely, at least he probably survived and get back to Tera. I have seconds to live. As I said, her wee Teraans don't show up so well in the games. The gladiators from any planet can take us. Oh, I don't mean that a Teraan couldn't defeat one Maccurian bouncer or one Colipso dwarf. But face our three Teraans with a whole Colipso or the whole Maccurian delegation and we don't last very long. I had seconds to live. They were all centering toward me, taking sides wipes at one another if the opportunity allowed, but heading for me. Ordinarily before a contest, my manager fills me full of last-mended advice and instructions, but I'd hardly seen him in the past few months. I've been too busy reading Susie's books about the ancients. I was on my own. I didn't have time to figure it out. It just happened automatically. I remembered something and before I had time to place the memory, I had taken the emerald from my belt, held it up momentarily so they could all see it and yelled, for the greatest fight-or-a-vol, and threw it into the midst of them. Later I recalled a guy in one of Susie's books having done something similar, except I believe he yelled for the fairest and through a golden apple. At any rate the results seem to be about the same. That guy started the Trojan War. It gave me a breathing spell. They piled on one another until I thought the meat would end then and there. A venousian spider-man bent to pick up the emerald and had five of his limbs and his head cut off before he could straighten again. A gut-a-boot grabbed it and tried to dart out of the crush, but ran into the darting rapier of a uranium, rising dust swirled up and enveloped the rest. In moments the fight had settled down into a series of individual combat all over the field. I could see the slow moving slover from Jupiter's stalking about weaponless, seizing and crushing all with whom he came in contact. I could see the Maccurian bonkers dying like flies, but killing their share and more of opponents with the razor-sharp spurs attached to their feet. They would fling themselves high into the air and come down from above heels slashing death. I had no more time to observe. Five remaining collapse so dwarfs disengaged themselves from a fight centering about two venousians, spied me and dashed in my direction. Ordinary, the collapse of gladiators would be even weaker than we Terrence, but they have the advantage of a universal mind that is, they think together. Each knows what every other dwarf is thinking. It goes beyond mere mental telepathy. They act as though they were a single individual. Talk about teamwork. You get three or four of them about you, all working incomplete in perfect harmony and you are sunk. I groaned from my managers advice again and resigned myself. When they got within 15 feet of me they opened their mouths and cried in unison. Be pair to die, Terrence, muckrun, for a second that did it. I raised my short sword and started toward them. They spread out like a fan to encircle me. Once again I didn't consciously figure it out. The idea came spontaneously without my acting upon it. I suddenly turned on my heel and started to run. They followed me like a pack. I'd gotten halfway across the arena and could hear the thousands of the arena seats buoy me like thunder before it came back to me what I'd read. It was a trick some gladiator from Rome or Greece had pulled once. I looked over my shoulder. Sure enough they were still coming, but now they were strung out in a line. The fastest runner of them all was only a short distance behind me, the slowest, quite a waste back. The other three were in between at varying distances. This next is going to sound like it took some time, but actually it was over in split seconds. I stopped, world, and said tightly to the one pressing me, who's calling you a muckrun now. At the same time my sword parried his and ripped into his unprotected belly. He died, his eyes wide with surprise and pain. I hardly had time to disengage my sword before the second warf was upon me. I dropped to one knee and slashed upward, cutting completely through his right arm. The arm fell to the ground, his hand still clutching the three pronged javanolin with which he'd expected to spit me. He screamed in agony and stumbled away, hopelessly trying to staunch the flow of blood with his left hand. The third came running up, both hands high over his head, ready to bring down his battleaxe. I kicked him savagely with a spiked shoe, cracking in he and bringing him to the ground. I could have finished him then and there, but didn't have the time. The fourth, yelling like a maniac, slashed into me, his blade ripping my right arm from elbow to shoulder. He brought up his sword for another stroke. I was short-winded from the long run across the arena and from the fast action of the past few moments. I drew all my strength together and lunged desperately forward, my sword pierced his throat. He fell, writhing, taking my blade with him. I stood up weirdly to confront the fifth one. My arm was bleeding freely and I had no weapon nor time to get one. He came shouting, raging with blood lost in desire for revenge. His arm flew back for the javanolin cast, when a plutonian gallaboot shot out from a nearby melee and struck him from the rear. The dwarf collapsed, bleeding his life away in moments. The gallaboot strained up, shrilling its death whistle, preparatory to darning at me. But a Maccurian bouncer wounded and fluttering came down from above and made a last desperate stroke. They died together. I shook my hand to clear it and reached down to disengage my sword from the neck of the fallen dwarf I'd killed last. I looked about. There were no others near me. For a moment there was a breathing spell. In the past 10 minutes, two thirds of the contestants had either died or been carried off the field incapacitated. Those of us that remained were wounded but still in the fight. That's I stood there staggering, panting, aching. Get a car to me that never before had a terror unlessed its soul long in an interplanetary meat. As though by common consent, we all gravitated toward the center of the arena. This was it, and the next few moments the contest would be over. And so would I. As I stumbled forward, they wounded Martian staggered to his feet and made a half-hearted stab at me. I bypassed him. He was too far gone to fight. Shortly, the judges' assistants would get to him and take him from the field, possibly he'd have a chance to survive. I had no desire to finish him off, in fact, high in beat him. We were quiet momentarily, and so was the crowd. A hush hung over the whole arena. I noted in seconds that among the survivors were two of the four limbed Martians, half a dozen bouncers, V. Gigantic slobber from Jupiter. One of the collapse's almost helpless now that is fellow to our all gone. Three are four goddabuts, and a venousian spider-man. I wondered vaguely if my name's sake that gladiator of the famous state of the legendary United States, the original Jocker-Dimcy, had ever found himself in a spot like this. I suppose that he had, possibly worse. Susie, who gave me the name, saying that it would be good for publicity, blamed he was one of the greatest of all. I shook my head again, trying to clear it. My loss of blood making me faint. And then it broke. The dust swirled high as we rushed together. I felt a crushing blow, tried to deal one back, was struck again by the ponderous gladiator from Jupiter, and was thrown heavily to the ground. I tried to push myself to my knees, my already bloody sword still in hand, still at the ready. I was in the center of the crush. This was the end. Susie flashed before my mind. Well, there was a tremendous controversy afterward, and I was brought before the judges and the diplomats, more like a prisoner than the victor of the interplanetary meat. I was laden down with bandages and weak from loss of blood, but they didn't look in the least sympathetic, not even the judge and diplomats from terror. They got right to the point. The Morrison judge, as senior, since the meat was taking place on his planet, acted as spokesman. He was excited and indignant, and would wave three or four of his arms at a time to emphasize his point. I thought vaguely of one of the old and time windmills I've seen pictured in one of Susie's books. Gladiator, Jacques Gempsey, he wrapped, our tendency is to rule your conduct in the Afree so unbecoming that not only will the prize not be awarded you as last, ending contestant on the field, but we are considering I wasn't having any. If the company threw that scrap, I wasn't ever figuring on taking a back seat again. I interrupted him, growling. I'm willing to stand behind anything I did in the arena on the ground that it was compatible with terror and custom, and therefore allowable on the part of a terror and gladiator. The Venucian judge sneered without bothering to say anything. The plutonian titerate his disbelief, the terror and judge blinked at me, shocked by my words. I was getting mad. In the press box, you'll find two reporters from terror, bring them here. They are both students of terror and history and ancient custom, and will support what I say. Susie and Aljewild were located and brought before us after a brief debate between the judges. By their appearance, there was obvious that the press box boys had similar ideas to those of the judges. Susie showed signs of concern about my wounds, and she also half indicated that I was a lover. There was no half about it as far as Aljewild was concerned. You might have died like a man, Devcy. He said sharply, instead of bringing disgrace to terror. The Martian judge said to Colley, that the escalator claims that his astounding actions in the arena were excusable on the grounds that everything he did is in accord with terror and customs and consequently, permissible by the rules of the interplanetary meat. Susie's eyes widened. Aljewild began to protest. I didn't give them a chance to deny anything. What are the complaints I asked the judge? As though they weren't obvious, he snorted beginning to wave his arms again. First, your trick of throwing the emerald, the princess was so kind to honor you with into the midst of the others, and thus diverting the strife from yourself. This was an act of strategy. I interrupted him. The custom is to be found in terror and history, and all maximum of the Su Indians was deviding conquer. That's what I did. I got my opponents defiding among themselves so that I could defeat them easier. The Romans, not the Su Indians, Aljewild. Then you mean that this was actually a maximum of terror? The judge said in surprise. I could see the other judges and diplomats, including those from Earth were shocked as the Martian. Well, yes, Suzy told him. Of course they usually don't use quite the method that Jack did. The judge snorted again. Be that as it may. I don't see how dimsy can justify his fleeing before the Colipsock gladiators like I come and coward. Meet rules or that each gladiator must fight any who oppose him. Suzy shot a worried look at me. I fight in a card with terror and history and custom. I said decisively. For one thing, it was always a basic rule with a terror in general to choose the battlefield where the fight was to be joined. It was considered a major advantage. Another maximum was get their fustus with a mostus. I merely ran to the ground that best suited me. And then, when the Colipsock dwarfs were no longer the mostus, I fought them one at a time. The judge raised his eyes questioningly at Aljorn with rewarded with a grudging nod. The Martian shook his head as though in disbelief but went on. These two matters you have explained surprisingly but acceptably. But to this last charge that can be no possible, honorable, background in terror and custom. The first effect that in the final conflict, you fell as though dead and remained on the ground until the other contestants had all but eliminated each other. When only the badly wounded slumber and the half dead of Nuziyan gladiator remained, you got up again and re-entering the fight, finished off these opponents. The judge threw up his forehands in horror. Luckily you can't claim justification for that not on any grounds, not by and I still up his straight and defiantly as my heavy bandages would allow. Listen, I grould. It's one of the oldest traditions of terror. It's called playing possum. For a full minute silence fell on the whole group. Then I could hear one diplomat whisper questioningly to another, playing possum. What does that mean? And then, with one of the most outstanding bits of pure statesmanship the system has ever seen, Susi took up the cue and spoke in collaboration. He's quite right. Playing possum is in full accord with terror and custom. Why, she added innocently, earth always acts in that manner. She pretends she's weak, helpless, someone to be ignored and then suddenly and without warning, she shows her full strength. The various judges and diplomats shot glances at each other from the side to their eyes, especially those from Venus, Saturn, and Pluto. The terror in judge was no macron. When somebody yelled gorm, he knew enough to grab the gaboot and run with it. He looked at Susi and I severely. I know more, either of you, you are not here to reveal terror and secrets. The other diplomats, I'd each other again, nervously. The Martian judge, more genial now, said, none, undoubtedly, a mistake has been made due to our lack of knowledge of terror and customs and practices. The Emerald shall be awarded the terror and gladiator, Jack Dimsey, as soon as it is found. It is undoubtedly still in the arena in the possession of some slain contestant. I took it from my belt. As a matter of fact, I have it here. I pick it up while playing possum under that heap of corpses. It's an old custom handed down from a Terran city named Brooklyn. When you see something that ain't nailed down, latch onto it. All-Jour Wild left the room hurriedly, followed hand in hand by Susi and I. It was time for the diplomats to begin their wrangling, the wrangling that was settled the fate of worlds. As we pass through the door, I could see the anticipation on the faces of the diplomats from terror. From what I heard later, they must have given the other diplomats curt, if you pardon my language.

Eight that a man may lawfully swear when he speaks nothing but the truth and swear by nothing but that which is good as by his faith or truth. Nine that a preacher is a good man no longer than he is in the pulpit. They think all like themselves.

These and such like sayings what argue they but your gross ignorance. Now where ignorance reigneth their reigns sin and where sin reigns they are the devil rules and where he rules men are in a damnable case. He will reply unto me thus that he are not so bad as I would make you. If need be you can say the creed the Lord's prayer and the ten commandments and therefore you will be of God's belief. Say all men what they will and you defy the devil from your hearts. I answer again that it is not sufficient to say all these without book unless you can understand the meaning of the words and be able to make a right use of the commandments of the creed of the Lord's prayer by applying them inwardly to your hearts and consciences and outwardly to your lives and conversations. This is the very point in which he fail. And for help in this your ignorance to bring you to true knowledge, unfained faith and sound repentance here I have set down the principle points of Christian religion in six plain and easy rules, even such as the simplest may easily learn. And here unto is a joined and exposition of them word by word. If you do want other good directions then use this my labour for your instruction. In reading of it first learn the six principles and when you have them without book and the meaning of them with all then learn the exposition also. Which being well conceived and in some measure felt in the heart you shall be able to profit by sermons whereas now he cannot and the ordinary parts of the catacus amnamely the ten commandments the creed the Lord's prayer and the institution of the two sacraments shall more easily be understood. Lying in Christ Jesus will imperkinze. The foundation of Christian religion gathered into six principles. Question. What does our belief concerning God? One. There is one God, creator and governor of all things, distinguished into the father, the son and the Holy Ghost. Question. What does our belief concerning man and concerning thy known self? Two. All men are wholly corrupted with sin through Adam's fall and so are become slaves of Satan and guilty of eternal damnation. Question. What means is there for thee to escape this damnable state? Three. Jesus Christ the eternal son of God being made man by his death upon the cross and by his righteousness have perfectly alone by himself accomplished all things that are needful for the salvation of mankind. Question. But how may I now be made partaker of Christ and his benefits? Four. And then of a contrite and humble spirit by faith alone, apprehending and applying Christ with all his merits unto himself is justified before God and sanctified. Question. What are the ordinary means for the obtaining of faith? Five. Faith come with only by the preaching of the word and increase the daily by it and also by the administration of the sacraments and prayer. Question. What is the estate of all men after death? Six. All men shall rise again with their own bodies to the last judgment which being ended, the godly shall possess the kingdom of heaven but unbelievers and reprobates shall be in hell tormented with the devil and his angels forever. Exposition of the principles. One. Question. What is God? Answer. God is a spirit or a spiritual substance most wise, most holy, eternal infinite. Question. How do you persuade yourself that there is such a god? Answer. Beside the testimony of the scriptures, plain reason will show it. Question. What is one reason? Answer. When I consider the wonderful frame of the world, me thinks the silly creatures that be in it could never make it. Neither could it make itself and therefore besides all these, the maker of it must need to be God. Even as when a man comes into a strange country and sees fear and some to his buildings and yet finds no living creatures there besides birds and beasts, he will not be imagined that either birds or beasts reared by those buildings but he presently conceived that some men either were or have been there. Question. What other reason have you? Answer. A man that commits any sin as murder, fornication, adultery, blasphemy, etc. albeit he does so concealed a matter that no man living know of it yet oftentimes he have a griping in his conscience and feels the very fleshings of hellfire which is a strong reason to show that there is a god before his judgment seat he must answer for his fact. Question. How many gods are there? Answer. No more but one. Question. How do you conceive this one god in your mind? Answer. Not by framing any image of him in my mind, as ignorant folks do that think him to be an old man sitting in heaven but I conceive him by his properties and works. Question. What be his chief properties? Answer. First he is most wise, understanding all things are right and knowing the reason of them. Secondly he is most holy which appear in that he is most just and merciful unto his creatures. Thirdly he is eternal without either beginning or end of days. Lastly he is infinite, both because he is present in all places and because he is of power sufficient to do whatsoever he will. Question. What be the works of god? Answer. The creation of the world and of everything therein and the preservation of them being created by his special providence. Question. I know you that god governor for every particular thing in the world by his special providence. Answer. To omit the scriptures I see it by experience. Meet drink and clothing being void of life could not preserve the life of man unless there were a special providence of god to give virtue unto them. Question. How is this one god distinguished? Answer. Into the father which begot of the son, into the son who is begot not the father, into the holy ghost who precedeeth from the father and the son. To. Question. Let us now come to ourselves and first tell me what is the natural estate of man. Answer. Every man is by nature and dead in sin as a loathsome carrion or as a dead corpse life rotting and stinking in the grave. Question. What is sin? Answer. Any breach of the law of god if it be no more but the least one to that which the law require of. Question. How many sorts of sin are there? Answer. Sin is either the corruption of nature or any evil actions that precede of it as fruits thereof. Question. In whom is this corruption of nature? Answer. In all men. None accepted. Question. In what part of man is it? Answer. In every part both of body and soul. Like as a leprosy that runeth from the crown of the head to the soul of the foot. Question. Show me how every part of man is corrupted with sin. Answer. First in the mind there is nothing but ignorance and blindness concerning heavenly matters. Secondly the conscience is defiled being always either be numbed with sin or else turmoil with inward accusations and terrors. Thirdly the will of man only willeth and lusteth after evil. Fourthly the affections of the heart as love joy hope, desire, etc. are moved and stirred to that which is evil to embrace it and they are never stirred under that which is good and there should be too assured. Lastly the members of the body are the instruments and tools of the mind for the execution of sin. Question. What be those evil actions that are the fruits of this corruption? Answer. Evil thoughts in the mind which come either by a man's own conceiving or by the suggestion of the devil. Evil motions and lusts stirring in the heart and from these arise evil words and deeds when any occasion is given. Question. how come it that departs that all men are thus defiled with sin? Answer. By Adam's infidelity and disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit even as we see great personages by treason do not only hurt themselves but also stain their blood and disgrace their posterity. Question. What hurt comes to man by his sin? Answer. He is continually subject to the curse of God in his lifetime and in the end of his life and after this life. Question. What is the curse of God in this life? Answer. In the body, diseases, aches, pains in the soul, blindness, hardness of heart, horror of conscience, in goods, hindrances and losses, in name, ignominy and reproach, lastly in the whole man, bondage under Satan the Prince of Darkness. Question. What manner of bondages this? Answer. This bondage is when a man is the slave of the devil and have him to reign in his heart as his guard. Question. How may a man know whether Satan be his guard or not? Answer. He may know it by this if he give obedience to him in his heart and express it in his conversation. Question. And how shall a man perceive this obedience? Answer. If he take delight in the evil motions that Satan puts into his heart and do fulfill the lust of the devil. Question. What is the curse due to man in the end of his life? Answer. Death which is the separation of body and soul. Question. What is the curse after this life? Answer. Eternal damnation in hellfire where all of every man is guilty and is in as great danger of it as the traitor apprehended is in danger of hanging drawing and caultering. Three. Question. If damnation be the reward of sin, then is a man of all creatures most miserable. A dog or a toad when they die, all their misery is ended, but when a man die, there is the beginning of his woe. Answer. If there were so indeed, if there were no means of deliverance, but God has showed his mercy in giving a savior to mankind. Question. How is the savior called? Answer. Jesus Christ. Question. What is Jesus Christ? Answer. The eternal son of God made man in all things, even in his infirmities like other men, save only in sin. Question. How is he made man void of sin? Answer. He was conceived in the womb of a virgin and sanctified by the Holy Ghost at his conception. Question. Why must our savior be both God and man? Answer. He must be a man because man have sinned and therefore a man must die for sin to appease God's wrath. He must be God to sustain and uphold the manhood to overcome and vanquished death. Question. What be the officers of Christ to make him an all-sufficient savior? Answer. He is a priest, a prophet, a king. Question. Why is he a priest? Answer. To work the means of salvation in the behalf of mankind. And how do he work the means of salvation? Answer. First by making satisfection to his father for the sin of man, secondly by making intercession. Question. How do he make satisfection? Answer. By two means and the first is by offering a sacrifice.

How did he fulfill the law? Answer. By his perfect righteousness which consists of two parts. The first, the integrity and purness of his human nature.

Once up I am assured of it, first because the Holy Ghost persuade with my conscience that it is so, secondly I see it by experience for the preaching of the Scriptures have the power of God in them to humble a man when they are preached and to cast him down to hell and afterwards to restore and raise him up again.

Question, how come if it departs that many after their baptism for a long time feel not the effect and fruit of it and some never? Answer, the fault is not in God who keeps his covenants but the fault is in themselves in that they do not keep the condition of the covenant to receive Christ by faith and to repindible their sins. Question, when shall I man then see the effect of his baptism? Answer, at what time, so ever he'd asked for a safe Christ by faith, though it be and hundred years after, he shall then feel the power of God to regenerate him and to work all things in him which he offered in baptism. Question, how if a man never keep the condition to which he bound himself in baptism? Answer, his demnation shall be the greater because he breaketh his vow made to God.

Answer, at the sound of a trumpet, the living shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye and the dead shall rise again every one of them with his own body and all shall be gathered together before Christ and after this the good shall be severed from the bed, the standing on the left hand of Christ the other on the right. Question, how will Christ try and examine every man's cause? Answer, the books of all men's doing shall be laid open and every man shall be tried by the works which he did in his lifetime because they are open and manifest signs of faith or unbelief. Question, what sentence will he give? Answer, he will give sentence of salvation to the elect and godly but he will pronounce sentence of damnation against unbelievers and reprobates. Question, what stage shall the godly be in after the day of judgment? Answer, they shall continue forever in the highest heaven in the presence of God having full fellowship with Christ Jesus and raining with Him forever. Question, what stage shall the wicked be in after the day of judgment? Answer, in eternal position and destruction in hellfire. Question, what is that? Answer, it stands in three things especially, one a perpetual separation from God's comfortable presence, two fellowship with the devil and his angels, three, and horrible pang and torment both of body and soul arising of the feeling of the whole wrath of God poured forth on the wicked forever, world without end.

5 SF stories by Mack Reynolds,Mack Reynolds,73443,4.0,"June 30, 2021",[],0," volunteer, please visit Librevox.org. 5 science fiction stories by Mac Reynolds. Story number 1, Mercy Flight. The story was first published in Planet Stories July 1951. The phone rang and Ed Harry was doing anything so he picked it up and said, yeah, he said, yeah, a few more times. His eyes widening infant, testimony each time, and finally wound up with, okay, money. He hung up and said, that was money, up in O'Neonton. She says a guy is coming in from Luna with a kid for a emergency hospitalization, radiation burns or something. Drake was sitting back in his swivel chair, his feet on the desk and his hands clasped behind his head. He growled. That's the trouble with women in this game. They've got no story since. She foams all the way from O'Neonton on a story that's been run a hundred times. Every time somebody gets good and sick up on Luna, they bring them to Earth for treatment. He shrugged. Okay, so it's a kid this time. Do up about a stick up at Carrienne, we'll put it on page three if you can work it into a tear jerker. Ed Carri said, you didn't let me finish, Drake. Something's wrong with this guy's radio. Somebody on the rewrite desk said, something wrong with his radio? He's got to have his radio or he can't come in. Jake took a seat from the desk and sat up. What do you mean? something's wrong with his radio. One he said he's calling for his landing instructions, but they can't get anything back to him. He's just reached Brinch-Shalush and he's in free fall now. There'll be four days before he gets here. That's the way they work it. He's supposed to get in touch with his space port. He wants to land at and I know how they work it. Jake growled. See if there's anything on the last news wire from Bluna about him. Phil Mooney flicked his set on again and repeated carefully. Calling on the onto space port. Phil Mooney outbound Luna calling on the onto space port. Come in on the onto. Calling Phil Mooney calling Phil Mooney. Only onto space port calling Phil Mooney. Come in Mooney. He cast a quick glance back at the child, strapped carefully in the middle bunk. She was unconscious now, possibly as a result of the acceleration in leaving Luna. He had to reach a speed of approximately two miles per second to escape Earth satellite, and that had called for more G's acceleration than Lily and sick body could bear. His lips thinned back over his teeth. It would be even worse when they came in for landing and he'd have to break against Earth gravity. He switched on the set again to give it another try. Instructions were to contact the space port at which you plan to land as soon as possible. There was plenty of time, of course, but the sooner the better. He said. Calling on the onto space port. This is Phil Mooney. Luna calling on the onto. Come in on the onto. Calling Phil Mooney calling Phil Mooney on the onto space port. Calling Phil Mooney come in Mooney. Ed Kerry came back to the city room with a sheet of yellow paper that he turned off the radio type. He said. You're to his Jake. This kid, her name is Lily and Marshall. Is the only survivor of an explosion at that nuclear efficient laboratory they had on the dark side. A roll man and her mother were working under this professor deems both of them killed. His eyes went on scanning the story. Evidently this Phil Mooney runs an unscheduled space liner. Anyway he blasted off to rush the kid to an earth hospital. Jake took the dispatch and scald at it. Barry, he growned. See what we got on this Phil Mooney in the morgue. He rubbed the end of his nose, thoughtfully. They'll probably pick him up all right when he gets nearer. Somebody on rewrite said. He doesn't make any difference how far he is. They should be able to reach him even if he was halfway to morgue. Something's wrong with his set. He decided to try one of the other space ports. As a matter of fact it made very little difference at which of them he landed. There'd be suitable hospital facilities within reasonable distance of any space port. He was three days out now and according to spaceways custom, had to let them know he was coming in. It wasn't like landing a airplane. They won plenty of time to prepare for a space craft survival. He said calling new Albuquerque space port, calling new Albuquerque space port, Phil Mooney Luna calling new Albuquerque please come in new Albuquerque. Calling Phil Mooney calling Phil Mooney, new Albuquerque space port calling Phil Mooney. We are receiving you perfectly come in Mooney. You tried once more calling new Albuquerque space port calling new Albuquerque space port. Please come in new Albuquerque emergency repeat emergency please come in new Albuquerque. Calling Phil Mooney calling Phil Mooney, we are receiving you perfectly Mooney come in Mooney. Kitty killed air took up her notes and prepared to make her way back to her own tiny office. I've got a Jake, she said breathlessly. Kitty was always breathless over any story, carrying more pathos that a basketball score. My columnant tomorrow have them melting. Actually I mean. Jake shuttered inwardly after she left. Ed Kerry came up and drooped on the edge of the desk. Here's the dope on this Phil Mooney Jake. He said he's about 30 was in the last war and saw action when we had our space forces storming new petrograd. Did some fighting around the satellites too. Piled a kid a one-seater got a couple of metals but never really made big news. Got any picks of him? Ed Kelly shook his head. Like I said he never really made the big news. One more of these young fellows that saw plenty of action and when the war was over was too keyed up to settle down to everyday life. Jake picked up the thin folder and rifled through the few clippings there. What's he doing now? He growled. Evidently when the war ended he got one of the surplus freighters and converted it. Name of his company is Mooney Space Service. Sounds impressive but he's the only one in it. Will be going broke most of these guys are. Can't make the grade against the competition of terror-loonous spaceways and the other big boys with the schedule flights. The city editor scratched the end of his nose speculatively. Maybe we ought to have Jim do up an editorial on these unscheduled space lines. Something along the line of how heroic some of these guys are. That's sort of stuff. To up the idea they're always ready, fair weather or fall to make an emergency trip. Kerry said, there isn't any weather, fair or fall in space. Jake scalded him. You know what I mean wise guy. Meanwhile, get some statements from some authorities. Ed Kerry said painfully, what statements from what authorities? The city editor glared at him. So help me, Ed, I'm going to stick you on obituaries. Any statements from any authorities. You know damn well what I mean. Get some doctor to beef about the fact there aren't suitable hospitalization facilities on Luna. Get some president of one of the unscheduled space lines sound off about what a hero Mooney is and how much good these unscheduled space lines are. And that reminds me of something. The old to a tall, lanky reporter at the fore into the city room. Hey Ted, get bunny on the line up in O'Neontan and tell her I set the look up some of these unscheduled space lines guys and see if she could get a photograph of Phil Mooney from them. Maybe he's got some buddies in O'Neontan. There was one thing about being in free fall. You had lots of time to sit and think. Too much time perhaps. You had time to think at all over and over and over again. There was the war which had torn you from the routine into which life had settled from friends and relations as we harts and thrown you into a one man space fighter in which you sometimes stayed for weeks on end without communication with anyone friend or foe. There had probably been no equivalent situation of the history of past warfare to the one man space scouts. The nearest thing to them might have been the flyers of 1914 and the first world war. But of course they were up there alone only for hours at a time not weeks. You developed self-beliance men was the way the Colonel had put it. You developed self-beliance or your son. You're in space by yourself alone. You can't use your radio or they can locate you. If something happens some emergency or some contact with the enemy you're on your own. You have to figure it out. There's no superior officer to do your thinking. You're the whole works. And the Colonel had been right of course. It was a matter of using your own whits your own ability. Fighting at a space scout was the work of an individual, not of a team. Perhaps it would be different someday in the future when machines and instruments had been developed further. But now it was an individualist to game each man for himself. And probably it was because of this training that he, Phil Muni, was unable to get back into the crowd after the war had ended. He was an individualist who rebelled against working not only for, but even with someone else. He should have known better. Industry had reached beyond the point where one man goes out by himself and makes a fortune or even a living he thought, Riley. It's the day of the big concerns of tremendous trusts and cartels who didn't even have to bother with the task of squeezing out tiny competitors like himself. He was out before he started. The Muni space service, he snorted himself depreciation. Oh, well. He pulled himself erect and made his way to the bunk. The kid was awake. He grinned down at her and said, I was going, Lillian. Horizon seemed glazed, even worse than they'd been yesterday, but she tried to smile back at him. All right, she whispered, her child's voice so low he could hardly make it out. Where's Mother? Phil Muni held a finger to his lips. Maybe you'd better not talk to him, Marce Lillian. Your mother and father are, they're all right. The thing right now is to get you to the hospital and make you well again. Understand? Kitty killed air was saying indignantly. What's this about knowing sure and son Luna? Use your head, Kitty. Jake grunted. What company'd be crazy enough to ensure anybody working on Luna? By the way, that was a good piece on Muni and the Marce Lillian. Did you read it? Kitty killed air was pleased. He shuddered. Well, no, but the letter has been pouring in. Maybe you want to do another. Take it from some other angle this time. That's why I wanted you to know about the insurance. Do you realize that this child, this poor sick defenseless child, is penniless? Actually, I mean, bad enough that her parents helped after an orphan, but Jake, that child is penniless. Oh, right. All right. He told her. Work on that for tomorrow's column. Ed came up with another radio type report just as Kitty was leaving. This guy's Muni is calling all the other spaceports now, Jake. Never done he is getting desperate. He's only two days out. And by the way, here's a new angle. This guy Harry Marshall, the kid's father, was a wartime buddy of Phil Muni. They went to cadetschool or something together. Jake grout thoughtfully. He hasn't got a chance. But it makes a tremendous story. We get somebody to rip up a set in the radio type room, and we'll see if we can listen in. There was a desperate tense, taught, inflection in his voice now. Calling new Albuquerque Spaceport or on the onto spaceport, Phil Muni calling any Earth Spaceport, Phil Muni calling on the onto new Albuquerque Casa Blanca, Mookton, any Earth Spaceport, emergency, emergency, request landing instructions. Have Lily and Marshall eight years old needing immediate medical care aboard. Please come in any Earth Spaceport. Calling Phil Muni, new Albuquerque calling Phil Muni, ambulance waiting on grounds, receiving you perfectly come in. Calling Phil Muni, Casa Blanca Spaceport calling Phil. Calling Phil Muni. On the onto spaceport calling Phil Muni. Ed Kerry looked up over the set in the radio type room at the city editor. He went his lips carefully and said, he's only got one day now. They've got to pick him up in hours or he's sunk. Jake said, I never did understand how that works. Why can't he land himself? I know he can't, but why? The reporter shrugged. I don't quite get it either, but evidently the whole operation is pretty delicate stuff. They bring him down with radar, somehow or other. It's not like landing an airplane. Landing a spacecraft is done from the ground up not from the spacecraft down. The pilot has comparatively little to do about it. At least that's the way it is with nine ships out of ten. The set began to Blair again and they both listened tensely. It was Phil Muni. Listen you guys down there. If you're sitting around playing craps or something on going to have a few next break when I get down. The two newspaperman stared at each other over the set. Ed Kerry ran his tongue over his lips again. The strange tone had gone from the voice of the space pilot now and had been replaced by one of hopelessness. He said, I don't know who I think I'm kidding. I know darn well there, something wrong with my receiver. And I can't find out what it is. Maybe the sender is off to for all I know. All I can pick up is some girl singing something about white roses. White roses yet. I want landing instructions that I get white roses. Ed Kerry jerked his head up and snapped. Holy jump being hell. He's able to pick some commercial station. Jake came to his feet, stuck his neck out of the door and yelled at the top of his voice. Phil Muni is receiving some commercial station. Some aim, singing something about white roses. Check out the station in the city. Find out if any of them are broadcasting some damn singing about white roses. Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program for an emergency situation. Undoubtedly, you have heard on your newscasts and have read in your papers of the tragic case of Lily and Marshall, Child Victim of an atomic explosion on Luna, which often her and necessitated her immediate flight to an earth hospital. For the past three days, the spacecraft carrying her, piloted by War Hero Philip Muni, has been having trouble with this radio. Due to circumstances surrounding landing of spacecraft, the two have been given up as lost in spite of the fact that almost hourly it has been possible to receive messages from Muni. It is now revealed that he is able to pick up this program on the interplanetary broadcasting system network. We are not sure which of the nearly 2000 stations of our system he is receiving, but we will now attempt to reach Phil Muni with relayed messages from the Onyanta space port where expert medical care is awaiting little Lily and Marshall. Come in onyanta. Calling Phil Muni, calling Phil Muni, come in Phil. This is onyanta space port relaying through the interplanetary broadcasting system, come in Phil. Come in onyanta. Over. Okay Phil. Now this is it. We should have had you two hours ago, but we will make out all right. Your velocity is a little too high. Give us six more units on your Kingston valves. Get that over. Got it. Six more units on the Kingston's over. All right. Switch on your remote control fill. We'll take it from here. And by the coordinators, it was night, but a blaze of lights illuminated the Onyanta space port. Hundreds of landcars stood on the parking lots, thousands of persons crowded the wire fence which kept all but port personnel from the field itself. The old space freighter sank easily to the apron and in seconds the rocket flames died. A surge of humanity ebbed over the field toward the craft. Phil Mooney opened the pilot compartment's hatch and stuck his head out, blinking and surprise at the mob beneath him. I don't know what this is all about. He began, but I've got a sick kid aboard. There's supposed to be an ambulance. Police wedged through the crowd, conveying a right-haired white jacketed man. He called up to the space pilot. We won't need an ambulance, Mr. Mooney. I've already made arrangements for facilities here at the airport for immediate treatment. Phil Mooney made his way to the ground and scowled, still obviously startled by the swelling crowd. Who in, curter you, he asked. The other motion for two assistants to enter this ship and bring out the child. I'm Dr. Kern. He said, I'll see Dr. Adrian Kern, the radiation expert, the pilot frown, wordly. See, here, Dr. The Marshalls were friends of mine and I've taken over the care of little lillian, but I'm, well, I'm afraid I couldn't afford to pay you. I mean, the famous Dr. Smout to him. I've been retained by the interplanetary gold and heart, Phil. You need to worry about my fee. Besides, he smiled easily. I'm not going to accept any fee for this case. You see, I was listening to Marshall Malloy singing love of white roses when your call came through. I believe it was the most poignant experience I have ever been through a girl next to the Dr. Gushed. I'm Bunny Davis, Mr. Mooney, the managing editor of our newspaper chain has authorized me to buy your story for 5,000 if you'll just feel mooney, blinked. I, I, a heavy set man in a business suit grasp his hand and chuck it with fervor while flash bulbs went off blindingly. Phil, he set huskily as though moved by deep emotion as president of the board of directors of Tertral Luna Spaceways. I wish to take this opportunity to offer you a full, hey, give us a smile, Phil. I man on top of a television truck yelled. He was headed back for Luna the next day. They'd been in dignity, of course. There was Hollywood and the television networks and that Tertral Luna Spaceways guy who wanted to get in on all the publicity by offering him a vice presidency and the newspaper editors and the magazine editors and all the rest of them. Approximately a billion persons had been tuned in to the interplanetary network when the emergency landing instructions had been broadcast to him through that system. A billion persons had set on the edge of their chairs, tensely, as his ship had been brought in. He and Little Lillian had received more publicity in the past 24 hours than anyone since Lindbergg. And the child would be all right now, before he left, checks totaling over a quarter of a million had come in for her. All nations from all over the earth and from Mars and Venus and even some from the Jupiter satellites. And offers up an option. Thousands of them from rich and poor, even including Marsha Mallory, the video starhood been singing that song, Love of White Roses. Yes, Lillian would be all right. He wouldn't have been able to pay for the medical care she'd needed, but now she had the most capable experts on earth at her disposal. They had been indignant when he blasted off again for Luna, they wanted to make a hero of him. This leaving on his port they interpreted as modesty, which come to think of it would make him all the more of a hero. Phil Munney slipped the hand down to his set and flicked it on. He dialed over a dozen different stations. The news programs were all full of him and of Lillian. You think to hear them that he was the noblest, the most daring, the greatest man since Alexander the Great, he grinned, Riley. One of the reasons he'd been so anxious to leave was to get away before somebody thought the check his set to see what was wrong with it. Why, if anybody had found that it was actually in perfect shape, they probably have lynched him. Yeah, the Colonel had been right. In the space forces, you learn to be self-reliant. When you got in a bad spot, you figured it out yourself. You're on your own. It's you against everything and everybody. Anything goes. His grin broadened. Maybe he wasn't a hero, the way they were all painting him, but at least Lillian was all right now, and no longer pinneless the way her parents' death had left her. And he wasn't doing so badly himself.

Short Ghost and Horror Collection 053,Various,48628,3.0,"June 18, 2021",[],0,"x.org. Recording by Clif Stone or Sydney or Australia. The Alchemist by HP Lovecraft. High up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are wooded near the base with the nile trees of the primeval forest, stands the old shadow of my ancestors. For centuries, its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about, serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honoured line is older than even the mosque-grown castle walls. These ancient turrets, stained by the storms of generations and crumbling under the slow yet mighty pressure of time, formed in the ages of feudalism, one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all France. From its matriculated parapots and mounted battlements, barons, counts and even kings had been defied, yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the footsteps of the invader. But since those glorious years all is changed. A poverty but little above the level of dire want, together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life, have prevented the sions of our line from maintaining their estates and pristine splendor. In the falling stones of the walls, the overgrown vegetation in the parks, the dry and dusty moat, the ill paved courtyards, and toppling towers without, as well as the sagging floors, the worm-edan-wane scots and the faded tapestries within, all teleglumy tale of fallen grand-you-er. As the ages passed, first one, then another of the four great turrets were left and till it last but a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estate. It was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that I, Antoine, last of the unhappy and accursed contests to see, first saw the light of day, ninety long years ago. Within these walls, and amongst the dark and shadowy forests, the wild ravines and gruttos of their hillside below, were spent the first years of my troubled life. My parents, I never knew. My father had been killed at the age of 32, a month before I was born, by the fall of a stone somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapids of the castle. And my mother, having died at my birth, my care and education devolves solely upon one remaining servitor, an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence, whose name I remember as Pierre. I was an only child, and the lack of companionship, which this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the strange care, exercised by my aged guardian, in excluding me from the society of the peasants children, whose abodes were scattered here and there upon the plains at surround the base of the hill. At the time, Pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble birth placed me above association with such plebian company. Now, I know that its real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line. That were nightly told and magnified by the simple tenetary as they conversed and hushed accents in the glow of their cottageards. Thus isolated and thrown upon my own resources, I spent the hours of my childhood, impouring over the ancient tomes that filled the shadow-haunted library of the shadow, and enroaming without aim or purpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clodes the side of the hill near its foot. It was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy. Those studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in nature most strongly claimed my attention. Of my own race, I was permitted to learn singularly little, yet what small knowledge of it I was able to gain seemed to depress me much. Perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my all-perceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which I felt at the mention of my great house. Yet as I grew out of childhood, I was able to piece together disconnected fragments of discourse, let slip from the unwilling tongue which had begun to falter in approaching sonility, that had a sort of relation to assert and circumstance which I had always deemed strange, but which now became dimly terrible. The circumstance to which I allude is the early age at which all the compties of my line had met their end. Whilst I had had the two considered this but a natural attribute of a family of short-lived men, I afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of 32 years. Upon my 21st birthday, the aged Pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for many generations been handed down from father to son and continued by each possessor. Its contents were of the most startling nature and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions. At this time, my belief in the supernatural was firm and deep seated, else I should have dismissed with scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyes. The paper carried me back to the days of the 13th century when the old castle in which I said had been a feared and impregnable fortress. It told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelt on our estates, a person of no small accomplishments though little above the rank of peasant. By name, Michelle, usually designated by the surname of Mouvet, the evil on account of his sinister reputation. He had studied beyond the custom of his kind, seeking such sins as the philosopher's stone or the elixir of eternal life and was reputed wise in the terrible secrets of black magic and alchemy. Michelle Mouvet had one son named Charles, a youth as proficient as himself in the head and nuts, and who had therefore been called less or c.a. all the wizard. This pair shunned by all honest folk who were suspected of the most hideous practices. Old Michelle was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the devil, and the unaccountable disappearances of many small peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these two. Yet through the dark natures of the father and the son, ran one redeeming ray of humanity. The evil old man loved his offspring with fear and intensity, whilst the youth had for his parent a more than filial affection. One night, the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the vanishment of young god-free, son to Henry the Compty. A searching party headed by the frantic father invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there came upon old Michelle Mouvet busy over a huge and violently boiling cauldron. Without certain cause, in the ungoverned madness of fury and despair, the Compty laid hands on the aged wizard, and there he released his murderous hold, his victim was no more. Meanwhile, joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young god-free in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice, telling too late that poor Michelle had been killed in vain. As the Compty and his associates turned away from the lollier boat of the alchemists, the form of Charles LaSourcia appeared through the trees, the excited chatter of the menial standing about told him what had occurred. Yet he seemed at first unmoved at his father's fate. Then, slowly advancing to meet the Compty, he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of sea. May near a noble of thy murderous line survive to reach a greater age than dying. Spake he, when suddenly, leaping backwards into the blackwood he drew from his tunic a file of colorless liquid which he threw into the face of his father's slayer as he disappeared behind the Inky curtain of the night. The Compty died without utterance, and was buried the next day but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth. No trace of the assassin could be found though relentless bands of peasants scoured the neighboring woods and the middle land around the hill. Thus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse and the minds of the late Compty's family, so that when Godfrey, innocent cause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title was killed by an arrow whilst hunting at the age of 32, there were no thoughts save those of grief at his demise. But when years after it, the next young Compty, Robert by name, was found dead in an nearby field from no apparent cause, the peasants told in whispers that this in your head but lately passed his 30 second birth date when surprised by early death. Lewis, son to Robert, was found drowned in the mode at the same fate for age and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle. Henris, Roberts, Antoine's and Amarn's, snatched from happy and virtuous lives, went little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder. That I had left at most by eleven years of further existence was made certain to me by the words which I read. My life previously held at small value now became giver to me each day as I delve deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic. I salated as I was, modern science had produced no impression upon me, and I labored as in the middle ages, as raptors had been old Michelle and young Charles themselves and the acquisition of demonological and alchemical learning. Yet readers I might, in no manner could I count for the strange curse upon my line. In unusually rational moments I would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation attributing the early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister Charles LaSourceia and his ears. It having found upon Keffel and Quarry that there were no no indescendants of the alchemist, I would fall back to occult studies, and once more, endeavour to find a spell that would release my house from its terrible burden. Upon one thing I was absolutely resolved, I should never wed, for since no other branches of my family were in existence, I might thus end the curse with myself. As I drew near the age of thirty, old Pierre was called to the land beyond. Alone I buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wonder in life. Thus was I left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress. And in my utter solitude, my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met. Much of my time was now occupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old Shateau, which in youth, Pierre had caused me to shun, and some of which, Alpier had once told me had not been trotting by human foot for over four centuries. Strange and awesome were many of the objects I encountered. Furniture covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness met my eyes. Cobwebs in a profusion never before seen by me were spun everywhere, a huge bats, flapped their boony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloom. Of my exact age, even down today's and hours I kept the most careful record for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much more of my doomed existence. At length I approached that time which I had so long viewed with apprehension. Since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they reached the exact age of come to Henry at his end, I was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death. In what strange form the curse should overtake me I knew not, but I was resolved at least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim. With new vigor I applied myself to my examination of the old Chetot and its contents. It was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the deserted portion of the castle, less than a week before that fatal hour which I felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth. Beyond which I could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw breath. That I came upon the culminating of the event of my whole life. I had spent the better part of the morning, and climbing up and down half ruin staircases and one of the most delapidated of the ancient turrets. As the afternoon progressed I sought the lower levels, descending into what appeared to be either a medieval place of confinement or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder. As I slowly traversed the nighter and crusted passageway at the foot of the last staircase the paving became very damp and soon I saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank water stained wall impeded my journey. Turning to retrace my steps my eye fell upon a small trap door with a ring which laid directly beneath my feet. Pauzing I succeeded with difficulty in raising it where upon there was revealed a black aperture, exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps. As soon as the torch which I lowered into the repellent depths burned freely and steadily I commenced my descent. The steps were many and led to a narrow stone flagged passage which I knew must be far underground. Depassage proved of great length and terminated in a massive oakenedoar dripping with the moisture of the place and stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it. Seizing after a time my efforts in this direction I had proceeded back some distance towards the steps when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind. Without warning I heard the heavy door behind me creaks slowly open upon its rusted hinges. My immediate sensations are incapable of analysis to be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as I had deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit. Produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description. When at last I turned and faced the seat of the sound my eyes must have started from their orbits at the sight of what they be held. There in the ancient Gothic doorway stood a human figure. It was that of a man clad in a skull cap and long medieval tunic of dark colour. His long hair and flowing beard were overterable and intense black hue and of incredible profusion. His forehead high beyond the usual dimensions, his cheeks deep sunken and heavily lined with wrinkles and his hands long claw like a nod where of such a deadly marble like whiteness as I have never elsewhere seen in man. His figure lean to the proportions of a skeleton was strangely bent and almost lost within the volume as folds of his peculiar gamut. But strangest of all with his eyes. Twin caves of a visible blackness profound and expression of understanding yet inhuman indigreary of wickedness. These were now fixed upon me piercing my soul with their hatred and rooting me to the spot where I stood. At last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull, holeness and latent malevolence. The language in which the discourse was clothed was that the based form of Latin and use amongst the more learned men of the Middle Ages and made familiar to me by my prolonged researchers into the works of the old alchemists and demonologists. The apparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over my house, told me of my coming end dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old Michelle Mulvey and gluted over the revenge of Charles LaSourcee. He told how the young Charles had escaped into the night, returning in after years to kill God for you the air with an arrow just as he approached the age which had been his father's at his assassination. How he had secretly returned to the estate and established himself unknown in the even then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous narrator. How he had seized Robert, son of God for he in a field, forced poison down his throat and left him to die at the age of 32. Thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse. At this point I was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all. How the curse had been fulfilled since that time when Charles LaSourcee must in the course of nature have died. For the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards, father and son, speaking most particularly of the researchers of Charles LaSourcee, concerning the Alyxa, which should grant to him who partock of it, eternal life and youth. His enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terror relies the hatred that had had at first so haunted them. But suddenly the fiendish glare returned, and with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent, the stranger raised the glass file with the evidence intent of ending my life as had Charles LaSourcee as 600 years before ended that of my ancestor. Prompted by some preserving instinct of self-defense, I broke through the spell that had hitherto held me immovable and flung my now dying torch at the creature who minest my existence. I heard the file break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrored scene with a ghastly radiance. The shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the would be a sass improved too much for my already shaken nerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint. When it last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark and my mind remembering what had occurred shrank from the idea of beholding more. Yet curiosity overmastered all. Who I asked myself was this man of evil and how came he within the castle walls? Why should he seek to avenge to death the poor Michelle Mouvet, and how had the curse been carried on through all the long centuries since the time of Charles LaSourceee? The dread of years was lifted from my shoulders for I knew that he whom I had felt was the source of all my danger from the curse. And now that I was free I burned with the desire to learn more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries and made of my own youth one long continued nightmare. Determined upon further exploration I felt in my pockets for flint and steel and lit the unused torch which I had with me. First of all the new light revealed the distorted and black and form of the mysterious stranger. The hideous eyes were now closed, disliking the sight I turned away and entered the chamber beyond the Gothic door. Here I found what seemed much like an alchemist laboratory. In one corner was an immense pile of shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch. It may have been gold but I did not pause to examine it for I was strangely affected by that which I had undergone. At the farther end of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines of the dark hillside forest. Filled with wonder yet now realizing how the man had obtained access to the shadow I proceeded to return. I had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face but as I approached the body I seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound as though life were not yet wholly extinct. A gust I turned to examine the child and shriveled figure on the floor. Then all at once the horrible eyes blacker even then the seared face in which they were set open wide with an expression which I was unable to interpret. The cracked lips tried to frame words which I could not well understand. Once I caught the name of Charles the Sourceier and again I fancy that the words years and curse issued from the twisted mouth. Still I was at a loss together the purport of his disconnected speech. At my evident ignorance of his meaning the Pitchy eyes once more fleshed malevolently at me until helpless as I saw my opponent to be I trembled as I watched him. Suddenly the wretch animated with his last burst of strength raised as hideous head from the dampened sunken pavement. Then as I remained paralyzed with fear he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed fourth those words which have ever afterwards haunted my days and my nights. Full heat shriek can you not guess my secret have you no brain whereby you may recognise the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon your house? Have I not told you of the great elixir of eternal life? No you not how the secret of alchemy was solved? I tell you it is I. I. I that have lived for 600 years to maintain my revenge for I am Charles Les Sorsier.

For my companion had been eating his breakfast with his attention entirely centered upon the paper, which was propped up by the coffee pot. Now I looked across at him to find his eyes fastened upon me, with the half-amused half-questioning expression, which he usually assumed, when he felt he had made an intellectual point. Do what I asked? He smiled as he took his slipper from the mantelpiece and drew from it enough shag tobacco to fill the old clay pipe with which he invariably rounded off his breakfast. A most characteristic question of yours, Watson. Said he, you'll not, I am sure, be offended. If I say that any reputation for sharpness which I may possess has been entirely gained by the admirable foil which you have made for me. Have I not heard of debutants who have insisted upon plainness in their shaperones? There is a certain analogy. Our long companionship in the Baker Street rooms had left us on those easy terms of intimacy, when much maybe said without a fence, and yet I acknowledged that I was nettle at his remark. I may be very obtuse, said I, but I confess that I am unable to see how you have managed to know that I was, I was asked to help in the Edinburgh University Pazard. Precisely, the letter has only just come to hand, and I have not spoken to you since. In spite of that, said Holmes, leaning back in his chair, and putting his fingertips together. I would even venture to suggest that the object of the Pazard is to enlarge the University Cricket field. I looked at him in such bewilderment that he vibrated with silent laughter. The fact is, my dear Watson, that you are an excellent subject. Said he, you are never Blase, you respond instantly to any external stimulus. Your mental process is maybe slow, but they are never obscure, and I found during breakfast that you are easier reading than the leader in the times in front of me. I should be glad to know how you arrived at your conclusions, said I. I fear that my good nature in giving explanations has seriously compromised my reputation. Said Holmes, but in this case, the train of reasoning is based upon such obvious facts that no credit can be claimed for it. You entered the room with a thoughtful expression. The expression of a man who is debating some point in his mind. In your hand, you held a solitary letter. Now, last night you retired in the best of spirits, so it was clear that it was this letter in your hand, which it caused the change in you. This is obvious. It is all obvious when it is explained to you. I naturally asked myself, what the letter could contain, which might have this effect upon you. As you walked, you held the flap side of the envelope towards me, and I saw upon it the same shield shaped device which I have observed upon your old college cricket cap. It was clear that that the request came from Edinburgh University, or from some club connected with the University. When you reached the table, you laid down the letter beside your plate with the address up a most, and you walked over to look at the framed photograph upon the left of the mantelpiece. It amazed me to see the accuracy with which he had observed in my movements. What next I asked? I began by glancing at the address, and I could tell even at the distance of six feet that it was an unofficial communication. This I gathered from the use of the word doctor upon the address, to which as a Bachelor of Medicine you have no legal claim. I knew that university officials are pedantic in their correct use of titles, and I was thus enabled to say with certainty that your letter was unofficial. When, on your return to the table you turned over your letter and allowed me to perceive that the enclosure was a printed one, the idea of a bizarre first occurred to me. I had already weighed the possibility of it being a political communication, but this seemed improbable in the present stagnant conditions of politics. When you returned to the table your face still retained its expression, and it was evident that your examination of the photograph had not changed the current of your thoughts. In that case, it must itself bear upon the subject in question. I turned my attention to the photograph therefore, and saw at once that it consisted of yourself as a member of the Edinburgh University 11, with the Pavilion and Cricket Field in the background. My small experience of cricket clubs, as taught me that next to churches and cavalry enzymes, they are the most debt-laden things upon Earth. When upon your return to the table I saw you take out your pencil and draw lines upon the envelope, I was convinced that you were endeavouring to realise some projected improvement which was to be brought about by a bizarre. Your face still showed some indecision so that I was able to break in upon you as my advice that you should assist in so good and object. I could not help smiling at the extreme simplicity of his explanation. Of course, it was as easy as possible, said I. My remark appeared to nettle him. I may add, said he. That's a particular help which you have been asked to give, was that you should write in their album, and that you have already made up your mind that the present incident will be the subject of your article. But how I cried? It is as easy as possible, said he. And I leave its solution to your own ingenuity. In the meantime, he added, raising his paper. You will excuse me if I return to this very interesting article upon the trees of Krimona, and the exact reasons for the pre-eminence in the manufacture of violins. It is one of those small outlying problems to which I am sometimes tempted to direct my attention. And of chat to one.","Dramatic Readings, Detective Fiction, Short Stories",English,01:39:10,LibriVox Volunteers,[],"['Peter Yeasley', 'Stevens', 'Blase', 'Michelle Eaton', 'John', 'Algae Pug', 'Potter Hood', 'Charles Connover', 'James', 'Brent Burgess', 'David Perty', 'Pazard', 'James McPherson', 'Librevox', 'Alan Mapsstone', 'Larry Wilson', 'Louis West', 'Marvin Bonarescer', 'Thomas Peter', 'Noel Vox.', 'John McCoy', 'Collins', 'James Blant', 'John Palmer', 'Dr Watson', 'Adrian Stevens', 'James Karrin', 'Watson', 'Rob Molland', 'Lauren Emma', 'Holmes', 'Said Holmes', 'Krimona']","['Newton', 'yours', 'Earlston']",['Earth'],0,0,0,0,22,1,1
The Reformation Collection Volume 3,Various,54754,3.0,"September 30, 2021",[],0,"r to volunteer, please visit librevox.org. The Books of the Old Testament teach us that the God, a doored by Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Sarah, David, and our other fathers is the only true God, all powerful and eternal, who are the infinite goodness which is in him created by his eternal word, the heavens, and the earth and all that is in them. From whom all things proceed without whom nothing exists, who executes justice and mercy and all other things entirely as the same as him good, and suffers not that anyone presumptuously ask why that which he has done is thus or thus. Beyond this, these books give us to understand that the very high and the all-powerful God after he had created all things formed Adam the first man, and that in his own image and likeness, appointing and establishing him Lord over all creatures of the earth, which Adam, through the hatred and deceit of the devil fell into disobedience, doing and striving in opposition to the commandment of his creator, and by his sin so brought into the world the infection and poison of sin, that all we who descend from him are from our birth, deserving of the wrath and punishment of God, partakers of death and damnation, enslaved under the power and tyranny of the devil. We learn also in these very excellent books that of old God promised to Adam Abraham, Isaac, Sarah, David, and others of those of all time that he would send the blessed seed his son Jesus Christ, our Savior, who should deliver from sin and from the tyranny and slavery of the devil, those who with a living and fruit-producing faith should believe that promise and should trust in Jesus Christ, expecting the promised deliverance and liberty of him and by him alone. Also, they show us and cause us to understand that notwithstanding that the old is relight as fathers waited for the promised salvation and deliverance. Yet man is of a nature so naughty and corrupted that of his own will he does not acknowledge himself as sinner, such as his concern in the promised Savior. God the Creator gave by Moses his law written on two tables of stone, that by it, men might learn how great is the depravity and malice of the human heart, to the end that they might therefore more ardently desire the coming of Jesus Christ, who was to redeem them and deliver them from sin. Which could not be done by the law, nor by the victims and sacrifices of the law, which only served to represent and to provide the real offering that Jesus Christ would make of his own body by which ablation all sins should be blotted out and abolished. The books of the New Testament inform us that the great king and promised Messiah Jesus Christ, who is very guard worthy of praise over all forever, to provide and represented in the books of the Old Testament, was at last sinned from his father in the time that the father had ordained and settled in himself, that is to say when iniquity and abomination abounded in the world. The Savior Jesus Christ was thus sent and took upon him human flesh and suffered death and returned to life, not on account of good works that anyone had done for all were sinners, but in order that God our father, whose word is truth, might give us the great riches of his grace, which he had promised and might save us by his mercy. It is then clearly shown to us in the New Testament that Jesus Christ, the real Lamb and the true victim, wiping away the sins of men, came into the world to make peace between his father and us, and to restore us to his favor and love, cleansing us from our sins by his blood to the end that he might deliver us from the slavery of the devil by whom we were made captives and slaves whenever we felt into sin. And might adopt us and make us children of God to be fellow ears with himself as so beautiful and so noble a kingdom. But to the end that we may know this singular and excellent benefit which God has done for us, he gives us his holy spirit, the fruit and effect of which is to make us believe in God and in the king and Messiah whom he has sent. For certainly without the operation of the Holy Spirit, by which we are taught and as with a seal of fixed to them are made certain and sure of, the things which we believe we cannot believe that God sent the Messiah into the world, nor that Jesus Christ is that Messiah. For our sin pauses, no one can confess that Jesus is God and Lord, having power to save, unless it be by the mighty inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This same spirit is the witness to our spirit and makes it believe that we are children of God and fills us with that great charity and love which sent Paul describes to their Corinthians. Besides faith and charity, this same spirit gives us the vigor of hope which is a certain looking forward to the life eternal and indestructible of which life it becomes our pledge like a good security in a matter of loan. It gives us also other favors and spiritual gifts of which sent Paul writes to the Galatians. He must not deem the fruits of faith to be trifling or of slight efficacy, for by trust and faith in Jesus Christ, which shows itself in works of love and constrains man to do them. We are made just and holy that is to say, God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is also our Father, because of the adoption of us by Jesus Christ our brother, as steams us just and holy, purely of his favor and goodness through the merit and satisfaction of his son Jesus Christ. He is seeking no reckoning of our sins and not accounting them to us as sins and not condemning us to eternal death and misery because of them. Lastly Jesus Christ came into this world in order that after we are purged from our sins and made holy by faith in him, we should take from him an example of well doing, following his will in doing good works and renouncing all carnal works and of a free will serving him in living justly and holy all the days of our life. That through good works which before our calling God have made ready and prepared to be done by us, we should show that we are called to that favor and gift of faith. And whoever does not these good works shows that he has not that faith in Jesus Christ, which he requires of us. To this Savior we must come out and go and with great boldness follow him that he may instruct us. Or he is our master, tender and lowly of heart, our example and model from whom we must take pattern how to live. Still further he is the bishop and shepherd of our souls, the great priest and offering makeer who himself offered his own blood for us, the mediator and atonement between God and us men, who is now set down at the right hand of God his father, being our advocate and intercessor praying for us, who will undoubtedly obtain from the father that which we ask of him, or of his father in his name, provided that in asking we firmly believe it will be so because he has promised it. Through him when we have sinned let us not fear with true repentance to which Jesus Christ invites and urges us from the very beginning of his preaching and with firm and lively faith to go to the throne and royal seat where he ever sits, not to exercise vengeance but to show favor to those who ask it and he will be merciful for he came into the world that by his grace he might save sinners. Jesus Christ, verily, will come after the time settled by his own father and will sit upon his throne with great majesty and will judge all men and will render to everyone according to his deeds, whether good or evil and will say to those on his right hand, who in this world looked forward to good things to come, that is to life eternal, come you who are chosen of my father to life eternal, to take possession of the kingdom which is prepared for you and assign to you from before the creation of the world and on the contrary to those on his left hand he will say depart from me, ye cursed and reprobate creatures into the eternal fire which is prepared and made ready for the devil and his angels. Then to a certainty will be the end of the world when Jesus Christ after having triumphed over all his enemies shall give up and restore to God his father the kingdom which now he holds of him. In order that we might learn all this which is here set forth for goodness of God has willed that through his holy spirit the books of the Bible should be given to us in writing and has ordained the preaching of the doctrine contained in them. He has also given us his sacraments by which the truth of this same doctrine is as it were sealed. That we might know and believe that there is but one true God and one soul Jesus Christ whom he has sent as he promised and that in believing we might have eternal life through the same Jesus Christ. Another foundation in this can no man lay in the church of Christ upon it she is based so that simple desire that whoever should proclaim any other faith and salvation than that through Jesus Christ even though he were an angel from heaven might be lost cast out and rejected of God. To God the Father then of whom and by whom and to whom are all things and to Jesus Christ our Lord who redeem the world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit be honour and glory eternally. Amen.

The Abel McClocklands by Margaret Wilson. Section 1. The Prairie lay that afternoon as it had lane for centuries of September afternoons, vast as an ocean. Motionless as an ocean, coaxed into very little ripples by language breezes. Silence as an ocean were only very little waves slip back into their element. One might have walked for hours, without hearing anything louder, then high white clouds casting shadows over the distances, or the tall, slow grass bending lazily into waves. One might have gone on, startled only by the falling of scarlet, swamp-lyly seeds, by sudden goldfinches, or the scratching of young prairie chickens in the shorter grasses. For years now, not even a baby buffalo had called to its mother in those stretches, or an old squab, broken ripening wild grapes from the creek thicket. 15 years ago, one might have gone west for months, without hearing a human voice. Even that day, a traveler might easily have missed the house, where little David and the fatter little Sarah sat playing, for it was less than the vastness about it than one short bubble in a wave's crest. 10 years ago, the children's father had halted his ox team there, finishing his journey from airshire, and his eight boys and girls alighting upon the summer's crop of wild strawberries had harvested it with shrieks of delight, which broke forever, the immediate part of the centuries silence. A solitary man would have left the last source of human noise, 60 miles behind him, where the railroad ended. But this far-sighted pioneer had brought with him a strong defense against the hush that medins. He had a real house now, the log cabin which he and his nine, his brother and his ten, his two sisters and their 16, had all lived that first summer, was now but a mere wood shed, a joining the kitchen. The house was a fine affair, built from lumber, hauled about 40 miles, so steadily the railroad crept westward, and finished. The one half in wild cherry cut from the creek, and the other half in walnut from the same one source of wood. Since the day of the first McLaughlin alighting, they had arrived altogether to settle more or less near him on land bought from the government, his three brothers and four sisters, his wife's two brothers and one sister, bringing with them the promising sum of 69 children, all valiant enemies of quietness and the fleeing rattlesnakes. Some of the little homes they had built for themselves could be seen that afternoon, like distant specks on the ocean. But Sarah and David had no eyes just then for distant specks. They had grown tired of watching the red calf sleep, and David was trying to make it get up. Finally, in self-defense, it rose, and having found itself refreshed, began gambling about, trying its length of rope, its tail satisfactorily erect. The two had to retreat suddenly to the doorstep, where Huey sat, so impetuous it grew. Huey was not, like the others, at home because he was too small to go to school, indeed no, Huey was ten, and at home today because he had been chilling the day before, with the fever that rose from the newly broken prairie. The three of them sat quiet only for a moment. Why does he frisk his tail so? Davy asked, he's praising the Lord, replied Huey, wise and wan. Is he now exclaimed Davy, impressed? Does God like it? Fine, said Huey, that was an easy one. It's in the song, creeping things in all ye cattle. Davy sat for some time sharing his maker's pleasure in the antics of Happy Caves. Then board, perhaps like his maker, he turned to other things. He rose, and went down the path towards the road, and stood looking down it, in the direction from which the older children must come, surely soon now, from school. Only here and there, along that path where they would appear, was the grass, not higher than the children's heads. In some places it was higher than a man on horseback. There seemed no children in sight. But, wasn't that someone coming down there on the other road? I see somebody coming on the road, Huey. He called. You do not, answered Huey. It wasn't at all likely anybody was coming. Yet, in case anything so unusual was happening, he would just have a look. Sarah waddled after him. Ship a Huey. Was that really something moving down there in the further slow? The three stood still, peering across the prairie, hands sheltering eyes, bear-footed, the boys in the most primitive of homemade overalls, Sarah, in an apron, unadorned. The golden autumn sunshine blowing around them. They stood looking. Then the homecoming children emerged from the tall grass, into which the younger ones were strongly forbidden to go, because children sometimes got fatally lost in it. And at this signal, the three ran to meet them, crying out the news, gaining the little rise of ground again, upon which the house stood, they all paused together to look at whatever it was that true near. Mary, the oldest of them, the teacher, Jesse and Flora, James and Peter. Yes, there was no doubt about it now. Tiss a team, cried Peter. Tiss a pair of grays. He added in a moment. They were all perfectly motionless from curiosity now, who had grays in that neighborhood. There's two men in it. Mary affirms. Then Peter yells, one is wearing blue. They can scarcely breathe now. Blue can it be blue. This is too much for Mary. Run Peter, she cries. To home mother, get father. It has the looks of a soldier. It is three weeks now since the last battle. Since word has come from Wally. The little girls are jumping about in excitement. The children's shouts had not at all disturbed the mother in the kitchen, where she sat sewing, until could she believe her ears? They were shouting, Tiss Wally mother, Tiss Wally. She ran out to the house, down the path. It's never his. She says, unsteadily. But she can't see someone in blue. Someone standing up, waving a cap now. She can see his white face. The children bolts down the road. She can see him. Her black bearded firstborn. The driver is whipping up the horses. Home from battles, pale to the lips. He is in her arms. But she is pailer. Run for your father. She cries to whoever will heed her. The children are pulling at him boisterously. The strange driver is padding his horses. His back to the family reunited. Hugged and kissed and padded and loved. The bearded Wally turns to the stranger. This is Mr. Knight of Tyler, mother. He brought me all the way. Does a kind thing you have done? She exclaims, shaking his hand, devoutly. Oh, he was a soldier. And he didn't look able to walk so far. You're not sick. She cries to Wally, scanning his face. Certainly he was not sick. Now he could have walked it. But he was glad he didn't have to. He adds, smiling and gaugingly at the stranger. They stand together awkwardly. Joyce Mitton, looking at one another, excited beyond words. Then the mother leads the way to the unpainted house. The children hanging to Wally, dancing about. The 15-year-old Andrew was working in the farther apart to the field, just below the house that afternoon. When he saw, from a distance, his father, called by Peter, suddenly leave his plow and run towards the house, surely faster than an old man ever runs. His own team was why bitten and restless, and he left it just long enough to see that in front of the house, there was a team and a light wagon. He unhitched his half-broken young steers, urged them impatiently to the nearest tying place, and hurried to the house. What he saw there made so great in impression on him, that 57 years later, when that stranger's grandson was one of the disheartened veterans of the World War, who came to his office looking for work. The whole scene rose before him, in such poignancy that he had to turn his head away abruptly, remembering. There, in the kitchen, in his mother's chair, sat the stranger in the fine clothes, with a drink of whiskey in his hand, which his father had just poured out. There on the bed, sat his great-gant brother in blue. One trouser leg rolled up to his hairy knee. There on a strip of carpet, in front of the bed, knelt his mother, with a strange white face, soaking bloody rags away from evil-looking sours on that precious foot. There by the cupboard stood Mary, tearing something white into bandages, with the children huddled around her, odd by the sight of their mother. Andy saw all that the moment that Wally, taking up one of the children's old jokes, cried out to him, in a voice that belied his foot, a greeting that the young ones had loved deriding. LANG MEIR LUMBRIK, Andy. There wasn't really anything wrong with Wally, it seemed. That wasn't a wound he affirmed. It was only a scratch. He really couldn't say just how it had happened. It wasn't anything. It might not be anything to a soldier, but to his mother, it was the mark of imminent death for her dearest son. She began rubbing it gently with lamb's fat. Wally, be thinking himself, pulled from a pocket a paper-wrapped bundle of sweeties for the children, who saw such things but seldom. They were intent upon the contents of that, and the stranger was talking to his father. When Andy still standing awkwardly in the door, saw a thing happen, which was a landmark in his understanding. He saw his mother, who had made fast the last bandage, and was carefully pulling down the trouser leg, suddenly bend over, and kiss that leg. Such passion he saw in that gesture that he realized vaguely then, some great fierce hidden thing in life, escaping secrecy only at times, a terrible thing called love, which breaks forth upon occasions, even an old woman like his mother. He turned his face away suddenly, as from some forbidden nakedness, and fixed his eyes upon Wally. That hero, quite unabashed, was pulling his mother, who had risen, down to a seat beside him on the bed. She sat there, unconscious of the room full, just looking at him, looking, as if she could never see his face enough. She watched him devouringly, when presently, with the attention of them all, he began lightheartedly telling about his escape. Half of his regiment had been made prisoners, including his major. They had been marched away towards a train, to be sent south, and he had marched among them until he dropped. He told his captors that they could shoot him if they would, but he couldn't go a step further. They had left him lying helpless there by the roadside, a guard standing over him, and before the wagon came along, which was to pick them up, the guard had slept, and Wally, stronger to run to freedom than to march to prison, had made his escape. Starved and hiding, he had crept night by night towards the Mississippi, and there he had seen a boat, which was bringing northern wounded man home. Tie up at the riverbank to bury it's dead. Its captain had taken pity on him, chilling and nauseated, and had brought him to Davenport. Then, when he had got by train to the nearest Iowa town, this stranger had shown him this kindness. Oh, his mother needn't worry about his being shot for a deserter. They knew him too well in his company, if there was any of them left. And hadn't his chum, Harvey Stow, been home four times to visit, without permission from anyone, and had he ever been punished for it? As soon as he had something to eat, and he could find where to report, he would be going back. Yes, certainly going back. However much his mother caught her breath at the mention of it. It was so interesting to hear him talk that the men could scarcely leave for their duties, but there were the horses to feed, and the cows to milk, and the kind strange team to reward. Mr. Knight followed the boys to the barn, and watched with amusement, however evidently they rubbed down and betted in fed the guests of the stable. And when they came in again, they're sat the scrubbed soldier in a fresh hickory shirt and clean jeans, and his mother's chair, his swath foot on a stool. The stool was hewis thought, and the New York Tribune in his hand. The paper was florist contribution. He was talking grinningly to his mother. A white cloth was spread on the table, and the mother, shining, uplifted with joy, was wiping pink-banded cups, which wally remembered to have seen taken from the sacred shelf only when her scott cousin, who had come to this country to enlighten the darkness of the Yankees by taking the presidency of one of their colleges, had come west to visit this family. Not since then had the scottest sheets been out of the chest, and now they were airing on the line. Toe is an occasion magnificent to consider. When they sat down at the table for supper, and they had not long to wait, for the mother was that woman of whom tradition says, she could make a pair of jeans pants in 20 minutes. They had fried prairie chicken and potatoes and scons and egg butter, and stewed wild plums, sweetened with sugar at 40 cents a pound. The father instituted the feast by a long prayer. Of course, thought the stranger, they were scotch. He counted the children. There were ten. You will have a fine family. He commented. Not so bad when they're all here, returned to the mother complacently. There's a boy in a girl away at school. She paused abruptly. Her boy younger than Wally was killed at Fort Donaldson. Explain the father. My son was wounded there. Last to hand, there was a moment's silence. Then Wally said, wanting the subject changed. It's over now, mother. Grantl will get them now. They proceeded to talk of the coming election. Five families of covenanting scotch in the neighborhood were deserting the principles of their forefathers and taking out naturalization papers, hoping to vote for Lincoln. The visitor wondered vaguely what kind of scotch that might be. He had no chance to ask. The mother seemed to have read every word of the last Tribune. He had hardly time for that himself. She seemed a woman of wide information. Apparently she knew the position of every unit of the army. Supper was over. Flora handed her father at the book. And moved at the candle near him. He found the place and said, the 23rd Psalm. To the man's surprise, the mother began the song in a clear, sure voice. And the children all joined, without hesitation, as if this was a part of a familiar routine. The boys and girls were obviously thinking of the guests of honor. The mother's face was turned to her son. But the father was looking away in a dream to something he seemed to see through the wall before him. When the singing was over, he began reading from the book, words that clearly had some exalted meaning to him, though what it might be, the stranger could not imagine. Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the king of glory shall come in. Who is this king of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. It sounded impressive, read with a subdued ring in the voice. Then he shut the book in a high silence, and they all moved their chairs back, and melt down. The stranger, melt too, somewhat tardily. Not that he objected to prayers, of course. He was a religious man himself, in a way. His wife often went to church. He could see the wrapped face of the father praying in great sonorous phrases, which sounded vaguely familiar. Of all the children he could see, not one had an eye open. They were thanking the Lord for the voice return. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. They proceeded to pray for everyone in the United States, the Presidents and his cabinet, the generals and the colonels and the captains, all the privates, all the sick and homesick, for those destroyed by war, for the morning, and all small children, for slaves in their freedom, and masters in their poverty, and then for the stranger that he might hear the judge say unto him, come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world, where I was sick and ye ministered unto me, that the beauty of the Lord as now might be upon him forever. The stranger had scarcely got over that, when they all began saying the Lord's prayer together, nothing lacking but the collection, he thought, somewhat resentfully. Not having heard a sermon for some time, he had forgotten that. When they rose from their knees, Sarah and David were found a sleep, and he picked them up and carried them away to bed, and even while Mr. Knight was wondering how many of the children he would have to sleep with. The mother took the sheets from beside the stove, and as she started for the fine parlor, whose bed was to be got ready for the guest, she said, lolly is to have the kitchen bed by himself. You all just go upstairs and leave him alone. The stranger had the decency to go soon to his bed. It wasn't a half-bad bed, either. And he was tired. It had been a sudden impulse, this driving the soldier home, with a new team, over no road at all. But he was glad he had come. He had wanted to see this country. The new horses had jogged along very well. Moreover, he had made friends among the scotch, and he was a politician. He thought of his son with Sherman's army. He thought of the soldiers impressive mother. He smiled over the number of children. He slept. But long after the house was quiet, bolly lay talking to his father and mother, who sat on his kitchen bed. He told them of marches and battles and fevers and skirmishes, none of which had endangered him at all, of course. Of the comradeship, among the boys from the Yankee settlement down the creek, and of the hope everywhere, now, that the end was near. Then gradually, they were fell as silence over them, and understanding silence were in each new the other's thoughts. They were all thinking of that first terrible homecoming of his, of the things that led up to it. He remembered how the boys had been eating breakfast in camp, when the orders came, that meant their first battle. He had been in an agony of fear, less he might be afraid. The one good thing about it was that Alan, his brother, had been sent away on a detail, not an hour before. He would go into battle without having his brother to worry about. That trembling, as he advanced, had not been fear, but only a few, so severe he might have stayed behind if he had chosen. But he had advanced with the rest of them, and in the darkness, when he tried to sleep after it was over, he knew he need not fear cowardice again. They had won the day, and they exalted as fiercely as they had fought. Had not their regiments been one of three, which, not getting their orders to retreat, had stood firmly, till fresh troops came to save the day. But the next morning's task had mocked terrifyingly their victory. He could have pleaded fever to escape from that. Some on the snow-covered hillside were digging great trenches. Some were throwing body after body into them. Some were shoveling earth in upon them. He had bent down to target a stiff thing half hidden by snow. He had turned it over. A head grotesquefully twisted backward. A neck, mud plastered, horrible bloody. Then he had cried out, and fallen down, that thing, with the lower face shot away, was Allen. His comrades, hunting about, found the bodies of the others of the little squad that had been hurriedly recalled. That night, Wally planned to desert. He had announced his intention to his lieutenant, who came to sit beside him. They might drum him out of campus a deserter if they would. He was telling them plainly what he intended doing. He would never fight again. But before he was able to walk, his comrades had got him a furlough. They understood only too well his fever and his delirium. And they remembered how he had gone through the battle, vomiting and egg-u shaken, firing with a hand two week to aim, and vomiting again, and shaking and firing. All the way home he had planned how to break the news to his mother. But when he had seen her, his grief, which before had had no outlet, suddenly burst forth, so that even as she asked him, he was sobbing at all out to her. He had never told her, of course, how Allen's sweet singing mouth had been destroyed. For Allen had been a gay lad, playing the fiddle and singing many songs. Sometimes little lovable ones he made, as he sang, about pumpkins, or the old red rooster, or anything that might please the little children. For Wally, no homecoming could ever again be so terrible as that one. But his father and mother, who sat beside him there, were trying not to know that just such news might come at any time of this one, who must go back to deserter place. Wally lay, telling them little things he could recall of those last days. Had he told them of the time that the captain had stood, unbeknown to Allen, behind a bush, listening to him, imitate all the company's officers? There had never been a day that Allen had not been called upon to make fun for his comrades. After had bubbled up within him and gushed out even in stark times. There was no detail of his nonsense, not precious to the two who listened. It was late before they left him, and he soon slept. Towards morning, his mother slept. Soon after daylight, the stranger came into the kitchen. The mother was standing half-hidden by the steam that rose from the milk pills that she was scalding out. The oldest sister at a table where candlelight and dawn struggled together was packing a school lunch into a basket. A small girl was buttoning fat Sarah into her dress. Two small boys were struggling with their shoes on the floor. Wally presently hobbled in from out of doors, declaring himself recovered, a giant refreshed. The stranger noticed that when they found their places at the table, there was a larger child beside each smaller one to look after him. There was one little fellow who looked like the soldier, and a half-ground sister with beautiful regular features like his. But the others were all alike, with deeply set dark blue eyes, long upper lips, and lower faces heavy, keen, determined. He could have appreciated what the mother said sometimes simply to the neighbors, when they remarked how good her children were. Yes, there'd never any care when they were. If we had one or two, we might let them have tantrums, but who could live in a house with 13-year-old parents? Since by that she meant, of course, naughty children, her question seemed indeed unanswerable. Now they sat eating lustily, their cornmeal, and she talked with leisure and understanding. When the meal was finished, Flora handed her father the book again. By Gauly, the stranger said to himself, they're going to do it again. And they did. The mother lifted the song from memory, and then they repeated some part to the Bible. The stranger was the more ill-ad-ease because young Hughie's eyes were fixed accusingly upon him. Again, the father prayed for all the inhabitants of the world, by name or class. When the boys brought the guests wonderful team to the door, all the family gathered to bid him goodbye. Hi, wish you well, sir, for your kindness. The father said, and the mother, at a loss to know how to thank him sufficiently, added, we will never forget this, neither us, nor our children. It was that trembling choked back in her voice that gave the stranger's grandson his work with the firm of Andrew MacOcclin in the fall of 1920. The beautiful grays started impatiently away. The men went to their work, and the children to their school. In the kitchen, his mother bandaged Wollie's feet and put the weans out of door to play, while he had a sleep. At half past eleven he woke. His mother was sitting in the doorway, shelling beans. How was he to guess that she was late with her dinner preparations? Because, again and again, she had to stop, and look at this child of hers, grown a strange man in the midst of horrors unimaginable. He lay very still looking at her. Here, the kettle was singing on the stove. Through the door, he saw the red calf sleeping in the sunshine, a wave of joy, of ecstasy complete past over him. Oh, the heaven of home, the peace of it, of a good bed, of a mother calmly getting dinner. I'm starved, mother. He sang out suddenly to her. She hurried to the seller, and brought him cool milk and two cookies. The children, hearing him, came in to watch him. He sat down in the doorway, and began throwing beans up, and catching them skillfully, to win the friendship of the thoughtful little Sarah. David watched him eagerly. Presently Huey said, Mother, why did John strange man not say the song? You must instaire, so at visitors Huey? But why, mother, why did he not say it? Maybe he didn't a canot. Didn't a canot? The song. Didn't a can the 15th song and him a grown man? Huey had never seen anyone before who couldn't say the 15th song. Oh, mother, he exclaimed, demonstratingly. Even David knows that. Well, he chuckled. He knew the world. He had seen cities. He had marched across states. He had eaten ice cream.

The Great Events by Famous Historians Volume 6, edited by Charles F. Horn, Rossiter Johnson, and John Rudd. An outline narrative. Excending briefly the causes, connections, and consequences of great events, from Barbarossa to Dante, by Charles F. Horn. It was during the period of about 150 years, extending from the middle of the 12th to the close of the 13th century, that the features of our modern civilization began to assume a recognizable form. The age was characterized by the decline of feudalism, and by the growth of all the new influences which combined to create a new state of society. With the decay of the Great Words came the rise of the Great Cities, the increased power and importance of the middle classes, the burgers or citizens who dominate the world today. An opposition to these there came also an unforeseen accession of strength to kings. The boundaries of modern states grew more clearly defined, modern nationalities were distinctly established. Europe assumed something of the outline, something of the social character, which he still retains. The period includes not only the culmination and close of the crusading fervor, but also coincident with this, the culmination of both the religious and the temporal powers of the Popes, and the scarce recognized beginning of their decline. Universities vaguely existent before, now increased rapidly in numbers and importance, which received definite outlines and foundations and exert a mighty influence. In fact it has been not inapply said that the rule of medieval Europe was divided amid three powers, the Emperor, the Pope, and the University of Paris. The Greeks from which we can trace the history of the time became as numerous as before they had been scant and vague, and misleading. Thought reveals itself struggling everywhere for expression, displayed at times in the sunshine of song and rhyme and merry laughter at times in the storms of philosophical dispute and religious persecution. In short this was an age of strife between old ways and new. It's so the granting of Magna Chart, but it's also also the establishment of the Inquisition and the creation of the two great monastic orders, whose opposing methods, the Dominicans ruling by fear and the Franciscans by love, are typical of the contrasting spirits of the time. It was the age which in the next century under Dante's influence was to burst into blossom as the Renaissance. Frederick Barbarossa, not often has one man proven influential enough to dominate an alter the direction of his epic, but very frequently we see one taking advantage of its tendencies and so managing these so directing them that he seems almost to create his surroundings and becomes to all men the expression and example of his times. Such a leader was the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, 1152 to 1190, and we may follow his fortunes in tracing the early part of this era. The first crusade had depleted Europe of half a million fighting men. Then came a pause of 50 years after which it was learned that Jerusalem was again in danger of falling into the hands of Mohammedans. So in 1147, another vast crusading army set out to the rescue. Barbarossa himself went with his second crusade as a young German noble. He was one of the few who was skipped death in the Asian deserts. One of the very few who from the colossal failure of the expedition returned to Europe with added honor and reputation. He was elected Emperor. The crusade had been as deadly as the first, though less successful, and when this nominal leadership of Western Europe was thus conferred on the gallant Frederick, he found the tutonic races weakened by the loss of a million of their most valiant warriors. That is, of the feudal awards and their retainers. Here we find at once one of the great causes of the decay of feudalism. Many of the old families had become wholly extinct, and under the feudal system, their estates lapsed to the overlords, the kings. Other families were represented only by herises, and the marrying of these ladies became a recognized move in the game for power, in which the kings, and especially the Emperor Frederick, now took a foremost part. Previous emperors had been figureheads. Frederick became the real ruler of Europe. The kings of Denmark and Poland fully acknowledged themselves his vassals, so also, though less definitely, did the king of England. For a moment, the imperial unity of Europe seemed reviving. Only one of the Emperor's great dukes had been the line of Saxony, dared to stand against him, and Henry was ultimately crushed. The war cries of the two opponents, however, became eternalized as fractional names in the struggle of Frederick's successors against other foes. For generations, whoever upheld the empire was a vibling, and whoever would attack it on whatsoever plea of wealth. Frederick having established a power in Germany, attempted to assert it in Italy as well, and so the strife passed over the Alps, and became that of Giblin against Gelf, in Italian phrase, of Emperor against Pope, of monarchy against democracy. It was this fatal insistence upon Italian authority that brought disaster upon Frederick, and all his house, and ultimately upon the empire as well, and on the entire German race. The Italians had been quite content to call themselves subjects of a holy Roman empire, which extended but vaguely over Europe, and whose chief took his title from their ancient city, and only came among them to be crowned. They looked at the matter in a holy different light when Frederick regarded his position seriously, and interfered in the affairs with the strong hand, crushing their feuds, and exacting money tribute. Rebellion was promptly kindled, and for twenty years, one German army after another, dwindled away in the passage of the Alps, wasted under the fevers of Italian marshes, or was crushed in desperate battle, by the treaty of Constance in 1183, Frederick confessed the one defeat of his career. He had acknowledged the practical independence of the Italian cities. Cities and kings. The emperor had in fact encountered a power too strong for him. He had been struggling against the beginnings of modern democracy, a system stronger even in its infancy than the ancient rule of the aristocracy, which it has gradually supplanted. The resistance of Italy came not from its knights and lords, but from its great cities, which had been slowly growing more and more self-reliant and independent. The rise of these city republics of the Middle Ages cannot be fully traced. Everywhere, little communities of men seem to have been driven by desperation, to build walls about their group of homes and to defy all commerce. And it was in Italy that the ancient Roman civilization had been most firmly established, and the barbarian dominance, least complete. So it was in Italy that these walled towns, first asserted their importance. In its indeed protected by her marshes, we have seen establishing a somewhat republican form even from her foundation. She, in Genoa and Pisa, defended themselves against the Sarasins and built ships and grew to be the chief maritime powers of the Mediterranean, rulers of island and piers. They fork wars against one another, and Pisa was overwhelmed and ruined in a tremendous conflict with Genoa. Genoa's fleets carried supplies for the first Crusaders. In later Crusades, when the deadly nature of the long journey by land was more clearly known, the wealthy maritime republics were hired to carry the Crusaders themselves to the east and profited vastly by the business. Gradually the inland cities took courage from their seaboard neighbors. Florence became the center of reviving art. Her citizens, the chief bankers, for all Europe. The long became chief of the long barred cities, leading them against the Barbarossa, and when he captured and destroyed the Metropolis in 1161, the burgers of the surrounding Gillesuit towns rally to her help. No sooner was the emperor out of reach, then walls and houses rose again with the speed of magic. Till Milan stood re-incarnate, fair, and stronger than before. A similar though slower growth can be traced among the cities of the north. As early as 1067 we find the town of Mons near Normandy, re-belling against its ward. Still earlier, had Henry, the city builder, fought at wise to strengthen and fortify his peasantry, despite the council of his barons. Indeed, through all the middle ages we find kings and commons drawn often into union by their mutual antagonism to the futile nobility. Al-Berosa, even while he quarreled with the Italian cities, encouraged those of Germany. At the same time that Frederick was thus re-asserting the imperial power, England had a strong king, in Henry II. By wedding the most important feudal aeros in France, Henry added so many provinces to his ancestral French domain of Normandy, that more than half-francely in his possession, and the French kings found that in this overgrown Duke, who was also an independent monarch, they possessed a vassal, far wealthier and more powerful than themselves. Henry took more than one step toward the humiliation, or even subjugation of France, but seems to have been hampered by a real feudal respect for his overlord. Moreover he got into the same difficulty as the emperor. He quarreled with the church and found a too strong for him. Much of his time and most of his energy were devoted to his celebrated struggle against his great bishop, Thomas Beckett. Thus the French king was given time and opportunity to strengthen his sovereignty. Then came the great third crusade, altering and once more upsetting the growing forces of the times, and among its many unforeseen results was the rescue of France from the grip of her tomboyed vassal. The long-threatening recapture of Jerusalem became a fact in 1187. The Christian kingdom established by the first crusade was overthrow, and Emperor Bobberosa and his splendid and revered old age vowed to attempt its reestablishment. Once more did all the nobility of Europe poor eastward, embracing eagerly the purpose of their chief. This was the last great crusade, those that followed being but feeble and unimportant efforts in comparison. Not only was the emperor at its head, but the king of England. Son of Henry II, the famous Richard of the Lion Heart, took up the movement with enthusiasm. So also, though less passionately did Philip Augustus, ableist of the kings of France. No other crusade could boast such names as these. With the mighty undertaking ended in failure. Bobberosa perished in the east, and the glory of his empire died with him. Richard and Philip quarreled about precedence, and the French king seized the opportunity to return home. Full of shrewd plans for the humbling of his obnoxious fassal sovereign. Richard left alone with his dwindling plague-stricken forces, had finally to acknowledge the hopelessness of the cause. On his way home he was seized and imprisoned in Germany. And this, and his death soon after, left the throne to his brother John. Beginnings of modern government. Historians have united to poor upon John every species of a program. Certain it is that he secured his crown by evil means, that he sought to protect it by falsity and treachery. But after all, his rival, Philip Augustus, could be treacherous too. And the main difference between him is that Philip defeated John. He wrenched from him normandy, and many of John's other French provinces, so that the dominion of the English kings were reduced to scarce half their former compass. Hence the appropriate on John. Heavy as the loss might seem, improved in reality a blessing to the English race. Of course, to confine themselves to Great Britain, her kings became truly English, instead of French, which they had been hitherto. England sees to be a mere appenage of Normandy, ruled by Norman Nobles. The Normans who had settled in the island became sharply divided from those who remained in France, and Saxons and English Normans became firmly welded into a united race. This is what England owns to John. Moreover, his tyranny and falsehood led the lower class in his realm to unite with a nobility against him. Thus the deepest class distinction of feudal times between Lord and Serf, the owner and the own, became less marked in the army. The Lord was the most beautiful man, and the Lord was the most beautiful man. He was the most beautiful man, and the most beautiful man. He was the most beautiful man, and the most beautiful man. The function of feudal times between Lord and Serf, the owner and the own, became less marked in England than elsewhere in Europe. The vast threefold struggle which had everywhere to be fought out between kings, nobles, and comments, was an England decided against the kings, by the union of the other two. There combined strength, forced from John the Magna Charter, the Great Charter, the foundation of modern government in England. No of the celebrated document granted don't do privilege to Lord or citizen or peasant. It only confirmed on parchment the right switch John would have denied them. So this also, the cornerstone of liberty, the beginning of constitutional progress, does England owe to her oppressor. Never perhaps as any man devoted to evil, done unwittingly, so much of good is he. Thus the English nation grew united. While the French provinces were brought into closer dependence on their own king. In fact, Philip Augustus, by clever use now of the comments, now of the nobles, succeeded in dominating both. Following his example, his successors managed for many centuries to remain lords of France, with his security and absoluteness of power which no English king, no German Emperor, was ever again to attain. In Germany, the death of Bobberosa left his throne to a short-lived evil son, and then to an infant grandson Frederick II. Other claimants to the realm sprang up, the Great lords asserted and fully established their right to elect what Emperor they pleased. Through this right they made themselves strong, their ruler weak, and so feudalism persisted in Germany, while it was fading in France and England. If it were continued, barren fought against barren, confusion and energy prevailed more and more, and in the march of civilization, Germany was left behind. She lagged for centuries in the rear of her neighbors, staring after them, despising, and vying, scarce comprehending. It is only within the last hundred and fifty years that Germany has re-asserted her ancient place amongst the foremost of the nations. We have said that the only place where Bobberosa failed was in his Italian wars. These were waged against democracy and against the popes. Southern Italy was at this time a kingdom, in central Italy, the Papal states, and north of these were all the independent cities. Assuming the democratic leadership of the cities, the popes acquired a strong temporal power. The growth of these we have traced through earlier periods, it reached its culmination under Pope Innocent III, 1198 to 1216. He almost succeeded to the emperors as the acknowledged ruler of Europe. Secured from Marshall invasion by the strength of the federated cities, as well as by the spiritual dominion which he wielded, Innocent extended his authority over all men and all affairs. He ordered unlawy King John to accept a certain archbishop for England, and when John refused, England was laid under an interdict, that is, no church services could be held there, not even to shrieve the dying or bury the dead. For a while John was scornful, but at length his accumulating troubles forced him to kneel submissively to the Pope, surrender his crown and receive it back as a vassal of the papacy, under obligation to pay heavy tribute. By the same weapon of an interdict, Innocent forced the mighty Philip Augustus to take back a wife, whom he had divorced without people consent, and in Germany, Innocent twice secured the creation of an emperor of his own choice. The second being the child Frederick II, who had been brought up under the Pope's own guardianship. Among other spectacular features of his reign, Innocent founded the Inquisition, and thus formally divorced the church from its earlier preaching of universal peace and love. Moreover he attempted a diversion of the tremendous wasted power of the Crusades. He wanted Holy Wars fork nearer home, and preached to Crusade against John of England, the mere threat brought John to his knees, and Innocent then turned his newfound weapon against the heretics of southern France, the Albedgencies. These unfortunate people, having a certain religious firmness wholly incomprehensible to John, refused submission. The Crusade against them became an actual and awful reality. In the name of Christ, men devastated a Christian country. The spirit of persecution d us aroused became rampant in religion, and remained so for over half a thousand years. Rebels against the church accepted its most evil teaching, and in their brief periods of power became tortures and executioners in their turn. The first of the religious wars achieved its purpose. It exterminated, or at least suppressed the heresy by exterminating every heretic who dare assert himself. Vast numbers of Holy Orthodox Christians perished also, since even they fought against the Crusaders and defending their homes. Word did not change its hideous face because man had presumed to place a blessing on it. Next to Italy, southern France had been the most cultured land of Europe. The Crusaders left it almost to desert. It had been practically independent of the King's Apparise, hence forth it offered them no resistance. A more excusable direction given by innocent to the Crusading enthusiasm was against the Sarasans and Spain. A new and tremendous army of these had come over from Africa to reinforce their brethren, who shared the peninsula with the Spaniards. The Pope's preaching sent 60,000 Crusaders to help the Spaniards against the swarm of invaders, and the Sarasans were completely defeated. The Battle of Navastita Losa in 1212 settled that Spain was to be Christian instead of Muhammad. The later Crusades. Against the Sarasans of the East, however, Crusades grew less and less effective. Geography explains much of history. And Spain the Sarasans were weak because far from the center of their power. In the East, the Europeans were at the same disadvantage. For one man who fell in battle in the Holy Land, 20 perished of starvation or disease upon the journey Viver. Europe began to realize this. The Eastern no longer lowered men with golden glamour that it held for an early-generation. Kings had the contrasted examples of Philip Augustus and the heroic Richard to teach them the value of staying at home. We need glads but briefly at these later Crusades. The fourth was undertaken in 1203. Venice contracted to transport its warriors to the Holy Land, but instead persuade them to join her in an attack upon the decrepit empire of the East. Constantinople fell before their assault and received an hormone emperor. Mordid the religious zeal of these particular followers of the cross every carry them father on their original errand. They were content to establish themselves as kings, dukes and counts in their unexpected empire. Some of the little Frankish states thus created lasted for over two centuries. Though the central power at Constantinople was regained by the Greek emperors of the East in 1261. Meanwhile the patriotic and powerful King Andrew of Hungary led the fifth Crusade. The German emperor Frederick II headed a sixth, in which by diplomacy rather than arms he temporarily regained Jerusalem. For a time this treaty of peace deprived of their occupation the orders of religious knighthood still warring in the East. One of these, the tutonic knights, made friends with Frederick, and by his aid its members were transported to the eastern frontier of Germany, where among the poles and pearl Russians, Prussians they could still find heathen fighting to their taste, from this order of spring the military basis of modern pressure. The seventh and eighth Crusades were the work of the Great French King and St. Louis the 9th, the enthusiasm which had roused the mass of ordinary men to these vath destructive outpouring was faded. Louis had to coax and persuade his people to follow him, and even his earnest purpose in real ability could not save his expeditions from disastrous failure. In the seventh Crusade he attacked not Jerusalem but Egypt. Then the center of Muhammad and power he was defeated and made prisoner. His army was practically exterminated, yet by a personal heroism which shown even more brilliantly an adversity than in success he has won lasting fame. His captivity disrupted an empire. The monologues, the slave soldiers of Egypt, who had fought most valiantly against him, were weakened to a realization of their own power. They overthrew their soul and found an Egyptian government which lasted until Napoleon's time. After much suffering, Louis was allowed to purchase his freedom and return to France. There he spent long years of wise government of noble guidance of his people and of secret preparations which he dared not of all. That length in his old age he confessed to his astounded nation that he meant to make one more attempt against the Sarasans. It was a vow to God he said and he begged his people for assistance. The age had outgrown Crusades. Perhaps no one man and all Louis domains believed in the possibility of his success. History scarce presents anywhere as spectacle more pathetic than this last Crusade, compelled by the fire of a single enthusiast. In love of him his soldiers followed him, though with despair at heart. And the weeping crowds who made them farewell at their ships warned them as men already dead. They attempted to attack the Sarasans first to tunis, and there Louis died of fever, the Crusades perished with him. Pope and Emperor. With the wane of the Crusading Ferver, wained also the power of the Pokes. Innocent had extended his authority by terror and physical force, but men soon seized to find religious inspiration for such holy wars, and the calls of later Pokes fell upon deaf and deers. The democratic policy of innocence predecessors had rallied all Italy around them. But his successors seemed to have failed to recognize their true sources of strength. They abandoned their allies and ruled with autocratic power. Italy became divided, half Gulf, Hagebling, moreover even Frederick II, the war whom innocent had placed on the imperial throne refused to sanction the encroachments of papal authority over the empire. So the strife of Emperor and Pope began again. Only to terminate with the utter defeat and extermination of the great house of Baba Rosa. Their possessions and southern Italy and Sicily were conferred by the Pokes upon Charles of Anju, brother of Louis IX, the France. But while the Pokes were thus temporarily successful in the giant contest against their greatest rival, to such partisan extremes where they driven by the necessities of the struggle that the awakening world looked at them with doubtful eyes, began to question their spiritual rights and honors as well as the temporal authority they claimed. Then Charles of Anju, the Pope soon found that they had but substituted one master for another. Charles was rapidly becoming as obnoxious to Rome as the Emperor's had ever been, when suddenly the tyranny of his French soldiers roused the Sicilians to desperation, and by the massacre of the Sicilian Vespers, the French power in Italy was crushed. Men were slow to realize that the mighty hold which the papacy had once possessed on the deep heart of the world was being sacked at its foundation. Diplomatic pontiffs still managed for a time to play off one sovereign against another, and to have their battles fought by foreign armies on a business basis. As late as the year 1300, the first Greek Jubilee of the Church was celebrated and brought hundreds of thousands of pilgrims flocking to Rome. The papacy, though sorely pressed by many enemies, still proudly asserted its political supremacy, but in truth it had lost its power, not only over the minds of kings to hold them in subjection, not only over the interests of nobles to stir them to revolt, but alas, even over the love of the lower classes to rally them for its defense. Within ten years from the great Jubilee, the papacy meant complete defeat and subjugation at the hands of a far lesser man and feeble a monarch than Frederick II. To the empire, the long contest was as disastrous as to the papacy. When Frederick II at one time the most splendid monarch of Europe died in 1250, a crushed and defeated man, Germany sank into such anarchy is a head-not-known since the days of the Honician invasion. When the emperor was condemned by the church, says an ancient chronicle, ropers made Mary over their booty. Plowshares were beaten into swords, reaping hooks into lances, men went everywhere with flint and steel, setting in ablaze whatsoever they found. The period from 1254 to 1273 is known as the Great Interregnum in German history. There was no emperor, no authority, and every little Lord fought and robbed as he pleased. The cities driven to desperation raised armed forces of their own and united into leagues, which later developed into the Great Hensiatic Lead, more powerful than neighboring kings. The anarchy spread to Italy. Bands of free companies roamed from place to place, plundering, fighting battles, storming world cities, and at last the Pope sent thoroughly frightened word to Germany that the Lord's must elect an emperor to keep order, or he would appoint one himself. The church had learned its lesson, that without a strong civil government, the could not exist, and perhaps the government had at least partly seen what later ages learned more fully. That without religion it could not exist. Church and state were gentler to each other after that. They realized that whatever their quarrels they must stand or fall together. So in 1273 it was the Pope's insistence that led to the selection of another emperor, Rudolph of Habsburg. He was one of the lesser nobles elected by the Great Dukes so that he should be too feeble to interfere with them. But he did it to fear, and overthrew out a car of Bohemia, the strongest of them all, and restored some measure of law and tranquility to distracted Germany. His son he managed to establish as Duke of Austria, and eventually the empire became hereditary in the family, so that the Habsburgs remained rulers of Germany until Napoleon, that upset or of so many comfortable sinicures drove them out. Of Austria, they are emperors even to this day. The Tartars, as though poor to shelved Germany had not troubled sufficient of her own, she suffered also in this century from the last of the Great Aegeanic invasions. About the year 1200, a remarkable military leader, Genghis Khan, appeared among the Tartars, a Mongol race of northern Asia. He organized their wild tribes and started them on a bloody career of repigning conquest. He became Emperor of China, his hordes spread over India and Persia. In 1226 they entered Russia, and after and heroic struggle, the Russian Duchies and republics were forced into submission to the Tartars' yoke. For nearly two centuries, Russia became part, not of Europe, but of Asia, and her civilization received an oriental tinge which, as scarce yet outgrown. The huge Tartar invasion penetrated even to Salisia and eastern Germany, where the agiatics defeated a German army at Leicmets in 1241. But so great was the invaders' loss that they retreated. More did their leaders ever again seek to penetrate the land of the Iron-Claude men. The real yellow peril of Europe, her subversion under the flood of Asia's millions was perhaps possible at Leicmets. It has never been so since. In the construction of impenetrable armor, the inventive genius of the West had already begun to rise superior to the barbaric fury of the East. The arts of civilization were soon to soar immeasurably above mere numerical superiority. In Asia the Tartar power probably reached its greatest height under Kubley Khan, the emperor of China who Marco Polo visited. And it is worth our modern notice that Kubley failed in an attempt to conquer Japan. Russia fell victim to the Tartar hordes. Japan repel them. Progress of constitutional government. While Europe and Asia were thus in turmoil throughout most of this era, England, secure in her island isolation, was making rapid progress on the career of union and free government, where Ron John had so unintentionally started her. The age this adds to its other claims to distinction, that of having seen the beginnings of constitutional government. England's magna charter was paralleled by the golden bull of Hungary, a charter granted by the crusading king Andrew to his tumultuous subjects. In England, the long grain of the week Henry III, son of John, took more and more from the power of the crown. He was opposed by Simon of Montfort, who to secure the affections and support of the common people summoned their representatives to meet in a parliament with the Knights and Bishops. His mad parliament of 1258 contained the first shadow of a government by the people. His later ressemblies were still more democratic. Considered in this light, one likes to remember that Montfort's first assembly, one its title of mad, by passing such excellent laws that none of those in power would submit to them. Following Henry III, Edward I came to the throne, a man of broad views and legal mind. He confirmed and legalized the rights already attained by his subjects. In centralized the authority of all great Britain in his own hands by conquering both Wales and Scotland. The struggles of Sir William Wallace and his devoted followers to throw off the English Yoke ended only in disaster. Edward, the most enlightened and perhaps the most brilliant sovereign of the 13th century, endeavored to protect the Jews, but was finally compelled by the clamor of his subjects to expel the unfortunate race from his domains. He however permitted the exiles to take their wealth with them, and the scarcity thus created was one of the contributing causes which compelled him to promise his parliament not to lead taxes without their consent. It was by this power to control the person of King and Country that parliament finally established itself as the Supreme Power in England. It bought each one of its concessions, each added authority. So that we may fairly figure that from this time trade becomes as important as war. Gold begins to seem to men not only more attractive, but more powerful than iron. The age of root strength is passed, the age of schemes and subtle policies begun. The merchant dominates the night.

From the eagles of acting modern society, their causes and remedies, in cyclical letter in scrutabbly, April 21, 1878. When, by gods on search will design, we, though all unworthy, were raised to the height of apostolic dignity, at once we felt ourselves moved by an urgent desire, and, as it were, the necessity to address you by letter, not merely to express to you our very deep feeling of love, but further, in accordance with the task entrusted to us from heaven, to strengthen you who are called to share our solicitude, that you may help us to carry on the battle now being waged on behalf of the Church of God and the salvation of souls. For, from the very beginning of our pontificate, the sad sight has presented itself to us, of the eagles by which the human race is oppressed on every side. The widespread subversion of the primary truths, on which, as on its foundations, human society is based. The obstinacy of mind that will not broke any authority, however lawful. The endless sources of disagreement, when survive civil strife, and ruthless war, and a bloodshed. The contempt of law, which molds characters, and is the shield of righteousness. The insatiable craving for things perishable, with complete forgetfulness of things eternal, leading up to the desperate madness whereby so many wretched beings, in all directions, group or not to lay violent hands upon themselves. The reckless mismanagement, waste, and misappropriation of the public funds. The shamelessness of those who, full of treachery, make semblance of being champions of country, of freedom, and every kind of right. Infined, the deadly kind of plague which infacts society in its innmost recesses, allowing me at no respite and foreboding ever, fresh disturbances, and final disaster. Now the source of these evils lies chiefly, where I convinced, in this, have the holy and venerable authority of the church, which, in God's name, rules mankind, upholding and defending all lawful authority, has been despised and set aside. The enemies of public order, being fully aware of this, have thought nothing better suited to destroy the foundations of society, than to make an unflagging attack upon the church of God, to bring her into discredited and odium by spreading infamous calamities and accusing her of being opposed to genuine progress. They labored to weaken her influence and power by wounds daily inflicted, and to overthrow the authority of the bishop of Rome, in whom the abiding and unchangeable principles of right and good find their earthly guardian and a champion. From these causes have originated laws that shake the structure of the Catholic church, the enacting whereof we have to deploy in so many lands, hence two of flowed forth, contempt of a piscobl authority, the obstacles thrown in the way of the discharge of ecclesiastical duties. The dissolution of religious bodies, and the confiscation of property that was once the support of the church's ministers and of the poor. The evapublic institutions, vowed to charity and benevolence, have been withdrawn from the wholesome control of the church. Then it also has a reason that unchecked freedom to teach and spread abroad or mischief of us principles, while the church is claimed to train and educate youth is, in every way, outraged and baffled. Such too is the purpose of the sazion of the temporal power, conferred many centuries ago by divine providence on the bishop of Rome, that he might, without later hindrance, use the authority conferred by Christ, for the eternal welfare of the nations. We've recalled to your minds venerable brothers, this deathly massive ills, not to increase the sorrow naturally caused you by this most sad state of things, but because we believe that from its consideration you will most plainly see how serious are the matters claiming our attention, as well as devertedness, and with what energy we should work, and more than ever under the present adverse conditions, protect, so far as inner slice, the church of Christ and the honor of the apostolic sea, the objects of so many slanders, and assert their claims. It is perfectly clear and evident venerable brothers, that the very notion of civilization is a fiction of the brain if it rests not on the abiding principles of truth and the changing laws of virtue and justice, and if unfained love knit not together the wheels of men, and a gently control the interchange and a character of their mutual service. Now who would make bold to deny that the church, by spreading the gospel throughout the nations, has brought the light of truth among people utterly savage and steeped in foul superstition, and has quickened them alike to recognise the divine author of nature, and, surely, to respect themselves. Further, who would deny that the church is done away with the curse of slavery, and restored men to the original dignity of their noble nature, and, by uplifting the stand of the redemption in all quarters of the globe, by introducing or shielding under her protection, the sciences and arts, by founding and taking into her keeping excellent charitable institutions, which provide relief for ills of every kind, has throughout the world, in private or in public life, civilised the human race, freed it from degradation, and, with all care, trained it to a way of living, such as the fixed dignity and the hopes of men, and if anyone of sound mind compare the age in which we live, so hostile to religion, and to the church of Christ, with those happy times when the church was revered as mother by the nations, beyond all question, he will see that our epoch is rushing wildly along the straight road to destruction. While in those times, which most abounded in excellent institutions, peaceful life, wealth, and prosperity, the people showed themselves most obedient to the church's rule and laws. Therefore, if there many blessings we have mentioned, due to the agency and saving help of the church, are the true and worthy outcome of civilisation. The church of Christ, far from being alien to, or neglectful of progress, has adjusted claim to all men's praise as its nurse, its mistress, and its mother. Furthermore, that kind of civilisation, which conflicts with the doctrines and laws of Holy Church, is nothing but a worthless imitation and a meaningless name. Of this, those people, on whom the gospel light has never shown a thought ample proof, since in their mode of life, a shadowy semblance only a civilisation is discoverable, while its true and solid blessings have never been possessed. Undoubtedly, that cannot, by any means, be accounted the perfection of civilised life, sets all legitimate authority boldly at defiance. Nor can that be regarded as a liberty, which, shamefully, and by the vileist means, spreading false principles and freely indulging the central gratification of lustful desires, claims impunity for all crime and misdemeanor, and thwart the goodly influence of the worldiest citizens of whatsoever class. Delusive, perverse, and misleding as are these principles, they cannot possibly have any inherent power to perfect the human race and fill it with blessing, for sin-makeeth nations miserable. Proverbs 14 verse 34 Such principles, as a matter of course, must hurry nations corrupted in mind and heart, into every kind of infamy, we can all write order, and thus sinner or later, bring the standing and peace of the state to the very brink of ruin. Again, if we consider the achievements of the sea of Rome, what can be more wicked than to the nahe how much and how well the Roman bishops have served civilised society at large, for our predecessors to provide for the people's good, encountered struggles of every kind, endured to the utmost burdensome toil, and never hesitated to expose themselves to most dangerous trials. With eyes fixed on heaven, they neither bowed down their heads before the threats of the wicked nor allow themselves to be led by flattery or brides into unworthy compliance. This apostolic chair it was that gathered and held together the crumbling remains of the old order of things. This was the kindly light by whose help the culture of Christian times shonfar and wide. This was an anchor of safety in the fierce storms by which the human race has been convalzed. This was the sacred bond of union that linked together nations distant in region and differing in character. In short, this was a common center from which it was sought, instruction in faith and religion, no less than guidance and advice for the maintenance of peace and the functions of practical life. In very truth, it is the glory of the supreme pontiffs that they steadfastly set themselves up as a wall and a bow-wark to save human society from falling back into its former superstition and barbarism. Would that this healing authority had never been slighted or set aside? assuredly, neither would the civil power have lost that venerable and sacred glory, the lustrous gift of religion, which alone renders the state of subjection noble and worthy of man. Nor would so many revolutions and wars have been fermented to ravage the world with disillusion and bloodshed. Nor would kingdoms, once so flourishing, but now fallen from the height of prosperity, like crushed, beneath the weight of every kind of calamity. Of this, the peoples of the east also furnish an example, who, by breaking the most sweet yoke, that bound them to this apostolic sea, forefoot at the splendour of their former greatness, their renowned insights and art, and the dignity of their sway. Of all these remarkable benefits, however, which are lustrous monuments of all ages, proved to have flowed upon every quarter of the world from the apostolic sea, this land of Italy has had the most abounding experience. For it has derived advantages from the sea of Rome, proportionate to the greater nearness of its natural situation. Unquestionably, to the Roman Pontiffs, it is that Italy must earn herself indebted for the substantial glory and majesty, by which she has been pre-eminent amongst nations. The influence and fatherly care of the popes have upon many occasions she ordered her from hostile attack and brought her relief and aid. The effect of which is that Catholic faith has been ever maintained in violet in the hearts of Italians. These services of our predecessors, to omit mention of many others, have been witness to in a special manner by the records of the times of Saint Leo the Great, Alexander the Third, innocent the Third, Saint Pius the Fifth, Leo the Tenth, and other Pontiffs, by whose exertions or protection Italy has escaped unscades from the utter destruction threatened by barbarians. As kept unimped her old faith and amid the darkness and defilement of a ruder age, has cultivated and preserved in vigor the lustre of science and the splendour of art. To this furthermore bears witness our own fostering city, the home of the Popes, which under their rule, reaped this special benefit that it not only was the strong citadel of the faith, but also became the refuge of the liberal arts and the very abode of culture, winning for itself the admiration and respect of the whole world. As these facts in all her amplitude have been handed down in historical records, while the perpetual remembrance of posterity, it is easy to understand that it is only with hostile design and shameless calamity meant to mislead men that anyone can venture in speech and in writing to accuse the apostolic sea of being an obstacle to the civil progress of nations and to the prosperity of Italy. Seeing therefore that all the hopes of Italy and of the whole world lie in the power so beneficent to the common good and profit, where with the authority the apostolic sea is endowed and in the close union which binds all the faithful of Christ to the Roman Pontiff, we recognise that nothing should be nearer our heart than how to preserve safe and sound the dignity of the Roman sea and a strengthen evermore and more the union of members with the head of the children with their father. Weir for that we may above all things and in every possible way maintain the rights and freedom of this holy sea which will never cease to strive that our authority may meet with due difference that obstacles may be removed which hamper the free exercise of our ministry and that we may be restored to that condition of things in which the desire of God's wisdom had long ago placed at the Roman Pontiff. We are moved to demand this restoration venerable brethren not by any feeling of ambition or desire of supremacy but by the nature of our office and by our sacred promise confirmed on oath and further not only because his sovereignty is essential to protect and preserve the full liberty of the spiritual power but also because it is an ascertained fact that when the temporal sovereignty of the apostolic sea is in question the cause of the public good and the well-being of all human society in general are also at stake. Hence we cannot omit in the discharge of our duty which obliges us to guard the rights of holy church to renew and confirm in every particular by this our letter those declarations and protests which pieced the ninth of sacred memory our predecessor on many and repeated occasions published against the seas of the civil sovereignty and the infringement of rights belonging to the Roman church. At the same time we address ourselves to princes and chief rulers of the nations and earnestly besieged them in the Auguste name of the most high god not to refuse the church's aid offered them in a season of such need but with united and friendly aims to join themselves to her as the source of authority and salvation and to attach themselves to her more and more in the bonds of hearty love and devotedness. God grants that seeing the truth of our words and considering within themselves that the teaching of Christ is as a guest on use to say a great blessing to the state if obeyed a pistol a 138 ad marshalus number 15 and that their own peace and safety as well as that of their people is bound up with the safety of the church and the reverence of due to her they may give their whole thought and care to mitigating the evils by which the church and its visible head are harassed and so it may last come to pass had the peoples whom they governed may enter on the way of justice and peace and rejoice in a happy era of prosperity and glory. In the next place in order that the union of hearts between their chief pastor and the whole Catholic flock may daily be strengthened we hear call upon you venerable brothers with particular earnestness and strongly urge you to kindle with priestly zeal and pastoral care the fire of the love of religion among the faithful entrusted to you. Though their attachment to this chair of truth and justice may become closer and firmer that they may welcome all its teachings with thorough a scent of mind and will, holy rejecting such opinions even when most widely received as they know to be contrary to the church's doctrine. In this matter the Roman Pontiffs, our predecessors and last of all, pieced the ninth of sacred memory, especially in the general counsel of the Vatican have not neglected so often as there was need to condemn widespreading errors and to smite them with the apostolic condemnation. This they did, keeping before their eyes the words of St. Paul. But we're at least any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit according to the tradition of men according to the elements of the world and not according to Christ. Later to the Colossians, chapter 2, verse 8. All such sensures we following the steps of our predecessors do confirm and renew from this apostolic seat of truth whilst we earnestly ask of the Father of Light that all the faithful brought to Thara agreement in the like feeling and the same belief may think and speak even as ourselves. It is your duty for inter-able brothers, saidurously to strive that the seed of heavenly doctrine be so broadcast in the field of God and that the teachings of the Catholic faith may be implanted early in the souls of the faithful may strike deep root in them and may be kept free from the ruinous blight of error. The more the enemies of religion exert themselves to offer the uninformed, especially the young, such instruction as darkened to the mind and corrupts morals, the more actively should we endeavor that not only a suitable and solid method of education may flourish, but above all, that this education be wholly in harmony with the Catholic faith in his literature and system of training and chiefly in philosophy upon which the foundation of other sciences in great measure depends. Philosophy seeks not the overthrow of divine revelation, but the Light's rather to prepare its way and defend it against the salons, both by example and in written works, as the great Augustan and the angelic doctor with all other teachers of Christian wisdom have proved to us. Now, the training of youth most conducive to the defence of true faith and religion and to the preservation of morality must find its beginning from an early stage within the circle of home life. And this family Christian training sadly undermined in these our times cannot possibly be restored to its due dignity, saved by those laws under which it was established in the church by her divine founder himself. Our Lord Jesus Christ, by raising to the dignity of a sacrament, the contract of matrimony in which he would have his own union with the church typified, not only made the marriage tie more holy, but in addition, provided efficacious sources of aid for parents and children alike, so that by the discharge of their duties one to another, they might, with greater ease, attain to havingness both in time and in eternity. But when in pious laws setting at north the sanctity of this great sacrament, put it on the same footing with mere civil contracts, the lamentable result followed that outraging the dignity of Christian matrimony, citizens made use of legalised conchubanage in place of marriage, husband and wife neglected their bound and duty to each other. Children refused obedience and reverence to their parents. The bonds of domestic love were loosened, and, alas, the worst scandal, and of all, the most ruinous to public morality, very frequently and unholy passion, opened the door to disastrous and fatal separations. These most unhappy and painful consequences, venerable brothers, cannot fail to arouse your zeal, and move you constantly and earnestly, to warn the faithful committed to your charge, to listen with desility, to your teaching, regarding the holiness of Christian marriage, and to obey the laws, by which the church controls the duties of married people, and of their offspring. Then indeed, will that most desirable result come about, that the character and conduct of individuals also will be reformed, for justice from a rotten stock are produced healthless branches, or worthless fruits, so to the ravages of epistolence, which ruins the household, spread wide their cruel infection to the hurt and injury of individual citizens. On the other hand, when domestic society is fashioned, in the bold Christian life, each member will gradually grow accustomed to the love of religion and party, to the appearance of false and harmful teaching, to the pursuit of virtue, to obedience to elders, and to the restraint of that insatiable seeking after self-interest alone, which so spoils and weakens the character of men. To this end, it will certainly help not a little, to encourage and promote those pious associations which have been established in our own times, especially, with so great profit to the cause of the Catholic religion. Great indeed, and beyond the strength of men are these objects of our hopes and prayers venerable brothers. But since God has made the nations of the earth for health, Book of Wisdom, chapter 1, verse 14, when He founded the church for the welfare of the peoples, and promised that He will abide with her, by his assistance to the end of the world. We firmly trust that, through your endeavors, the human race, taking warning from so many evils and visitations, will submit themselves at length to the church, and turn for health and prosperity to the infallible guidance of this apostolic sea. Meanwhile, venerable brothers, before bringing this letter to a close, we must express our congratulations on the striking harmony and concord, which unites your minds among yourselves, and with this apostolic sea. This perfect union, we regard, as not merely an impregnable bulwark against hostile attacks, but also as an auspicious and happy omen, presaging bed at times for the church. And while it yields great relief to our weakness, it seasonably encourages us to endure with readiness, all labors, and all struggles on behalf of God's church, in the arduous task which we have undertaken. Moreover, from the causes of hope and rejoicing, which we have made known to you, we cannot separate those tokens of love and obedience which you, venerable brethren, in these first days of our pontificate, have shown our lyrliness, and with you so many of the clergy in the faithful, who, by letters sent, by offering us given, by pilgrimages undertaken, by other works of love, and made it clear that the devotion and charity which they manifested to our most worthy predecessor, still last, so strong and steadfast and unchanged, as not to slacken towards the person of a successor so much inferior. For these splendid tokens of Catholic party, we humbly confess to the Lord that He is good and gracious, while to you venerable brothers, and to all our beloved children, from whom we have received them, we publicly, from the bottom of our heart, about the grateful feelings of our soul, cherishing the fullest confidence that in the present critical state of things, and in the difficulties of the times, this, your devotion and love, and the devotion and love of the faithful will never fail us. Nor have we any doubt that these conspicuous examples of filial party and Christian virtue will be of such a veil as to make our most merciful God, moved by the beautiful deeds, look with favor on His flock, and grant the church peace and victory. But as we assure that this peace and victory will more quickly and more readily be given us, if the faithful are unremitting in their prayers and supplications to obtain it, we earnestly exhort you venerable brothers to stir up for this end, the zeal and ardor of the faithful, taking the emaculate queen of heaven as their intercessor with God, and having recourse as their advocates to Saint Joseph, the heavenly patron of the church, and to saints Peter and Paul, the princes of their apostles. To the powerful patronage of all these, we humbly commit our lyrliness, all ranks of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and all the flock of Christ, our Lord. For the rest, we trust that these days, are which we renew the memory of Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, may be to you venerable brothers, and all the fold of God, a source of blessing and salvation, and fullness of Holy joy, praying our most gracious God, that by the blood of the Lamb without spot, which plotted out the handwriting that was against us, the sins we have committed, may be washed away, and the judgment we are suffering for them may mercifully be mitigated. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Second, let it to the Corinthians, chapter 13, verse 13, venerable brothers. To each and all of whom, as well as to our beloved children, the clergy and faithful of the other churches, as a pledge of our special good will, and as an earnest to the protection of heaven, we lovingly impart the apostolic benediction.

That story of love and crime, which figures in the records of the New York detective bureau as the Yacht Mystery, has little to do with yachts and is no longer a mystery. It is concerned far more intimately with the troubles and trials of pretty Winifred Bartlett than with the vagaries of restless sea. The alert well groomed figure of Winifred's true lover, Rex Carshaw, fills its pages to the almost total exclusion of the Portley millionaire who owned the Salsucy. Yet such is the singular dominance exercised by the trivial things of life over the truly important ones. Some hundreds of thousands of people in the great city on the three rivers will recall many episodes of the nine days wonder, known to them as the yacht mystery, though they may never have heard of either Winifred or Rex. It began simply as all major events too begin, and of course, at the outset neither of these two young people seem to have the remoders connection with it. On the evening of October 5, 1913, that is the date when the first entry appears in the diary of Mr. James Stingol Chief of the Bureau, the stream of traffic in Fifth Avenue was interrupted to an unusual degree at a corner near 42nd Street. The homework bound throng going up town and the equally dense crowd coming downtown to restaurants and theater land merely chafed at a delay which they did not understand, but that's the traffic policeman knew exactly what was going on and kept his head and temper. A few doors down the north side of the cross street, a famous club was ablaze with lights. Especially did three great windows on the first floor, and fourth hospital beams, for the spacious room within was the scene of an amusing revel. Mr. William Peerpaunt van Hoffen, ex-comador of the New York Yacht Club, owner of the San Suzie and multi-millionaire, had just astonished his friends by one of the eccentric chests forward she was famous. This also see notable in the world over for its size, speed, and fittings was going out of commission for the winter. Then Hoffen had marked the occasion by widespread invitations to a dinner at his club, quote, to be followed by a surprise party and quote, and the nature of the surprise was becoming known. Each lady had drawn by lots the name of her dinner partner, and each couple was then presented with a sealed envelope containing tickets for one or other of the many theaters in New York. Thus, not only were husband's wives, eligible bachelor's, and smart debutants, inextricably mixed hop, but none knew whether the oddly assorted pairs were bound, since the envelopes were not to be opened until the meal reached the coffee and cigarette stage. There existed two secret within a secret. Seven men were bitten privately to come on board the San Suzie, moored in the Hudson off the 86th street landing stage, and their enjoy a quiet session of auction bridge. We'll duck before the trouble gets fairly started, explained Van Hoffen to his cronies. You will see how the bunches sorted out that dinner, but the tangles then will be just one sent in the dollar to depend on a moan, when they find out where they're going. Of course, everybody was acquainted with everybody else, or the joke might have been in bad taste. Moreover, as the gathering was confined exclusively to the elect of New York society, the host had notified the detective bureau and requested the presence of one of their best men outside the club shortly before eight o'clock. One realized better than he, that where the carcass is, there the vultures gather, and he wanted no untoward incidents to happen during the confusion, which must attend the departure of so many richly-be-jeweled ladies accompanied by unexpected cavaliers. Thus it befell that detective inspector Clancy was detailed for the job. Clancy was a blind-gall, and he, who were the inseparable of the bureau, yet no two members of a marvellously efficient service, were more unlike physically and mentally. Stylgall was big, blonde, muscular, a genial giant whose qualities rendered him almost popular among the very criminals he hunted, whereas those same desparados feared the diminutive fancy, the little slight dark-haired sleuth of French Irish descent. He, they were aware instinctively, read their very souls before Stylgall's huge paw clutched their quaking bodies. I don't chance alone decided that Clancy should undertake the half-hours vigil at the uptown club that evening. While unknowing, he became thereby the controlling influence in many lives. At 8 o'clock, an elderly man emerged from the building and edged his way through the cheery, laughing people, already grouped about the doorway and awaiting automobiles. Mr. William Michael John might have been branded with the word Senator, so typical was he of the Overehouse at Washington. The very cut of his clothes, the style of his shoes, the glossiness of his hat, even the wide expanse of Pearl-studded white linen, marked him as a person of consequence. A uniformed policeman, striving to keep the pavement clear of loiterers, recognized and saluted him. The salute was returned, though its recipients face seemed to be gloomy, preoccupied, almost disturbed. Therefore he did not notice a gaunt, angular jod woman, one whose carriage and attire suggested better days long since passed, who had been peering eagerly at the revelers pouring out of the club, and now stepped forward impetuously as if to intercept him. She failed. The policeman barred her progress quietly, but effactually, and the woman, if bent on achieving her purpose, must have either called after the absorbed Michael John, or entered into a heated altercation with the policeman when accident came to her aid. Mrs. Ronald Tower, strikingly handsome, richly downed and cloaked, with an elaborate coffee that outwired nature's best efforts, was crossing the pavement to enter a waiting car when she stopped and drew her hand from her escorts arm. Under her Michael John, she cried, the elderly man halted, he doft his hat with a flourish, a hellen, he sense smilingly, with her bound. To see Balasko's latest isn't that lucky, the very thing I wanted, poor Ronald, I don't know what has become of him, or into what net he may have fallen, and the senator veamed. He knew that Ronald Tower was one of the eight-pridge players, but was pledged to two secrecy. I only hailed you to jog your memory about that luncheon tomorrow, went on Mrs. Tower. How could I forget, he retort gallantly, only two hours ago I postponed a business appointment on account of it. So good of you, Senator, and Mrs. Tower's smile lent a tinge of sarcasm to the words, I'm awfully anxious that you should meet Mr. Jacob. I'm deeply interested, you know. Michael John glanced rather sharply at the ladies' companion, who, however, was merely a vacuous man about town. It struck Clancy that the senator resented this in the cautious using of names. The Shabby Gentile woman hovering behind the policeman was following the scene with hawk like eyes, and Clancy kept her two under close observation. The senator coughed and lowered his voice. I shall be most pleased to discuss matters with him. He said, it will be a pleasure to render him a service if you ask it. Mrs. Tower laughed lightly. One o'clock she said, don't be late. Come along, Mr. Forest. Your car is blocking the way. Mr. Michael John Flourish just had again. He turned and found himself face to face with the hard-featured woman who had been waiting and watching for this very opportunity. She barred his further progress, even got his arm. And the senator been assaulted by the blue-coded guardian of law and order, he could not have displayed more be-wildermint. You, Rachel, he gasped. The policeman was about to intervene, but it was the senator, not the Shabby dressed woman who prevented him. It's all right, officer. He stammered, vexedly. I know this lady, she's an old friend. The man saluted again and drew aside. Clancy moved a trifle mirror. No one would take notice of such an insignificant little man. Though he had his back to this strangely assorted pair, he heard nearly every syllable they uttered. He is here, snapped the woman, without other preamble, you must see him. It is quite impossible, was the answer. And, though the words were frigid and unyielding, Clancy felt certain that senator Michael John had to exercise and iron self-control to keep a trimer out of his utterance. You dare not refuse, persisted the woman. The senator glanced around in a scared way. Clancy thought for an instant that he meant to dart back into the security of the club. After an irresolute pause, however, he moved somewhat apart from the count of sightseers, the two stood together on the curb and clear of the flood of light pouring through the open doors, Clancy edged after them. He gathered a good deal, not all of what they said, as both voices were harsh and tinned with excitement. This very night, the woman was saying, bring at least $500. If the police says he will confess everything, do you get me? This thing had weight. The senator did not even try now to conceal his agitation. He looked at the gaping mob, but it was wholly absorbed in the stream of fashionable people pouring out of the club, while the snorting of scores of automobiles created a den which meant comparative safety. Yes, yes, he muttered, I understand. I'll do anything in reason. I'll give you the money, and you know he means seeing you. You need not be afraid. He says you are going to Mr. Manhoff and yacht at 9 o'clock. Good lord, broken Michael John. How can he possibly know that? Again, he peered at the press of onlookers. A dapper, little man, who stood near, was raised on tiptoe, and graining his neck to catch a glimpse of a noted beauty, and when just appeared, I'll pull yourself together, and there was a touch of scorn in the woman's manner, as she reassured this powerfully built man. Isn't he clever and fertile in device? Haven't the newspapers announced your presence on the San Sufi? And who will stop a steward's tongue from wagging at any rate? He knows. He will be on the Hudson in a small boat with one other map. At 9 o'clock, he will come close to the landing stage at 86th Street. There's a lawn north of the clubhouse, he says. Walk to the end of it, and you will find him. You can have a brief talk, bring the money in an envelope. On the lawn, at 9, repeated the senator in a day-toe's way. Yes, what better place could he choose? You see, he is willing to play fair and be discreet. But quick, I must have your answer. Time is passing. Do you agree? What is the alternative? Capture, and a mad rage, then others will share in his downfall. Very well, I'll be there. I'll not fail him. Or you. He says, it's it last request. He has some scheme. Ah, his schemes. I only I could hope that this will be the end. That is his promise. The woman dropped the conversation abruptly. She darted through the line of cars and made off in the direction of sixth Avenue. Senator Michael John gazed after her dubiously, but her tall figure was soon lost in the traffic. Then with bent head and evidently a prey to harassing thoughts, he crossed Fifth Avenue. Clancy slanted after him, and saw him enter a block of residential flats in a side street, then the detective strung back to the club. Most of then-huffin's guests had gone, the policeman-grinned and muttered in Clancy's ear. The senators are giddy, guy. Two of them at once, Mrs. Tower's a good looker, but I didn't think much of the other one. Clancy nodded. His black and BDIs had just clashed with those of Aintatoria's crook, who suddenly remembered and urgent appointment elsewhere. Fifth-game minutes later, saw Senator Michael John returned. He entered the club without being way late a second time. Clancy consulted his watch. Keep a sharp lookout here, Mac. He said, sop the voci. While I was away just now, Broadway Jim showed up. He's got cold feet, and there I'll be nothing during tonight, I think. Anyhow, I'm going uptown. In Fifth Avenue, he boarded a Riverside Drive bus. The weather was mild, and he mounted to the roof. Now, who in the world will Senator Michael John meets on the landing stage? He mused? Thanks to me, the chief may be interested. $500, too. I wonder.

Recording by Colleen McMahon. awful disclosures of the hotel due notary of Montreal by Maria Munk. But I must now come to one deed, in which I had some part, and which I look back upon with greater horror and pain, than any occurrences in the convent in which I was not the principal suffer. It is not necessary for me to attempt to excuse myself in this or any other case. Those who have any disposition to judge fairly will exercise their own judgment in making allowances for me, under the fear and force, the commands and examples around me. I therefore shall confine myself as usual to the simple narrative of facts. The time was about five months after I took the bail. The weather was cool, perhaps in September, October. One day the superior set for me and several other nuns to receive her commands at a particular room. We found the bishop and some priests with her, and speaking in an unusual tone of fierceness and authority, she said, go to the room for the examination of conscience and drag St. Francis upstairs. Nothing more was necessary than this unusual command, with the tone and manner which accompanied it to excite in me most gloomy anticipations. It did not strike me as strange that St. Francis should be in the room to which the superior directed us. It was an apartment to which we were often sent to prepare for the communion, and to which we voluntarily went whenever we felt the compunctions which are ignorance of duty, and the misinstructions we received inclined us to seek relief from self-reproach. Indeed, I had seen her there a little before. What terrified me was first, the superior's angry manner. Second, the expression she used, being a French term, whose peculiar use I had learned in the convent, and whose meaning is rather softened when translated into drag. Third, the place to which we were directed to take the interesting young man, and the person's assembled there as I suppose to condemn her. My fears were such concerning the faith that awaited her, and my horror at the idea that she wasn't some way to be sacrificed, that I would have given anything to be allowed to stay where I was. But I feared the consequences of disobeying the superior, and proceeded with the rest toward the room for the examination of conscience. The room to which we were to proceed from that was in the second story, and the place of many a scene of a shameful nature. It is sufficient for me to say after what I have said in other parts of this book, the things had there occurred which made me regard the place with the greatest disgust. St. Francis had appeared melancholy for some time. I well knew she had caused for she had been repeatedly subject to trials, which I need not name, are common lot. When we reached the room where we had been bitten to seek her, I entered the door, my companion standing behind me, as the place was so small as hardly to hold five persons at a time. The young nun was standing alone near the middle of the room. She was probably about 20, with light hair, blue eyes and a very fair complexion. I spoke to her in a compassionate voice, but at the same time, with such a decided manner that she comprehended my full meaning. St. Francis, we are sent for you. Several others spoke kindly to her, but too addressed her very harshly. The poor creature turned round with a look of meekness, and without expressing any unwillingness or fear, without even speaking a word, resigned herself to our hands. The tears came into my eyes. I had not a moment stout that she considered her fate as seal, and was already beyond the fear of death. She was conducted or rather hurried to the staircase which was nearby, and then seized by her limbs and clothes, and in fact almost dragged upstairs in the sense the superior had intended. I laid my own hands upon her, I took hold of her too. More gently indeed than some of the rest, yet I encouraged and assisted them in carrying her. I could not avoid it. My refusal would not have saved her, nor prevented her from being carried up. It would only have exposed me to some severe punishment, as I believed some of my companions would have seized the first opportunity to claim of me. All the way up the staircase, Saint Francis spoke not a word, nor made the slightest resistance. When we entered with her, the room to which she was ordered, my heart sunk within me. The bishop, the lady superior, and five priests, vis-bonin, Richards, Savage, and two others, I now ascertained, were assembled for her trial on some charge of great importance. When we had brought our prisoner before them, father Richards began to question her, and she made ready but calm replies, I cannot pretend to give a connected account of what ensued. My feelings were wrought up to such a pitch that I knew not what I did, nor what to do. I was under a terrible apprehension that if I betrayed the feelings which almost overcame me, I should fall under the displeasure of the cold-blooded persecutors of my poor and assistant sister. And this fear on the one hand, with the distress I felt for her on the other, rendered me almost frantic. As soon as I entered the room, I had stepped into a corner on the left of the entrance, where I might partially support myself by leaning against the wall, between the door and the window. This support was all that prevented me from falling to the floor, for the confusion of my thoughts was so great, that only a few of the words I heard spoken on either side made any lasting impression upon me. I felt as if struck with some insupportable blow, and death would not have been more frightful to you, man. I am inclined to the belief that Father Richards, which dishealed the poor prisoner from the severity of her fate, by drawing from her expressions that might bear a favorable construction. He asked her among other things if she was not sorry for what she had been over her to say, for she had been betrayed by one of the nuns, and if she would not prefer confinement in the cells to the punishment, which was threatened her, but the bishop soon interrupted him, and it was easy to perceive that he considered her fate a sealed, and was determined she should not escape. And reply to some of the questions put to her, she was silent. To others I heard her voice reply that she did not repent and word she had uttered. They had been reported by some of the nuns who had heard them, that she still wished to escape from the convent, and that she had firmly resolved to resist every attempt to compel her to the commission of crimes which she detested. She added that she would rather die than cause the murder of harmless babes. That is enough, finish her, said the bishop. Two nuns instantly fell upon the young woman, and an obedience to directions given by the superior, prepared to execute her sentence. She still maintained all the calmness and submission of a lamb. Some of those who took part in this transaction, I believe, or is unwilling as myself, but of others I can safely say that I believe they delighted in it. Their conduct certainly exhibited a most bloodthirsty spirit, but above all others present, and above all human themes I ever saw. I think Saint-Hipolyte was the most diabolical. She engaged in the horrid task with all-illacuity, and assumed from choice the most revolting parts to be performed. She ceased to gag, forced it into the mouth of the poor nun, and when it was fixed between her extended jaws, so as to keep them open at their greatest possible distance, to a cold of the straps fastened at each end of the stick, cross them behind the helpless head of the victim, and drew them tight through the loop prepared in the fascinating. The bed, which had always stood in one part of the room, still remained there, though the screen which had usually been placed before it, and which was made of thick muslin, with only a crevice through which a person behind might look out, had been folded up on its hinges in the form of a W in place in a corner. On the bed the prisoner was laid with her face upward, and then bound with cords so that she could not move. In an instant, another bed was thrown upon her, one of the priest named Bohnen, sprung like a fury first upon it, and stamped upon it with all his force. He was speedily followed by the nuns until there were as many upon the bed as could find room, and all did what they could, not only to smother but to bruise her, some stood up and jumped upon the poor girl with their feet, some with their knees, and others in different ways seemed to see how they might best beat the breath out of her body, and mangled it without coming in direct contact with it, or seeing the effects of their violence. During this time, my feelings were almost too strong to be endured. I felt stupified, and scarcely was conscious of what I did. Still, fear for myself remained in this efficient degree to induce me to some exertion, and I tempted to talk to those who stood next, partly that I might have an excuse returning away from the dreadful scene. After the lapse of 15 or 20 minutes, and when it was presumed that the sufferer had been smothered and crushed to death, father Bohnen and the nuns ceased to trample upon her, and stepped from the bed. All was motionless and silent beneath it. They then began to laugh at such and human thoughts as a curve to some of them, rallying each other in the most unfailing manner, and ridiculing me for the feelings which I in vain endeavored to conceal. They eluded to the resignation of our murdered companion, and one of them tontingly said, she would have made a good Catholic murder. After spending some moments in such conversation, one of them asked if the corpse should be removed. The superior said it had better remain a little while. After waiting a short time longer, the feather bed was taken off, the courts unloosed, and the body taken by the nuns and dragged downstairs. I was informed that it was taken into the cellar and thrown unceremoniously into the hole which I have already described. Covered with a great quantity of lime and afterwards sprinkled with a liquid, of the properties and name of which I am ignorant. This liquid I have seen poured into the hole from large bottles after the next were broken off, and have heard that it is used in France to prevent the Afluvia rising from cemeteries. I did not soon recover from the shock caused by this scene. Indeed, it still repairs to me with most gloomy impressions. The next day there was a melancholy aspect over everything, and recreation time passed in the dullest manner, scarcely anything was set above a whisper. I never heard much said afterward about Saint Francis. I spoke with one of the nuns a few words one day, but we were all cautious not to expose ourselves very far and could not place much reliance in each other. The murdered nun had been brought to her shocking end through the treachery of one of our number in whom she confided. I never knew with certainty who had reported her remarks to the superior, but suspicion fastened on one, and I never could regard her, but with detestation. I was more inclined to blame her than some of those employed in the execution. For there could have been no necessity for the betrayal of her feelings. We all knew how to avoid exposing each other. I was often sent by the superior to over here what was said by novices and nuns. When they seemed to shun her, she would say, go and listen, they are speaking English. And though I obeyed her, I never informed against them. If I wished to clear my conscience, I would go to a priest who can fast, knowing that he dared not communicate what I said to any person, and that he would not impose his heavy penances as the superior. We were always at liberty to choose another confessor when we had any sin to confess, which we were unwilling to tell one, to whom we should otherwise have gone. Not long after the murder just related, a young woman came to the nunnery and asked for permission to see Saint Francis. It was by former friend, with whom I had been as an assistant teacher, Miss Louise Bousquet of Sandanine, from this I suppose the murdered nun might have come from that town or its vicinity. The only answer returned to the inquiry was that Saint Francis was dead. Sometime afterward, some of Saint Francis's friends called to inquire after her, and they were told that she had died a glorious death, and further told that she had made some heavenly expressions which were repeated in order to satisfy her friends.

"Brain and Personality, or the Physical Relations of the Brain to the Mind",William Hanna Thomson,73980,11.0,"February 7, 2021",[],0,"revox.org. Recording by A.B.E. in February 2021. Brain and Personality, or the physical relations of the brain to the mind, by William Hanna Thompson. Chapter 1. Historical Introduction. There is no more interesting subject in science than the physical conditions under which we become thinking beings. Though science is concerned with the knowledge which comes from investigation and experiment in the physical world, yet she can not evade being questioned about the relations of matter to mind, because the bodily organ of the mind is a thing of physics. Hence, however discussion about mind may be waived as pertaining to the province of metaphysics, this cannot be done with that collection of matter which is called the brain. In it, mind and matter come together, and therefore we cannot help asking how much the one is dependent upon the other. As far as the mind is concerned, it must be admitted that no study of its own operations can give the least inkling on this question. Any more than a study of the words of a telegram would reveal how a wire came to conduct them. The passage of thought in the one case, and of words in the other, are equally invisible. But the wire can be followed up until it connects with a mechanism which generates the words for the wire to transmit. Can any analogous result be expected from an examination of the physical mechanism through which the mind acts? The answer is that something of the kind seems to be assured by more than discoveries of different relations between particular portions of brain, brain, matter and thought. That there are certain material seeds of purely mental functions as the brain is now demonstrated beyond mistake by the fact that when these are physically disorganized, their special mental functions are forth with abolished, though all other places in the brain remain intact. It is significant, however, that these discoveries relate in the first instance to the working of the brain of man, in distinction from the brains of animals. Restricted to the brains of animals which they could experiment with, physiologists would have been but little able to determine what special relations the brain helped to thought. If the brain of man it has proved to be wholly different, because unlike animals, man possesses a faculty which is directly related to thought, the great faculty of speech, and the specific anatomical seeds of speech have been found in the human brain as certainly as the ticker is found in its place in a telegraph office. It should be remarked, however, that it was reserved for physicians and not for psychologists to light upon these great discoveries by their observing what may be termed the effects of experiments with the human brain, which disease makes for them. While it has been a distinct gain for psychologists to leave metaphysics and turn their attention to the general physiology of the nervous system, the criticism may be made that apart from the human brain, the field of psychology is very limited as far as the relation of mind to matter is concerned. A single very circumscribed injury to a place in the human brain may teach more on this subject than a survey of the whole domain of nervous physiology in animals. This is well illustrated by the fact that the identification of speech centers in the brain, yearlong led to the discovery, again by medical men, of the material seeds of a whole series of other faculties, both sensory and intellectual, so that taken together these findings give to the subject of the physical relations of the brain to the mind and entirely new aspect. These discoveries, however, have all been made within the lifetime of our own generation. On that account, they are scarcely known to the general public, and they are important bearing on the old question of matter and mind is even less appreciated. Few persons are aware how slow the progress of knowledge has been of the actual physical relations of the mind to the body, and hence in historical review of that progress would seem to be a fitting introduction to our present discussion. Thus, the word brain does not want to occur in the Bible, for the good reason that during the centuries in which its different books were written, scarcely anyone in the world suspected that this most silent and secluded of organs had anything to do with thought or feeling. The earliest identification of the mind with a bodily organ we find among the Babylonians who located it in the liver. They are priests, therefore elaborated a great system of omens based upon the appearances of this organ in the animals offered up for sacrifice. With the Hebrews, on the other hand, the heart was the chief seat of the soul, while the mind was located in the kidneys and all tender emotions in the bowels. Thus, one soul mist says that his reigns, kidneys, instruct him in the right seasons, and another that the Lord triathess the heart and the kidneys. The prophet Jeremiah denounces the hypocrites of his day who had the Lord in their mouths, but not in their kidneys. In keeping with similar expressions in the old testament, Saint Paul speaks of bowels of mercies. A survival of these conceptions is found in our English phrase, two fellows of the same kidney. Nor for a long time were the ideas of the Greeks on this subject much nearer the mark. It is true that Plato assigns the supreme seat of the mind to the brain, but how purely speculative where his views is illustrated by the following quotation. The creation of bones and flesh was in this wise. The foundation of these is the marrow which binds together body and soul, and the marrow is made out of such of the primary triangles as are adapted by their perfection to produce all the four elements. These God took and mingled them in due proportion, making as many kinds of marrow as they were to be here after and kinds of souls. The receptacle of the divine soul he made round and called that portion of the marrow brain, intending that the vessel containing the substance should be the head. The bones were formed by sifting pure earth and wetting it with marrow. It was then thrust alternately into fire and water and thus rendered insoluble by either. As the bone was brittle and liable to modify and destroy the marrow by two great rigidity, he contrived sinews and flesh. The first to give plasticity the second to guard against heat and cold. Having this in view the creator mingled earth with water and mixed with them a ferment with acid and salt, so as to form palpy flesh, etc. It is evident that Plato in this confounded the substance of the brain and of the spinal cord with the marrow of the bones and thus got his conception of marrow as the foundation of the living body. But his younger contemporary Aristotle, Sirka BC335, who was the foremost physiologist of his day and himself, the son of a physician, scouted all this mightle for a go of Plato's. And as Plato evolved it all out of his own head, without troubling himself about facts, he had little difficulty in doing so. Aristotle examined the brain for himself and came to the conclusion that its function had nothing to do with mind, but that it was a cool organ which properly refrigerated the blood for the heart. We made him to smile now at this conclusion, but Aristotle was no mere theorist and he reasoned according to a sound scientific method from facts as he knew them. We must put ourselves in his place, with nothing to go by more than certain patent facts of life, the explanation of which by other facts was then unknown to him. He found the brain and apparently insensible and inexitable organ while the heart was extremely excitable. He therefore only followed his great predecessor Hippocrates, the father of medicine, who, recognizing how quickly consciousness is abolished by loss of blood, or deranged by blood poisons, or by the heated blood of fevers, inferred that the conscious mind resided in the blood and hence that the heart as the central organ of the circulation was itself the chief seat of the soul. Another cause of misunderstanding was that as the arteries are found empty after death, owing to their contractile walls, expelling the blood from them, it was concluded that these vessels carried air or ethereal spirits from the heart to the rest of the body. We shall see that nothing so contributed to delay for centuries all progress as this mistake by suggesting the existence and all pervading power of vital spirits. Supported by such great names as Hippocrates and Aristotle, these beliefs held sway for fully five centuries, along with speculations how from the blood, the different organs of the body, such as the stomach, liver, spleen, intestines, etc., elaborated each its share of the various appetites or emotions. Meanwhile, in this wilderness of Greek speculation, a voice had been crying in vain the true doctrine about the brain, long before Plato or any of the rest. Alchmayan, the Pythagorean of Crotona, who lived about BC500, a man who was both an anatomist and an experimental physiologist, taught that the brain was the soul seat of the mind and the source of feeling and of movement, and that at the brain arrived all sensation by means of the nerves. It is evident that he was led to do this by noting that severing the optic nerves leading from the eyes to the brain produced total blindness. Unfortunately, he called the nerves tendons, a term which, with its erroneous suggestions, continued to be applied to them for two thousand years until finally the great the cult demonstrated the essential difference between tendons and nerves, even Shakespeare when he spoke of nerves meant sin use. But whether from Alchmayan's colonial origin, or because he was far in advance of his time, both Plato and Eris Totel, who must have read his works, alluded to them contemptuously as somebody's views. Eris Totel indeed taught that the spinal cord had nothing in common with the brain and evidently paid little attention to its tendons or nerves. In progress of time, a great school of anatomists and experimental physiologists arose in Alexandria, of whom Herophilis, circa BC 300, and his contemporary eras, districters, were the chief, who carefully dissected the brain and traced to it the nerves of the special senses as Alchmayan had done. They went so far as to demight the nerves introduced of sensation and of motion, though there were still hampered by Alchmayan's term, tendon, and apparently they could not wholly shake off the authority of Eris Totel as to the functions of the brain. They prepared the way, however, for Galen, circa AD 160, to whom we are chiefly indented for the overthrow of Eris Totel's doctrine about the brain and the demonstration of its exclusive title as the seat of thought and feeling. To this great physician belongs the distinction of establishing this doctrine for all time. A contemporary of his aruteus of Capodocia, circa AD 170, advanced so far as to recognize correctly that the brain dominated the muscular movements of the body by nerves, which originating in the brain, crossed their tracks below in the form of the letter X, so that injuries in one hemisphere of the brain paralyzed the muscles of the opposite side of the body. While if they occurred in the spinal cord below the medulla, the resulting paralysis was on the same side with the injury. But even aruteus held that the seat of the soul was in the heart. After Galen, the progress of discovery of the true functions of the brain was extraordinarily slow. From the middle of the second century AD, to the middle of the 19th century, or 1,700 years, the actual gains in the knowledge were relatively most insignificant, compared with the splendid advances in astronomy, geography, physical science, chemistry and geology. It would seem as if to know that, scientifically, rather than metaphysically, instead of being the first was destined to be among the latest of human achievements. One great cause for this backwardness was to persistence way of teleology in all questions about life. Men were ever trying to explain the reasons of things by the imagined purposes of things and to find the causes in the purposes. Thus we have seen that Plato's whole physiology originated in what he fancied the creator and the gods intended when they made this so at that part of the living body. And all the long way down the centuries we meet with examples of reasoning on these subjects, not unlike that of the philosopher, who admired the benevolent wisdom of providence in arranging that large rivers should flow past large towns. One of the greatest of these hindrances was the conception of the brain as a secreting land, which dates from hypocrites and continues down to Karl Fogt, Kabanis and other writers in the early years of the 19th century, who maintained that the brain secreted thought just as the liver secreted smile. Hypocrites writes that the brain resembles a gland being white and soft like glands. It discharges the same glandular offices as regards the head. It reads the head of its humidity and returns to the extremities to surplus of its flux. With this postulate that it is a gland, one authority after another attempted to represent the brain's secretion as a kind of subtle fluid termed animal spirits, which permeated the body through the blood. Thus the count taught that the left ventricle of the heart separated these animal spirits, which had been generated in the brain, and the stilled them out of the blood into a very living and very pure flame, and then distributed them through the arteries. These animal spirits, therefore, were readily made to account for everything, normal and abnormal. Hence it was due to noxious vapours and humerus that every variety of bodily disorder took its rise. To illustrate how effectively such conceptions served to block all progress in the science of life, we make quote one instance from a ponderous volume in my library with the date 1618 on physiology and anatomy by Hildkia Crook, physician and professor on anatomy and carergery to his majesty James I. Speaking of the origin and growth of hair, he says, the immediate matter of the hair is a suety thick and earthy vapor, which in the time of the third concoction, distillation, is elevated by the strength of the action of natural heat, and passes through the pores of the skin, heat-ecciatedth or dryth this moisture of these suety and thick vapours, for the vapor being thick, in his passage, leave it some part of itself to which the grossest in the very outlet, where it is impacted by a succeeding vapor arising where the former did, is protruded and thrust forward so that they are rolled together in one body. The straightness of the passages of the skin were through the matter of the hairs is avoided, form with them into a small roundness, even as a wire receives that proportion where of the whole is, were through it is drawn. One great office of the hairs of the head, therefore, Crook perceived to be to lead off the vapours which otherwise would choke and make smokey the brain. Though how hopelessly choked the brains of all bald heads hence would be, he does not mention. Crook's illustrious contemporary Lord Bacon, held that the blood did not distend the heart, nor caused it to beat, but that was done by its contained spirits. Even Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood did not dislodge these pure non-entities from the brain. For we find as late as 1824, Dr. J. Mason Good in his study of medicine, mentioning the fact that the brain being a gland, the nervous power or energy issues from it as a fluid of a peculiar kind and is so distributed by its nerves. It was the introduction of the microscope into the investigation of nervous tissues which first really exercised the animal spirits from the medical world. Their objective existence, in fact, had often been called in question before, but it was difficult to banish these eerie creations altogether until some solid physical facts could be found which would dispose of them. Without the microscope, we could never have known what every living texture really is, nor after what fashion it is constructed. With the microscope, Ian Berg made in 1833, the first discovery of a nerve cell in a spinal ganglion, and four years later, poor kidney demonstrated that the grey matter of the cerebrum and of the cerebellum is made up of nervous cells and their fibers. This was followed in the next year by the publication of the Great Work of Schleiden and Schwan, in which they proved that all vegetable and animal tissues are made up of cells and the products of cells. The intimate structure of all tissues and organs was thus revealed, and each was found to be perfectly characteristic of its kind, whether boni, tendingous, glandular, muscular, nervous, etc. Nervous tissue, especially is very peculiar and unlike anything else in the body, and least of all, like glandular tissue. The brain, therefore, was thus shown to be no more a gland than a hand or a foot is, and that it never secretes anything. The brain, instead, is a special and distinct organ, connecting with nothing but nerves, acting and acted upon only through nerves or nervous masses, called ganglia, which are distributed through the body. It was not long before this conception of the brain as a separate mechanism in us, constructed after its own pattern, began to give rise to a new batch of theories. The goal, to whom brain anatomy owes a good deal, particularly in the tracing of the course of the brain fibers down through the medulla or blongata, regarding the brain as one organ, conceived that its convolutions served to market off into so many compartments, each with its distinctive mental functions which he proceeded to identify. This made out a list of 24 brain localities, possessed with special intellectual or moral attributes, and which his pupil spook timing, increased to 38. Now, as all individuals have their personal peculiarities of mind and of this position, these, in turn, could be explained by the development of their corresponding convolutions. This amethystation would leave a highly developed mathematical convolution, and a combative man would possess his brain seed of combativeness, etc. This so-called science of frenology had great vogue for a time, owing to its further assumption that the outer contour of the head corresponded to the arrangements of the convolutions within, and thus afforded a ready physical basis for estimating what manner of men or woman each person was. So popular became the supposed scientific standard of individuality that I once heard a prominent clergyman remark that before he addressed a young man about his soul, he wished he could be allowed to feel his bumps. But as in the case of animal spirits, so frenology had to disappear before facts. It was shown that Gaul and his followers did not study a sufficient number of brains, because, on the one hand, the mathematical convolutions were found as largely developed in the brains of popars, dying in hospitals, as in the few mathematicians whose brains Gaul had investigated. While the brains of some imminent men had no specially developed convolutions where they ought to have had them. On the other hand, while the inner table of the skull corresponds in a general way with the sub-adjacent convolutions, it does not keep shape with any special convolution whatever. While as respects the outer table of the skull, there may be no correspondence at all. Franology, therefore, gradually became the exclusive property of popular lecturers who illustrated its doctrines with plates of variously labeled heads. The period between 1845 and 1860 was marked by notable advances, not only in general physiology, but also in the physiology of the brain and of the nervous system. The great principle of reflex action, the deus of the afferent and efferent elements in all nervous processes, was established, and many of the amazingly intricate parts of nerve fibers in the spinal cord and in the brain were traced out. Fran said that time took the lead in all branches of medical science, and the names of Majondi, Longgi, Flouran, Crature Lee, and others like them, will always rank high in the annals of neurology. It is not easy at this day to appreciate whether paramount influence was exerted in the medical world by this school of Paris, whose lecture rooms were crowded by students from all countries. But partly as a reaction from the doctrines of Franology, all separate localization of function in the brain was strongly denied, while the opposite and no less erroneous teaching was promulgated that the brain always acts as a whole. The cerebral convolutions were regarded as the sensorium commune, and as one of them expressed it, any specific vibration initiated in each kind of sensory nerve, thrills throughout the whole or a greater part of the mass of the brain. Thus, medical opinions seemed to settle down to the conclusion that our two brain hemispheres correspond to our two lungs, in the respect that every part discharges the same functions with the rest. But a great change was impending. On April 14, 1861, an eminent French hospital surgeon, Paul Broca, read a paper before the sociated d'antropologie of Paris, in which he adduced evidences to prove that there is a definite locality in the brain, which is the sole seat of articulate speech, found in a limited area in the lower and posterior part of the convolution called the third frontal, and which is now named Broca's convolution. This fact, of course, could only be demonstrated by injuries to that part in the human subject, and Broca showed, by citing a number of post-mortem examinations of persons, dying after paralysis of the right side of the body, usually due to apoplexy, and who was the onset of the paralysis lost the power of utterance, that in all such cases damaged to that locality was demonstrable. As this statement seemed at first to be a reversion to the tenets of frenology, it gave rise to so much heated discussion and denial that it was not until about 1865, that it began to be generally admitted. What chiefly led to its final acceptance was the further discovery that the two other elements of human speech besides articulate utterance also have each their distinct and separate brain localities. One place being found for the words we receive through the ear, damaged to which place causes word deafness, even though there be no deafness to other sounds than words. And secondly, one place for words received through the eye in reading. Damage to which causes the subject at once to become wholly illiterate, though he may see and recognize all other objects of sight, except words, as well as ever. The demonstration of these anatomical bases of the faculty of speech, soon led to careful experimental investigation of the brain in animals for other seats of distinct functions. Constituting what is now termed cerebral localization, and to a comparison of the results achieved with the effects of injury or of disease in the brain of men. By 1870, through the laborers of both experimental physiologists and practicing physicians, such as Hitsik Ferrier, Mung Luchiani, Shako and others, it was shown that each of the special senses has its anatomical seat in the brain, and in addition to that, in a centrally placed zone, are to be found to seats governing the voluntary movements of the muscles of the body, so that each muscle or group of muscles can be made to contract by excitation of the corresponding locality in the cortex or surface of the brain. These discoveries were great enough of themselves, but they are relatively of secondary importance compared with those which followed, and which will cause the name of Poka, as yet scarcely known by the general public, to rank in the history of science, along with the names of Copernicus and of Isaac Newton. The anatomical seats of the senses and those of muscular movements are found equally in both hemispheres of the brain, and their functions, as such, are doubtless congenital. It was thus natural to infer, as the brain is a double organ, like our two eyes and our two ears, each hemispheres being the duplicate of the other, the both brains would equally participate in all brain work. But a most unexpected fact, and one of far-reaching significance, was soon demonstrated, namely that the anatomical seats of the faculty of speech are found only in one of the two hemispheres. Thus, if the Blocca convolution, which is the seat of articulate speech, be damaged in a person after middle life, the loss is usually irremediable, so that he can speak no longer, though the same convolution in the other hemispheres be wholly intact. The same is true as regards word deafness or word blindness from injury of their respective places, for the corresponding localities in the other hemispheres, though not hurt at all, nevertheless are entirely word deaf and word blind, simply because they never had anything to do with speech. But here again, another new element in the problem presented itself, which proved that the endowment of one hemisphear was the great gift of speech, was not owing to any original or special fitness of that hemisphear for such a function, but solely because it was the hemisphear related to the most used hand in childhood. In all right-handed persons, it is in the left brain that the speech centers are located, while in left-handed persons they are found exclusively in the right brain. Two conclusions inevitably follow upon these facts, first that brain matter as such does not originate speech, for then both hemispheres would have their speech centers. And second, that either of the hemispheres is equally good for a speech, if something begins early enough in life to use it for that purpose. That something is the most commonly used hand by the human child at the time when it is learning everything, for self-education always begins in our race with the stretching forth of the hand, as anyone may note in the first purpose of actions of an infant. The hand which it then most used to learn by determined which of its two brain hemispheres should know speech and which hemispheres should remain worthless, and therefore, thoughtless for life. This latter statement that thought as such is a function on the of the hemisphear connected with the faculty of speech was decisively demonstrated by the next revelation which followed upon broadcast fruitful discovery. Without any help from metaphysics and upon a much shorter basis than any metaphysical theories, it was simply found as a physical fact that our mental faculties, as such, are quite distinct from the elementary functions of sensation and of motion. These latter are congenital, but our ability to recognize and therefore to know what the particular object to a meaning's B of what our senses report is not congenital, but as much acquired by us as our speech is acquired and not congenital. Because connected with the original anatomical seats of sight and of hearing were found certain physical anatomical areas of brain matter, injury of which abolished all power to recognize what the ICs or the ear hears. Individual area is a place which, if damaged, renders the person unable to recognize members of his own family, though he see them. And in the auditory area are places, one of which, if hurt, causes the person to be no longer able to know his most familiar tunes when he hears them. While by injury in another spot, he loses all power of distinguishing sounds in general, so that he cannot tell the bark of a dog from the song of a bird, because they are alike only noises to him. And here again, these important brain areas in us, interpreting what sights or sounds mean, are found only in the left hemisphere of the right handed and in the right hemisphere of the left handed. In other words, in the hemisphere in which the seats of the faculty of speech are located. The decisive bearing of these pure matters of fact upon our whole discussion of the physical relations of the brain to the mind and to the personality is plain enough. As none of these wonderful mental faculties, including that of speech, were connected with brain matter at birth, but were created afterwards, it follows that they were created by the individual himself and atomically modifying his own brain. That brain matter did not itself organize these physical areas of mental function, is shown by their entire absence from the convolutions of the worthless hemisphere. As these physical relations of the brain to the mind are to be fully discussed in our succeeding chapters, we could have preferred not to have alluded to them so far in advance, and we have done so now only for this reason. Many persons may imagine that such a theme must involve the discussion of what the mind is, and therefore enter upon the wide domain of metaphysics. We propose to avoid anything of the kind as our subject deals primarily with the thing of physics, namely the brain. But the main facts about the structure and working of the brain are of such recent discovery that they scarcely yet have become generally known, at least in comparison with the latest discoveries in the physical sciences. Regarding however, simply as matters of knowledge, these new additions to our information about the one organ in us which is related to thought can be second to none in interest and importance.

Before I sailed, Tokyo, September 23rd. My new page of life is dawning. A trip beyond the seas, madey can't Kimbatsu. It's not an ordinary event. It is veryly the first event in our family history that I could trace back for six centuries. My today's dream of America, dream of a butterfly sipping on golden dues, was really broken by the artless turup of the hundred sparrows in my garden. True, true, true, true, true, true, bad sparrows. My dream was silly but splendid. Dream is no dream without silliness, which is akin to poetry. If my dream ever comes true. 24th, the Song of Gay Children scattered over the street had subsided. The harvest moon shown like a yellow halo of Nuno-sama. All things in blessed meets Honokuni, the smallest and also, bathed in sweet and spiring beams of beauty. The soft song that is not to be heard but to be felt was in the air. To his crime, I jogged to squander lazily such a gracious graceful hour within doors. I and my maid stroll to the Compita shrine. Her red-stout fingers, like sweet potatoes, didn't appear so bad tonight, for the moon beautified every ugliness. Our emperor should proclaim forbidding woman to be out at any time except under the moonlight. Without beauty, woman is nothing. Faces the whole soul. I prefer death if I'm not given a pair of dark velvety eyes. What a shame even women must grow old. One stupid wrinkle in my face would be enough to stun me. My pride is in my slim fingers of satan skin. I'll carefully clean my rosate fingernails before I'll land in America. Our wooden clog sounded melodious, like a rhythmic prayer onto the sky. Japs fit themselves to play music even with foot gear. Every house with a lantern that its entrance looked to shrine cherishing the thousand idols within. I kneel to the Compita god. I didn't exactly see how to address him being ignorant with sort of god he was. I felt thirsty when I reached home. Before I pulled a bucket from the well, I peeped down into it. The moon beams were beautifully stealing into the waters. My tortoise show combed from my head dropped into the well. The waters from far down smiled, hard to Lee congratulating me on going to America. Twenty-fifths. I sought all day long how I'll look in American dress. Twenty-sixth. My shoes and six pairs of silk stockings arrived. How I hoped they were neat-bone silk. One pair's value is four yen. Extravagants, how dear. I hardly see any bit of reason against bare feet. Well, of course it depends on how they are shaped. A Japanese girl's feet are a sweet little piece. They're flatness and archlessness manifest their pathetic womanliness. Feet tell as much as poems. I have taken the same laborious care with my feet as with my hands. Now they have to retire into the heavy constrained shoes of America. It's not so bad, however, to slip one's feet and to gorgeous silk like that. My shoes are of superiors shape. They have a small high heel. I'm glad they make me much taller. A bamboo I set some three summers ago, cast its unusually melancholy shadow on the round-paper window of my room and whispered, Sada Sada Sada. It sounded to me like a pallet voice of Sionata. By the way, the perfuse tips of my bamboo are like the ostrich plumes of my new American hat. Sionata never sounded before more sad, more thrilling. My goodbye to home-sweet home and the chameleas and white-crascent the mums is within ten days. The steamer Belgic leaves Yoko-Hama on the sixth of next month. My beloved uncle's chaperene during my American journey. Twenty-seventh, I cisored out the pictures from the American magazines. The magazines were all tired looking back numbers. New ones are serviceable in their own home. Forgotten old actors stray into the villages for an glorious tour. So it is with the magazines. Only the useless numbers come to Japan, I presume. The pictures, madey can, is a country of women. That's why I fancy. The pictures are chiefly of women. Showed me how to pick up the long skirt. That one act is the whole business of looking charming on the street. I apprehend that the grace of American ladies is in the serpentine curves of the figure in the narrow waist. Woman is the slave of beauty. I applied my new corset to my body, I pulled it so hard. It pained me. Twenty-eighths, my heart was a lark. I sang, but not in a trembling voice like a lark, some slices of school song. I skipped around my garden, because it occurred to me finally while pure beautiful in my new costume. I smiled happily to the sunlight whose autumn no yellow flakes. How yellow they were, fell upon my arm stretched to pluck a crescent of them. I admit that my arm is brown, but it's shapely. Twenty-ninth, English of America, sir, it is light, unreserved, and accessible. Guru Deer again. My love of it returned like the glow in a brazier that I had watched passionately, then left all the summer days, and to which I turned my apologetic face with winter's approaching steps. Oh, yeah, my book of long-thalough under the heavy coat of dust. I dusted the book with care and veneration as I did a wee image of the Lord a month ago. The same old gentle face of American poet, a poet need not always to sing, I assure you, of tragic lamentation and of far beyond, stared at me from its frontest piece. I wondered if he ever dreamed his volume would be open on the tiny brown palms of his Japan girl. A certain fancy came to me as if he, the spirit of his picture, flung his critical impressive eyes at my elaborate cue with coral-headed pin, or upon my face. Am I not a lovely young lady? I had thrown long-thalough many months ago on the top shelf where a grave spider was in camping, and given every liberty to that resident, studious, silver-haired gentleman Mr. Moth to tramper around the arcadey. Mr. Moth ran out without giving his own honorable impression of the popular poet, when I let the pages flutter. Large fatherly poet he is, but not unique. Uniqueness, however, has become commonplace. Poet of plain plainness is he, plainness and thought and color, even his elegance is plain enough. I must read Mr. Longfellow again as I used a year ago reclining in the spring breeze, a song of life, the village blacksmith, and half a dozen snatches from Evangeline or the song of Hayawatha at the least. That is not because I am his devotee. I confess the poet of my taste, isn't he, but only because he is a great idol of American ladies as I am often told, and I may suffer the accusations of idiocy in America, if I be not charming enough to quote lines from his work. 30. Many a year I have prayed for something more decent than a marriage offer. I wonder if the generous destiny that all condemn me to the illustrious country of woman first, isn't the something. I am pleased to sail for a Marriquie, being a woman. Shall I have to become naturalized in America? The Japanese gentleman who desires the old barbarity, persists still infancy, that girls are trading wears. When he shall come to understand what is love. Fy on him, I never felt more insulted than when I was asked and emerged by one unknown to me. No oriental man is qualified for civilization, I declare, educate man, but beg your pardon, not the woman. Modern girls born in the enlightened period of magia are endowed with quite a remarkable soul. I act as I choose, I have not to wait for my mom as approval to laugh when I inclined to. October 1st, I stole into the looking glass, woman loses almost her delight in life, if without it, for the last glimpse of my hair in Japan style. But if I'm owed, I'll miss it to dawning my small head while I'm away from home. I have often thought that Japanese display oriental rhetoric, only a press of rhetoric that pulls these the spirit, and hairdressing. It's beauty is intonemation. I longed for another new attraction on my head. I felt sad, however, when I could off all the paper cords from my hair. I dreaded that the American method of dressing the hair might change my head into an absurd little thing. I lent the hair languished over my shoulders. I laid me down on the bamboo porch in the pens of shape of a mermaid fresh from the sea. The sport of breezes fraulect with my hair. They must be mischievous boys of the air. I thought the reason why American coifers seemed savage and without art, was mainly because it prized more of natural beauty. Naturalness is the highest of all beauties. Siyoshikaraba, let me learn the beauty of American freedom, starting with my hair. Are you sure it's not sloth on me, Ness? Woman's lovin'liness is only forgiven where no gentleman is born. Second, occasional forgetfulness I venture to say is one of woman's charms. But I fear too many lapses in my case filled a background. I am used myself sometimes fancing with our shelf or get my husband's name, if I ever have one. How shall I manage shell and will? My memory of it is faded. I search for a printed slip. How to use shell and will? I pressed explore even the pantry after it. Afterwards, I recalled that Professor Assorted that Americans were not precise in grammar. The affirmation of any professors and weighty enough, but my restlessness was cured somehow. This must be the age of job girls, I ejaculated. I was reading a paper on our bamboo land, penned by Mr. Somebody. The style was inferior to Irvings. I have read his gratifying sketchbook. I used to sleep holding it under my wooden pillow. Woman feels happy to stretch her hand even in dream and touch something that belongs to herself. Sketchbook was my child for many, many months. Mr. Somebody has lavished adoring words of my sisters. I diguddle. Thank heavens. If he didn't declare, however, that no sensible Muslim will prefer a foreign Raymond to her kimono. He failed to make me a completely happy nightingale. Shall I meet the Americans in our flat in gown? I imagined myself hitting off a tune of Karangkoro with clogs and circumspect steps along fifth avenue of somewhere. The throngs swarmed around me. They tugged my silk and sleeves, which almost swept the ground and inquired. How much a yard? Then they implored me to sing some Japanese diddy. I'll not play any sensational role for any price. Let me remain a home we last, though I expressed no craft and medican dress. Do I look shocking in a corset? In picking, you have to speak making a haira. Is my belief. Third, my hand had sold them lifted anything wadier than a comb to adjust my haira flowing down my neck. The silver knife, large and sharp enough to fight the Russians, dropped in cracked a bit of the rim of the big plate. My hand tired. My uncle and I were seated at a round table and celebrated American restaurant, the Western Sea House. It was my first occasion to face an orderly heavy medic in Tabla do Te. It's fertile taste was oily, the oppressive smell of medic. Must I make friends with it? I am afraid my small stomach is only fitted for a bowl of rice and a few cuts of raw fish. There's nothing more light, more inviting than Japanese fare. It is like a sweet summer villa with many sliding shows you from which you smile into the breeze and sing to the stars. Lightness is my choice. When I wondered, could I feel at home with American food? My uncle is a medican too. He promised to show me a heap of things in America. He is an 1884 Yale graduate. He occupies the marked seat of the chief secretary of the Nippon mining company. He has procured leave for one year. What were the questionable looking fragments on the plate? Pieces with pock marks. Cheese was their honorable name. My uncle scared me by saying that some charming worms resided in them. Poop, poof. They emitted an annoying smell. You have to empty the choices to box of tooth powder after even this lightest intercourse with them. I dare not to make their appointance. No, not for a thousand dyes. I took a few of them in my pocket paper as merely as a curiosity. Shall I hang them on the door so that the pest may not conneuter our house? Even the pest will stay away from it, you see. Fourth, the bellgic makes one day's delay. She will leave on the seventh. Why not one week, I cried. I pray that I may sleep a few nights longer in my home. I grow sadder, thinking of my departure. My mother shouldn't come to the medican warf. Her tears may easily stop my American adventure. I and my maid went to our Buddhist monastery. I offered my good buy to the graves of my grandparents. I decked them with elegant bunches of croissants and mums. When we turned our steps homeward, the snowy I route a monk. How unearthly he appeared. begged me not to forget my family's church while I'm in America. Christians are barbarians. They eat beef at funerals. He said. His voice was like a chant. The wind's brought a gush of melancholy evening prayer from the temple. The tolling of the monastery bell was tragic. 5th, a chinkworo barked after me. The Japanese little doggy doesn't know better. He has to encounter many strange things. The tap of my shoes was a thrill to him. The rustling of my silk skirt, such a volatile sound, sounded an alarm to him. I was hurring along the road home from uncles in medican dress. What a new delight I felt to catch the peeping tips of my shoes from under the trailing kushegoro mou. I forced my skirt to wave, coveting a more satisfactory glance. Did I look as a suspicious character? I was glad. It amused me to think the dog regarded me as a foreign girl. Oh, how I wish to change me into a different style, changes so pleasing. My imitation was clever. It succeeded. When I entered my house, my maid was dismayed and said, be couldestall. You terrified me. I took you for an easy and from medican country. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I passed gracefully like a princess making her triumphant exit in the 5th act into my chamber, leaving behind my happiest laughter and shut myself up. I confessed that I earned the most delicious moment I have had for a long time. I cannot surrender under the accusation that japs are only imitators, but I admit that we need bone daughters are suited to be mimics. And why not gift it in the adroit art? Where's Mr. Somebody who made himself useful to warn the muslims? Then I began to rehearse the scene of my first interview with a white lady at San Francisco. I opened Bartlett's English Conversation book, an examined to see if what I spoke was correct. I sat on the writing table, Japanese houses set no chairs, goodness, mutai-nai. I sat on the great book of Confucius. The mirror opposite me showed that I was a little dear, sixth, it rained, soft, woolen, autumn rain like a gossamer. It's suggestive sound as a far away song which is half-saub, half-oader. I slid open a paper door. My house sits on the hill, commanding a view over half Tokyo and the bay of Yeto. My darling city, with a maternal TN cake, with the lanterns of festival, looked up to me through the grave ale of rain. I felt as if Tokyo were bidding me farewell.

Mozart's Youth,Franz  Hoffmann,44787,,"June 2, 2021",[],0,"g. Recording by Larry Wilson. Mozart's youth by France Hupman translated by George P. Upton. Preface. The live story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart contained in this volume closes with his admission to membership in the Academy of Philharmonica at Bologna Italy. Mozart was then in his 15th year. Up to that time, his life had been a happy one, free from care, untouched by adversity, and crowned with continuous successes. He was admired by the people, considered a prodigy by the greatest composers, and was received with extraordinary honors at the courts of Austria, France, Holland and England. His 20 remaining years, in bidder by Inmedis and Sadden by Privations and Miss Fortune's, find no place in this life story. They were occupied almost exclusively with artistic tours during which he brought out many of his greatest works. Among them, Mitradate, Idomanel, Mary Jephiguro, Don Giovanni, and The Magic Flute. The last name Bopro made its appearance in 1789, the same year he began the immortal Requiem. The composition of which was so significant in his relation to his rapidly approaching end. He died two years later. He was then in empowers circumstances. His funeral was the kind common among the poor's class. No note of music was heard. Though friend accompanied the solitary herst to the cemetery where this great genius was left in a popper's grave. His life story in this volume leaves him crowned with honors. They idle of his time. A marvel to the greatest musicians, flushed with success, and exultant in the pride of genius. The night of the threshold of youthful manhood, the brightest most beautiful, most attractive, most lovable figure in the world of music. It is one of the attractions of this little volume that it takes leave of him there before the sunshine of his life was obscured by a single cloud. G. P. U. Chicago, 1914.

The Art of Conversation: Twelve Golden Rules,Josephine Turck Baker,31495,6.0,"July 4, 2021",[],0,"formation or to volunteer, please visit LibraVox.org. He read by Kevin S. She read by Devora Allen. Golden Rule Number 1. Avoid unnecessary details. You know that what you say always interests me. That is because we are such good comrades. Not altogether, I think that it is because you never dwell upon details. Then one is interesting in conversation, according as one omits details. A necessary details. I remember that when visiting some friends whom I had not seen for several years, my host is said to me, ever since you were arrival I have been trying to discover why you are so interesting in conversation. And I have decided that it is because you omit unnecessary details. I felt that my hostess had paid me a high compliment. Yes, but one that you deserve. Now even until this incident you were correct, the board would have side tracked and would have told a normal and irrelevant details. I don't believe you could bore a person if you were to try. I am quite sure that I could. Listen to this. Several years ago, four years ago, just this last June, no, it was only three years ago, because I remember now that four years ago I did not attend the Alumni Reunion of our college. And so it must have been three years ago. I was the guest of one of the members of my class. I was attending the annual reunion of the Alumni of our college. Almost every year I attend the Alumni Reunion of our college. And on this occasion I was the guest of one of the members of my class. She had not been attending the reunions until I had not seen her for several years, five years at least, and part my interruption but you are a success. As a poor. No, as an imitator, I think that you should have been an actress. Yes, I think that nature intended me for one, and I could have acted. Indeed, I usually find it difficult not to act. That is, I find it difficult to be myself. Like sensational Tommy and Tommy and Grisel. Yes, in a way. And why were you not an actress? Was it because you did not know that you had talent? From an opposite reason. I had so many talents that like the woman in Mother Doos I hardly knew what to do. That sounds modest. You probably would have been a great actress. I might not have been. Sometimes you know persons who are very gifted seem to miss the best that life has to offer. I've decided that you are interesting not because you do not side track, but because you have such a dependous amount of conceit, you seem to be fully aware of what you possess. It is delightful. My talent or my conceit. Both. I am sure that if anyone else possessed my talent, I should not hesitate to speak of them. Why should I not speak of mine? That is one way to look at it. Now I suppose of our to tell you that you were very gifted, you would say thank you. I think that I am too, or words to that effect. Yes, I think that I should respond in some such way. Why should I not? Why shouldn't I recognize my gifts and be thankful for them? Well, usually, you know, when anyone receives a compliment, he is after regarded as flattery and to treat it accordingly, or if he thinks the praise is maridant, his words are up to blie his thoughts. Yes, but that Brooks had insincerity. However, we are a long way from our subject. We were wondering why some persons bore and why some do not. We decided that one must under no circumstances enter into too many details. The Arunas, if a person is very polite, he will find an interest that he does not feel. Often however, he portrays by an absent expression that the details have done their deadly work. You always seem interested, I notice, even when the narrator is wandered from the main road into innumerable bypass. I appear interested because I am interested. Frime continually on the alert to find out just how he is going to get back to the main road. I find, however, that in the majority of cases, he never gets back. He is lost in such a labron that, as compared with it, the garden of Versailles and the maze of Hampton Court are as not. And just as these world-famed networks have a kind of attraction for the curious, so I find it interesting to follow the bore as he goes from one intricate passage into another, in his endeavor to find an exit. But I must leave him to his fate, or I too shall be lost in the maze, and not be able to find the main path. Then, golden rule number one is avoid unnecessary details. I shall try to remember the rule and profit by its significance.

"Meteorology, On the Universe & On Breath",Aristotle,41104,3.0,"November 15, 2022",[],0,"d the first causes of nature and all natural motion. Also, the stars ordered in the motion of the heavens, and the physical elements, enumerating and specifying them, and showing how they change into one another, and becoming and perishing in general. There are means for consideration a part of this inquiry, which all our predecessors called meteorology. Order is less perfect than that of the first of the elements of bodies. They take place in the region nearest to the motion of the stars. Such are the Milky Way, and comments, and the movements of meteors. And studies also, all the affections we make call common to air and water, into the kinds and parts of the earth, into the affections of its parts. These throw light on the causes of winds and earthquakes, and all the consequences, the motions of these kinds and parts involve. Of these things, some puzzle us, while others admit of explanation in some degree. Further, the inquiry is concerned with the falling of thunderbolts, and with whirlwinds and fire winds. Then further, the recurrent affections produced in the same bodies by conquestion. When the inquiry into these matters is concluded, let us consider what account we can give, in accordance with the method we have followed, of animals and plants, both generally and in detail. When that has been done, we may see that the whole of our original undertaking will have been carried out. After this introduction, let us begin by discussing our immediate subject. Two. We have already laid down that there is one physical element, which makes up the system of the bodies that move in a circle, in the science-nance, four bodies, owing their existence to the four principles. The motion of these latter bodies being of two kinds, either from the center or to the center. These four bodies are fire, air, water, earth. Air occupies the highest place among them all, earth the lowest, and two elements correspond to these in their relation to one another, air being nearest to fire. Water to earth. The whole world surrounding the earth, then, the affections of which our subject is made up of these bodies. This world, necessarily has a certain continuity with the upper motions. Consequently, all its power and order is derived from them. Four. The originating principle of all motion, yes, the first cause. Besides, that element is eternal, and its motion has no limit in space, but is always compliant. Whereas, all these other bodies have separate regions, which limit one another. So, we must treat fire and earth, and the elements like them, yes, the material causes of the events in this world. Meaning, my material, what is subject, and is affectant. But, must assign causality in the sense of the originating principle of motion to the influence of the eternally moving bodies. Three. Let us first recall our original principles, and the distinctions already drawn, and then explain the Milky Way, and to comments, and the other phenomena akin to the ends. Fire. Air. Water. Earth. We assert, originate from one another, and each of them exists potentially in each. As all things do, that can be resolved into a common and ultimate substrined. The first difficulty is reused by what is called the air. What are we to take its nature to be in the world surrounding the earth? And what is its position relatively to the other physical elements? For there is no question as to the relation of the bulk of the earth to the size of the bodies which exist around it. Since astronomical demonstrations have, by this time, proved to us, that it is actually far smaller than some individual stars. As, for the water, it is not observed to exist collectively and separately. Nor can it do so apart from that volume of it, which has its seat about the earth. The sea, that is, and rivers, which we can see, and any subterranean water that may be hidden from our observation. The question is really about the ant which lies between the earth and the nearest stars. Are we to consider it to be one kind of body, or more than one? And if more than one, how many are there, and what are the bounds of their regions? We have already described and characterized the first element, and explained that the whole world of the upper motions is full of that body. This is an opinion we are not alone in holding. It appears to be an old assumption, and one which men have held in the past. Form, the word, ether, has long been used to denote that element. An exaggress, it is true, seems to me to think that the word means the same as fire. For he thought that the upper regions were full of fire, and that men referred to those regions when they spoke of ether. In the latter point, he was right. For men seemed to have assumed that a body that was eternally in motion was also divine in nature. And, as such a body was different from any of the terrestrial elements, they determined to call it ether. For, the same opinion, superior in cycles among men, not once, nor twice, but infinitely often. Now, there are some who maintain that not only the body's emotion, but that which contains them is purifier. Into the interval between the earth and the stars, air. But if they hand it, considerant, what is now, as had is factually established by mathematics. They might have given up this pure-style opinion. For his altogether childish to suppose that the moving bodies are all of them of a small size, because they seem so, to us, looking at them from the earth. This is a matter which we have already discussed in our treatment of the upper region, but we may return to the point now. If the intervals were full of fire, into the bodies consisted of fire, every one of the other elements would long ago have vanished. However, they cannot simply be said to be full of air either. For even if there were two elements to fill the space between the earth and the heavens, the air would far exceed the quantity required to maintain its proper proportion to the other elements. For, the bulk of the earth, which includes the whole volume of water, is infinitesimal in comparison with the whole world that surrounds it. Now, we find that the excess in volume is not proportionately green, where water dissolves into air, or air into fire. Whereas the proportion between any given small quantity of water and the air that is generated from it, ought to hold good between the total amount of air and the total amount of water. Nor does it make any difference if anyone denies that the elements originate from one another, but asserts that they are equal in power. From this view, it is certain amounts of each that are equal in power. Just as it would be the case if they actually originated from one another. So it is clear that neither air nor fire alone fills the intermediate space. It remains to explain after a preliminary discussion of difficult times, the relation of the two elements, air and fire to the position of the first element, and the reason why the stars in the upper region impart heat to the earth, and its neighborhood. Let us first treat of the air as we proposed, and then go on to these questions. Once water is generated from air, and air from water, wire clouds not formed in the upper air. They ought to form there the more. The further from the earth into the colder that region is. For its neither appreciably near to the heat of the stars, nor to the rays reflected from the earth. It is near that dissolve any formation by their heat, and so prevent clouds from forming near the earth. For clouds gather, and to the point where the reflected rays disperse in the infinity of space and our lost. To explain this, we must suppose either that it is not all air from which water is generated, or if it is produced from all air aligned. Then, what immediately surrounds the earth is not near air. But a sort of vapor, and that its vaporous nature, as the reason, why it condenses back to water again. But if the home of that vast region is vapor, the amount of air, and of water will be disproportionately cramed. For the space zones left by the heavenly bodies, must be filled by some element. This cannot be fire, for then all the rest would have been dried up. Consequently, what fills it must be air into the water that surrounds the whole earth. Vapor, being water dissolved. After this exposition of the difficulties involved, let us go on to lay down the truth, with a view at once to what follows, and to what has already been sand. The upper region, as far as the moon, we affirm to consist of a body distinct to both from fire and from air. But varying in degree of purity and in kind, especially towards its limit on the side of the air, and of the world surrounding the earth. Now, the circular motion of the first element, and of the bodies, it contains dissolves, and in flames by its motion, whatever part of the lower world is nearest to it. And so, generates heat. From another point of view, we may look at the motion as follows. The body that lies below the circular motion of the heavens is in a sort of matter, and is potentially haunt, cold, dry, moist, and possessed of whatever other qualities are derived from these. But, it actually acquires or retains one of these in virtue of motion or rest. The cause and principle of which has already been explained. So, at the center and around it we get earth and water, the heaviest and coldest elements by themselves. And, in the end, we can take you with them, air, and what we commonly call fire. It is not really fire, for fire is in excess of heat and a sort of abolition. But in reality, of what we call air, the part surrounding the earth is moist and warm, because it contains both vapor and dry exhalation from the earth. But the next part, above that, is warm and dry. For vapor is naturally moist and cold. But the exhalation, warm and dry. And vapor is potentially like water. The exhalation, potentially like fire. So, we must take the reason why clients are not formed in the upper region to be this. That it is filled not with mere air, but rather with a sort of fire. However, it to me, well-being, that the formation of clowns in that upper region is also prevented by the circular motion. For the air, round the earth is necessarily all of its in motion, except the hand, which is cut off inside the circumference, which makes the earth a complete sphere. In the case of winds, it is actually observable that the originate in marshy districts of the earth, and they do not seem to blow above the level of the highest mountains. It is the revolution of the heaven, which carries the air with it, and causes its circular motion. Fire, being continuous with the upper element and air with fire. Thus, its motion is a second reason why that air is not condensed into water. But, whenever a particle of air grows heavy, the warmth in it is squeezed out into the upper region and it thinks, and other particles in turn are carried up together with the firing exhalation. Thus, the one region is always full of air, and the other of fire, and each of them is perpetually in a state of change. So much, to explain why clouds are not formed, and why the air is not condensed into water, and what account must be given of the space between the stars, and the earth, and what is the body that fills in. As for the heat derived from the sun, the right place for a special and scientific account of it, is in the treatise about sense, since hint is an affection of sense. But, we may now explain how it can be produced by the heavenly bodies which are not themselves, hint. We see that motion is able to dissolve and inflame the air. Indeed, moving bodies are often actually found to melt. Now, the sun's motion alone is sufficient to account for the origin of terrestrial warmth and heat. For more, the motion that is to have this effect must be rapid and near, and the amount of the stars is rapid, but distant. While the amount of the moon is near, but slow. Whereas the sun's motion combines both conditions in a sufficient degree. As that most hint should be generated, where the sun is present is easy to understand, if we consider the analogy of terrestrial phenomena. For here, too, it is the air that is nearest to a thing in rapid motion, which is heat-end most. This is just what we should expect. And, it is the nearest air that is most dissolved by the motion of a sun-end body. This then is one reason why heat reaches our world. Another is that the fire surrounding the air is often scattered by the motion of the heavens, and it driven downwards in spite of itself. Shooting stars further suffice to prove that the celestial sphere is not hot or fiery. For they do not occur in that of a region but below. The more, and the faster a thing moves, the more apt it is to take fire. Assigns, the sun, which most of all the stars is considered to be hot, is really white, and not fiery in color.

The Magic of the Horse-Shoe,Robert Means  Lawrence,64048,1.0,"November 6, 2022",[],0,"it Librebox.org. The Magic of the Horseshoe by Robert Meens Lawrence. The study of the origin and history of popular customs and beliefs, affords an insight, otherwise unattainable, into the operations of the human mind in early times. Superstitions, however trivial in themselves, relics of paganism, though they be, and oftentimes comparable to painful weeds are now considered proper subjects for scientific research. While the ignorant savage is a slave to many superstitious fancies which dominate his every action, the educated man strives to be free from such a bondage. Yet recognizes as profitable the study of those same beliefs. The heterogeneous character of the material drawn from so many sources has rendered it difficult, if not impossible, to follow any distinctly systematic treatment of the subject. However, the development and recent years of a widespread interest in all branches of folklore warrants the hope that any volume devoted to this subject and representing somewhat diligent research may have a certain value in spite of its imperfections. The expert folklore is may find much to criticize, but this book, treating of popular beliefs, is intended for popular reading. It has been the writer's aim to make the chapter on the horseshoe as exhaustive as possible, as this attractive symbol of superstition does not appear to have received hitherto the attention which it merits. This chapter is the outgrowth of a paper read at the seventh annual meeting of the American Folklore Society.

Preface by Francis James Child. These sonnets furnish us with a circumstantial and very interesting history as Spencer's second courtship, which after many repulses was successfully terminated by the marriage celebrated in the Epithalamian. As these poems were entered in the stationers' register on 19 November 1594, we may infer that they cover a period of time extending from the end of 1592 to the summer of 1594. It is possible however that these last dates may be a year too late and that Spencer was married in 1593. We cannot be sure of the year, but we know from the 266th verse of the Epithalamian that the day was the feast of St. Barnumus, June 11th of the old style. In the 74th sonnet we are directly told that the lady's name was Elizabeth. In the 61st she is said to be of the brunt of angels heavenly born. On this and many similar expressions interpreted by the laws of anagram and taken in conjunction with various circumstances which do not require to be stated here, it may be inferred that her name was Negel.

Yorkshire Battles,Edward Lamplough,30848,1.0,"November 19, 2022",[],0,"ox.org. Read by Light Crystal. Yorkshire battles by Edward Lamplow. Preface. In the history of our national evolution, Yorkshire occupies a most important position, and the sangunary record of Yorkshire battles possesses something more than material for the poet and the artist. Valla, loyalty, patriotism, honour, and self-sacrifice, are virtues not uncommon to the warrior, and the blood of true and brave men has liberally bejewed outfields. It was on Yorkshire soil that the tides of foreign invasion were rolled back in blood at Stanford Bridge and North Alitan. The misfortune attendant upon the reign of weakening capable princes are illustrated by the field of Borrowbridge, Bylandabbey, and mighten upon Swail, and in the first days of our Greatest National struggle, the true men of Yorkshire freely shed their blood at Tadcaster Bradford Leeds, Wakefield, Adwaltamore and Hall, keeping open the pathway by which Fairfax passed from Selby to Mastonmore. Let Pettons pray to wars of Kaitoncros, we take national life as a unity, and dare to face this evolution through all the throws of birth, owning ourselves debtors to the old times before us, without being either so-and-wise or ungenerous as to contem the bonds of association, and affect a false and impossible isolation. To the educated and intelligent, our Yorkshire battles present interesting and important studies of those subtle and natural processes by which nations achieve liberty, prosperity, and greatness.

The Pagan's Cup,Fergus Hume,43016,3.0,"November 14, 2022",[],0,"visit Libre-Wax.org. Read by your Gannon. The Pagan's Cup, Chapter 1, a modern Arcadia. Certain portions of England yet remain undiscovered by Americans and uncivilized with railways. Colors to village, about King's medals, in a county which need not be named is one of these unknown spots. Not all before long, the bicycle and the motor car will end live in its somnalent neighbourhood, but at present it is free from the summerjorns of tourists. With this neglect, the call is to forp profess themselves satisfied. They have no wish to come into contact with the busy world. This prejudice against intrusion dates from medieval times, who and strangers rarely came to the village with peaceful intentions. Every now a chance come our, is looked upon with suspicion. Mr Richard Pratt shared something of disorder to the wickard during a morning ramble some six weeks after he had taken up his residence in the Nonshuis. With the partisan and the gentry of the parish, Mr Pratt agreed very well, his respectability having been vouched for by Mrs. Gabriel, the lady of the manna. Pratt, the villagers still held a loaf, although the newcomer did his best to overcome their childish doubts. They did not credit his story that he had settled in Colors' tour to pass his remaining years and peace, and even the money is scattered so freely, could not buy their loyalty. Pratt had never met with such people before. In most countries, an open-parts invites an open heart, but Colors' privileges were a bow-maman worship. Pratt and experience was refreshing to Pratt and introduced him to a new type of humanity. The first place I was struck in which the dollar is not all powerful, he said with his Yankee twang and pleasant love. We are not sufficiently educated in that respect, replied Mr Tempest in a simple way, for my part, and not ill-placed that my parish nurse should refuse to worship the golden cough. There is no cough about me, I guess, said Pratt grimly, and very little gold. I don't say I haven't had decent income, but as to be a milliner, no sir. In the kingdom of the blind that one night is king Mr Pratt, you are a milliner in this poor place, but I feel you find it dull. Why no vicar, I'm glad to be out of the bus. The girls made up their nerves in the missionary nowadays. At 52 years of rage I can't stand the racket. The sleepy halls could enough for me to stay in until that pegalt. Yes, I'll buy an allotment and that grey we are of yours. Hollow said the vicar smiling, and our earthly dwelling place is set upon a hill. Mr Pratt, I suspect to have Irish blood in your veins. Pratt laughed, and being a large extent de-word of humour explained honestly that he had used the word figuratively, Washington Irving, Brip Bandbinkle explained morning, where at the vicar smiled again. The situation of colisterm is striking in strange. A green cloth promoter extended abruptly from the high table land into king's metal. To write and left, chalky cliffs of constribulite flared away from miles, forming a butters to the moots above and walls to the plains below. In prehistoric ages the ocean waves had been against these cliffs, but gradually receding, had left dry the miles upon miles of fertile lands, no cold king's metals. In the upenage of the crown, there had been colesso from the days of Vilinder Kornkora. From where this took, the vicar and his friend had a bird's eye view of this desirable land, unroll like a map under the bright chune sky. League after League of Cornfield stretched away to the clear shining line of ocean. And amidst the ripening grain, appeared red roof villages, clumps of trees, the straight lines of dusty white roads and the winding blittering serpent of the river. And as a background to this smiling plenty, if so Irish and expression be permitted, was a blue experience of the channel dotted with the white sales of merchant men. A small wood-of-ish in-dorks shut off the purple-clad move from this per upon which colisterm was built. And the verge of this, yet encircled by trees, stood the village church, a crusading chapel dedicated to same Gabriel the messenger. Hence the ground fell away gradually and spread out into a broad neck of land down the center of which ran a road leading from chapel to village. An either side of this amatched oaks and elums and psychomotes where the houses of the gentry. From where the ended, the promoter arose into two rounded hills with a slight depression between. On the one to the left the village was built, its houses cramped with an attumbled-down wall dating from the days when it was needed as a defense. The other hill was cemented by a well-preserved castle, the keeper of which with its flag could be seen above the oaks. This was inhabited by Mrs. Gabriel, the sole representative of the feudal lots of colisterm. Yet she was one of the the childless widow of the last baron and a none of the feared Gabriel blood in a veins. The once powerful and prolific family was extinct. Some castle and village steps led out into the depression between the two hills. Down this, continue the chapel road, sloping gradually with many windings to the plains below. The whole place had the look of some renege, robber hold. And if tradition was to be trusted, the Gabriel lords at dwelt like eagles in the airy, swapping down it into wells to harian plunder, burn and slay the peaceful folk of the plains. A turbulent, agressive race the Gabriel's. He had defied king in priest and parliament and people. Time alone had ever conquered it. A survival of the Middle Ages, said Mr. Tempest, pointing out these things to his companion. It was needful that the Gabriel baron should build strong defenses. There were fears in blood thirsty, defiant of law and order. For many centuries they were escours to the inhabitants of the plains. These often complained to the king. And several times the place was besieged, but without result. The Gabriel skipped a hold of it. The only thing they ever lost was the title. A bell of a tinder was passed against them in the time of the second judge. After that they became less lions than forces. Just so, said Mr. Pratt. This place couldn't do much against artillery, I guess. And even the bow narrow days, a strong force coming over more and down the spur. That was often tried in for up to 10th and quickly. But the attempt always failed. In the days of Henry II, ailema Gabriel beat back an overwhelming force and then erected the chapel as a Thanksgiving. The archangel Gabriel was the patron saint of the family and the chapel is dedicated to him. He couldn't keep the family from playing out however, said Pratt as a move towards the village. Now, with the late John Gabriel the family became extinct. But I dare say Mr. Gabriel arranged that an adopted son succase. He can take the name and the court of arms. I should be pleased to see that. Added the vicar half-tensor. Leo is a good fellow and would make an excellent landlord. The eyes of the American flash when the name was mentioned, but he made only a careless commitment. Leo havel a, he said after the pause. He's a right smart young chap, sure. Oh, easy. The son of Mrs. Gabriel's brother. She was a mishevel a, you know. I believe a brother was somewhat dissipated and died abroad. The boy arrived here when he was three years of age and Mrs. Gabriel adopted him. He will be her heir. Is there anyone to object? Ask Pratt eagerly. The vicar shook his head. The Gabriel's are absolutely extinct. Failing Leo, the estate would last to the crown. In the old days, they would have been seized by the king in any case, as his sovereigns were always anxious to hold this point of vantage, which dominated their lands below. But we live in such lawbearing times that Mrs. Gabriel, all the north of the blood of the family, can leave estate to home serve her, she will. I understand that she has quite decided Leo shall inherit and take the name. Also the court of worms. She doesn't strike me as all four of the boys, if Pratt, as they claim the crooked street. Rather a hard woman, I should say. Mrs. Gabriel has particularly high moral standard, reply the vicar evasively, and she wishes to all to obtain to it. Leo, he is a titan. His new words and a boy ought to be, shed the American cheerily. Your young saint makes an old sinner. That's your vicar. Mr. Tempest laughed outright. I fear there is small chance of Leo becoming a saint either young or old, aset. Though he is a good lad in many ways, wild, I admit, but his heart is in the right place. Pratt's mild to him, the new that Leo was in love with Cybil, the daughter of this prosi-old archaeologist. Simple as Mr. Tempest was, he could not be blind to the possibility of his daughter making such an excellent match. Oh yes, love Pratt knowingly. I'm sure his heart is in the right place. But by this time the vicar was in his hobby horse and did not gauge the significance of the speech. Here he said, waving his hand towards the foresight of the square in which they stood, the Romans built a camp. It crowned this hill and was garisoned by the tenth legion, to over all the turbulent tribes swarming on the plains below. In fact, this town is built within the camp as a name shows. How does it show that? Ask Pratt, more to give the vicar talking than because he cared. The name man, the name, it's probably called sister, but by usage, has been shortened to colesta. Call comes from Latin, colonial, a colony, and cast a sister as derived from castra, a camp. Consister, therefore, means the camp colony, which proves that the original builders of this town erected their dwellings within the circumvallation of the original castra of Plorian. If you will come with me Mr Pratt, I will show you the remains of this great work. I've seen it several times before, replied Pratt, rather bored by this archaeological disquisition. I know every inch of this place, it hasn't taken a American sense race to get round, and six weeks of walking have fixed me up in your local geography. But there's a chapel vicar, we might walk up there. I'd like to hear a few remarks on the subject of the chapel, interesting, oh, I guess, shall. Shadly, certainly, set tempest, absolutely. That is walk, walk, and it's trolled away with his hands and his tailcoat pockets. Looking something like an elderly jack-toe. Indeed the church man, with his lean oval face, his large spectacles, and the fluttering black comments on his tinge figure, very much resembled a pack. He was scholarly, well-bred, and gentle, but wholly unworldly. Since his wife had died seven years before, civil had taken charge of the house. Harald Raston, the energetic curat, looked after the parish. But for these two, both clerical and domestic affairs would have been neglected. So immersed was Mr Tempest and his triast-test explorations. Many people said openly that the vicar was paused his work, and should be pinched off. Mrs. Gabriel, a capable and managing woman, had once hinted as much to him. But the usually placid person had flown into such a rage, and she had hastily withdrawed herself and a suggestion. This nothing more terrible than the rebellion of a sheep, Mrs. Gabriel recalls this remark of Balzax, who intempest, proving himself worthy of his name, stripte and wroth from his study. Pratt was quite another specimen of humanity, a neat, diaper, swall little man, undersized yet perfectly proportioned. Yet black hair, black eyes, and a clean-shaven face, which constantly wore an expression of impertable good humour. His stress was too neat for the country. Ablu's search suite, white spats on brown boots, epinama hat, blouse, and what he was never without, a smoothly rolled umbrella. Speaking span, he made a step-doubt of a glass case, and this was in variable appearance. No one ever saw Pratt, unshaven, or untidy. He had been everywhere at scene everything, and was a most engaging companion, never out of temper and never bored. But for all his smiling ways, the villagers held a roof from him. Wishing to break down the barrier of prejudice, the sharply lymatican and attached himself to the vicar, during the good man's usual morning walk. He thought that such a sight might dispost the villagers to relance. I shall not vary my usual walk, remark Mr. Tempest positively. We will stroll through the village, a written to the chapel, and then Mr. Pratt, I hope you will lunch with me. Delighted, if it will not put Mr. Simbalaut. No, no, my wife has always prepared for chance, was it us, answered the vicar, quite oblivious of the fact that the late Mrs. Tempest was resting the churchyard. Ah, this is Mrs. Giel. How do you do Mrs. Giel? Mrs. Giel was an excellent health and said so with the cutesy. A dumpy, rosy-faced woman was Mrs. Giel, with a pair of extremely wicked black eyes, which snapped fire when she was angered. She had a temper but rarely displayed it. For it suited her better to gain a end-spick craft rather than force. 15 years ago, she had appeared from nowhere to settle as a midwife and colisthen. Contrary to the usual fashion, the villagers had taken her to their bosoms. This was going to the clever way, Mrs. Giel had of managing them and to a knowledge of herps. She had cured many sick people whom the doctor had given up, and consequently was not looked upon with favourbed Dr. James, who had succeeded to the family practice. But even he could not be angry at rosy- laughing Mrs. Giel. Though I don't like her confessed Dr. James, the devil looks out of eyes, dangerous woman, very dangerous. Pratt had no chance of proving this remark of the doctors to be true for Mrs. Giel never looked at him. She kept her wicked eyes on the kindly-recard and smile constantly, punctuating such smiles with an occasional cutesy. Perl is not with you, said Mr. Tempest. No, bless a poor heart, quite Mrs. Giel. She's up at the chapel. Her favourite place is a chapel as your reference knows. She might have a first place to haunt Mrs. Giel, poor soul, poor mad innocent child. Do you call 18 years of age childishness tempest? Ask the woman. No, no, I speak of a mind, a poor weak mind, she's still a child. A beggar for you to look after her Mrs. Giel, we must make a path as pleasant as we may. Then I beg your reference, will tell that barker to leave her alone. Barker, barker, ah yes, the section of course, worthy man, Mrs. Giel snift. He won't let us stay in the chapel, she said. Tuttutt, this must be seen too. For Perl is called Shalms' Giel, so she asks her right to rest in his house. Yes, yes, I'll see to it. Good name is his Giel. The woman dropped a curtsy and for the first time, shorter glance at Prat was smiling blindly. And now is the expression crossed to face as she caught a sight. The next woman should draw herself up and pass on crossing her seat. Prat looked after her still smiling, then hurried to rejoin the vicar, who began to explain in his usual wandering way. A good woman, Mrs. Giel, a good woman, he said. For some years, she had a charge of Perl Dary, whom she rescued from a cruel father. Is that the insane girl, said Prat idly? Do not talk of one so afflicted in that way, Mr. Prat. Perl may not be quite right in her head, but she is sane enough to conduct her self-problem. If the fact that she's not all-hustle-reased, poor friend, the principal tone of the county, it is possible that the authorities went wish to shut her up and that would be the death of Perl. No, no, said the good vicar. Let her have a fair share of God's beautiful earth and live to a happy old age. In this quiet place, we can afford one natural. Like the village, it would read about in Scotchdale's, said Prat. Just so, Mr. Prat, in Waiboli, there is such a one. Perl Dary is quite harmless and really has a very beautiful nature. Mrs. Giel is much to be commended for our charity. If she looks at charitable women, said the American, but whether he meant this ironically or not, it is hard to say. The women of colisitor have a mostly lace work arts and toilet is very like craft, while the husbands worked in the fields below. During three seasons, the mountain men, as they might be called, plowed the metal land, sewed the corn and helped to reap and harvest it. In the winter, they returned to live on the earnings and take a holiday. But the women worked all the year through and colisitor lace was famous. As the vicar and Prat walked on straight at the door of every house, sat a woman, with a pillow and pins, dexterously making the filmy fabric, which was designed to add on the dress of many a London beauty. They were mostly serious looking and some even prim, but all had a smile for the vicar, although they first up their lip when they saw the good nature at face of Prat. Most unaccountable, distist like they had for the American. He was rather annoyed by his pronounced unpopularity. I must really do something to make them like me, you said much next. Touch at reply the vicar. Liking will come in good time as to Prat. It takes some years for them to fancy a stranger. I was an object of distressed to them for quite three. Now they are devoted to me. And have you been here long? About 40 years, set ten paced. I have buried many in Christian most. We have no Methodist in Coliseum, Mr. Prat. Everyone comes to church and worships according to the rights of the Anglican Communion has his fit and proper. I suppose you have prosperous community in the whole. So, so nothing to complain of. The last media by those clever fingers sells well in London and even abroad. Then the men are in a fair wage in Kings Middleses. Mrs. Gabriel looks after the few poor we have amongst us. On the whole we have much to be thankful for Mr. Prat. Thus talking the good vicar led his companion round to the moulding walls where they could look down onto the plains. After a glance they re-enter the town and walk through the cobblestone streets between the quaint high-roaked houses. Everywhere the vicar was greeted and Prat from the pond. This quite plad when they descended from the village through the old gate and after walking along the neck which was a fashionable part of Coliseum began to climb up towards this chapel. And most wonderful spot said Prat lightly. But I guess the folk don't cotton to me. I must make them freeze on somehow.

The Gutting of Couffignal,Dashiell Hammett,37419,1.0,"November 15, 2022",[],0,"visit librovox.org. Red by Winston Farb. The gutting of cofignal. Section 1. 1. Red shaped cofignal is not a large island and not far from the mainland, to which is as linked by a wooden bridge. Its western shore is a high-strait cliff that jumps abruptly up out of sand Pablo Bay. From the top of this cliff, the island slopes eastward down to a smooth pebble beach that runs into the water again, whether appears in a clubhouse and mord pleasure boats. So Fignell's main street, paralleling the beach, has the usual bank hotel moving pictured the other in stores, but it differs from most main streets of its size and that it is more carefully arranged and preserved. There are trees and hedges and strips of lawn on it and no glaring signs. The buildings seem to belong beside one another, as if they have been designed by the same architect. And in the stores, you will find goods of equality to match the best city stores. The intersecting streets, running between rows of neat cottages near the foot of the slope, become winding hedged roads as they climb toward the cliff. The higher these roads get the farther apart and larger are the houses they lead to. The occupants of these higher houses are the owners and rulers of the island. Most of them are well-fed old gentlemen who the prophets they took from the world with both hands in their younger days, now stowed away at safe percentages, have bought into the island colony so they may spend what is left of their lives nursing their livers and improving their golf among their kind. They admit to the island only as many storekeepers working people and similar riff-rath has are needed to keep them comfortably served. That is Gofignell. It was sometime after midnight. I was sitting in a second story room in Cofignell's largest house, surrounded by wedding presence whose value would add up to something between 50 and 100 thousand dollars. Of all the work that comes to a private detective except divorce work, which the continental detective agency doesn't handle, I like weddings as little as any. Usually I manage to avoid them, but this time I had been able to. Dick Foley, who had been slated for the job, have had handed a black eye by an unfriendly pickpocket the day before. That let Dick out and me in. I had come up to Cofignell a two-hour ride from San Francisco by ferry and auto-stage that morning and would return the next. This had been neither better nor worse than the usual running detail. The ceremony had been performed at a little stone church down the hill. In the house I began to fill with reception guests. They had kept it filled overflowing until some time after the bride and groom had sneaked off to the eastern train. The world had been well represented. There had been an admiral in an earlier two from England, an ex-president of a South American country. A Danish barren, a tall young Russian princess, surrounded by lesser titles, including a fat, bald, jovial and black-bearded, Russian general who had talked to me for a solid hour about price-fice and which he had a lot of interest, but not so much knowledge as was possible. An ambassador from one of the central European countries, adjusts us of the Supreme Court, and a mob of people who is prominence and dear prominence didn't carry labels. In theory, an detective guarding wedding presents is supposed to make himself indistinguishable from the other guests, and practice it never works out that way. The guests have spent most of his time with inside of the booty, so he's easily spotted. Besides that, eight or ten people I recognized among the guests were clients or former clients of the agency, and so knew me. However being known doesn't make so much difference as you might think and everything had gone off smoothly. A couple of the groom's friends, warmed by wine, and the necessity of maintaining their reputations as cut-ups, had tried to smuggle some of the gifts out of the room where they were displayed and hide them in the piano, but I had been expecting that familiar trick and blocked it before it had gone far enough to embarrass anybody. Shortly after dark, a wind-smelling rain began to pile storm clouds up over the bay. Those guests who lived at a distance, especially those who had watered across, hurried off for their homes. Those who lived on the island stayed until the first rain drops began to patter down, then they left. The Hendricks'in house quieted down, musicians at extra-servant slept. The weary house servants began to disappear in the direction of their bedrooms. I found some sandwiches, a couple of books, an uncomfortable armchair, and took them up to the room where the presents were now hidden under gray white sheeting. The Hendricks'in the bride's grandfather, she was an orphan, put his head in the door. Have you everything you need for your comfort? He asked. Yes, thanks. He said good night and went off to bed, a tall old man, slim as a boy. The wind of the rain were hard at it when I went downstairs to give the lower windows and doors the up and down. Everything on the first floor was tied in secure, everything in the cellar. I went upstairs again. Pulling my chair over by a floor lamp, I put sandwiches, books, ash tray, gone and flashlight on a small table beside it. Then I switched off the other lights, set fire to a fethema, sat down, wriggled my spine comfortably into the chair's padding, picked up one of the books, and prepared to make a night of it. The book was called the Lord of the Sea, and had to do with a strong, tough and violent fellow named Hogarth, whose modest plan was to hold the world in one hand. There were plots and counterplots, kidnappings, murders, prison breakings, forgeries and burglaries, diamonds large as hats, and floating forts larger than co-fignell. It sounds dizzy here, but in the book it was as real as a dime. Hogarth was still going strong when the lights went out. 2. In the dark I got rid of the glowing end of my cigarette by grinding and at one of the sandwiches. Putting the book down, I picked up gun and flashlight and moved away from the chair. Listening for noises was no good, the storm was making hundreds of them. What I needed to know was why the lights had gone off, all the other lights in the house had been turned off some time ago, so the darkness of the hall told me nothing. I waited. My job was to watch the presence, nobody had touched them yet. It was nothing to get excited about. Minutes went by, perhaps ten of them. The floor swayed under my feet. The window was rattled with a violence beyond the strength of the storm, the dull boom of a heavy explosion blotted out the sounds of wind and falling water. The blast was not close at hand, but not far enough away to be off the island. Crossing to the window, peering to the wet glass I could see nothing. I should have seen a few misty lights fart down the hill. Not being able to see them settled one point. The lights had gone out all over Cofignell, not only in the Hendrickson house. That was better. The storm could have put the lighting system out of whack, could have been responsible for the explosion. Maybe. Staring through the black window, I had an impression of great excitement down the hill of movement in the night. It all was too far away from me to have seen or heard even had their ventilates, and all too vague to say what was moving. The impression was strong, but worthless, didn't lead anywhere. I told myself I was getting feeble-minded and turned away from the window. Another blast spun me back to it. This explosion sounded nearer than the first, maybe because it was stronger. Peering through the glass again I still saw nothing. I still had the impression of things that were big moving down there. Bare feet padded in the hall. Voice was anxiously calling my name. Turning from the window again, I pocketed my gun and stepped on the flashlight. Keith Hendrickson and pajamas in Bathrobe looking thinner and older than anybody could be, came into the room. Is it? I don't think it's an earthquake I said, since that is the first calamity or California in thinks of. The lights went off a little while ago. There have been a couple of explosions down the hill, so I stopped. Three shots close together had sounded. Rifles shots, but of the sort that only the heaviest of rifles could make. Then sharp and small in the storm came the report of a faraway pistol. What is it? Hendrickson demanded. Shooting. More feet were paddering the hall, some bear, some shod. Excited voices, whispered questions and exclamations. The Butler, a solemn solid block of a man, partly dressed in carrying a lighted five-froned candlestick came in. Part of good, profi, Hendrickson said, as the Butler put the candlestick on the table beside my sandwiches. Will you try to learn what is the matter? I have tried, sir. Telephones used to be out of water, sir. Shall I send all of our down to the village? No, I don't suppose it's that serious. Do you think it is anything serious? Yes, me. I said I didn't think so, but I was paying more attention to the outside than him. I had heard a thin screaming that could have come from a distant woman, and a volley of small arm shots. The rocket of the storm muffled these shots, but when the heavier firing that we had heard before broke out again, it was clear enough. To have opened the window would have been to let in gallons of water without helping us to hear much clearer. I stood with an ear tilted to the pain, trying to arrive at some idea of what was happening outside. Another sound took my attention from the window, the ringing of the doorbell, and rang loudly and persistently. Hendrickson looked at me, I nodded. I said, who it is, Profé. He said, the Butler went solemnly away and came back even more solemnly. Then says Choukovsky, he announced. She came running into the room, the tall Russian girl I had seen at the reception. Her eyes were wide and dark with excitement. Her face was very wide and wet. Water ran and streams down her blue waterproof cape, the hood of which covered her dark hair. All Mr. Hendrickson. She had caught one of his hands in both of hers. Her voice, with nothing foreign in its accents, was the voice of one who was excited over a delightful surprise. The bank is being robbed, and the what you call him, Marshall Police has been killed. What's that? The old man exclaimed jumping awkwardly because water from her cape had dripped down on one of his bare feet. Wegan killed, and the bank robbed? Yes, isn't it terrible? She said it as if she were saying wonderful. And her first explosion woke us, the general said it that he's identified out what was the matter, and he got down there just in time to see the bank plown up. Listen. We listened, and heard a wild outbreak of mixed gunfire. Helen joy himself most wonderfully, as soon as Ignati returned with the news, the general armed every mail in the household from Alexander Scrivich to Ivan the Cook, and led them out happier than he's been since he took his division to East Prussia in 1914, and the Duchess, and Rysson asked. He left her at home with me, of course, and I furthered the crap to out and away from her, while she was frying for the first time in her life to put water in a Samovar. This is not the night for one to stay at home. Hmm, and Rysson said, as mine obviously not on her words, and the bank, he looked at me, I said nothing. The racket of another wall he came to us. Could you do anything down there? He asked. Maybe, but I nodded at the presence under their covers. Oh, those, the old man, said, I'm as much interested in the bank as in them. Besides, we will be here. All right. I was willing enough to carry my curiosity down the hill. I'll go down. You'd better have the Butler stay in here and plant the chauffeur inside the front door. But I'll give them guns if you have any. Is there a raincoat I can borrow? I brought only a light overcoat with me. Profi found a yellow slicker that fit me. I put it on, stowed gun and flashlight conveniently under it, and found my hat, while Profi was getting and loading an automatic pistol for himself, and a rifle for Oliver, the Milato Chofurre. Hendrickson and the princess followed me down stairs. With a door I found she wasn't exactly following me, she was going with me. But Sonja, the old man, protested. I'm not going to be foolish, but I'd like to. She promised him. But I'm going back to my Ivorynia, undrolvna, who will perhaps have the smell of our watered by now? That's a sensible girl, Hendrickson said, and let us out into the rain and the wind. It wasn't weather to walk in, and silence we turned down hill between two rows of hedging with the storm driving at our backs. At the first break in the hedge I stopped nodding toward the black blotter house made. That is your, her laugh caught me short. She caught my arm and began to urge me down the road again. I only told Mr. Hendrickson that so we would not worry. She explained. You don't I think I'm not going down to see the sights? Three. She was tall, I am short, and thick. I had to look up to see her face. To see as much of it as the rain-grained night would let me see. You'll be soaked to the hide running around in this rain. I objected. What of that? I'm dressed for it. She raised a foot to show me a heavy waterproof boot and a woolen stalking leg. There's no telling what we're running into down there, and I've got work to do. I insisted. I'm looking out for you. I can look out for myself. She pushed her capicide to show me a square automatic pistol in one hand. You'll be in my way. I will not. She retorted. You're probably fine. I can help you. I'm as strong as you and quicker, and I can shoot. The reports of scattered shooting had punctuated our argument, but now the sound of heavier firing, silence that doesn't objections to her company that I could still think of. After all, I could slip away from her in the dark if she became too much of a nuisance. That was your own way, I growl. But don't expect anything from me. You're so kind. She murmured as we got underway again, hurrying now, with a wind at our back speeding us along. Occasionally dark figures moved on the road ahead of us, but too far away to be recognizable. Presently a man passed us, running uphill, a tall man whose night shirt hung out of his trousers down below his coat, identifying him as a resident. They finished the back on a red-medcrafts, he yelled as he went by. Medcraft is the jeweler. The girl informed me. The sloping under our feet grew less sharp. The houses dark but with faces vaguely visible here and there at the windows came closer together. Below the flash of a gun could be seen now and then orange streaks in the rain. Our road put us into the lower end of the main street, just as a cicado ratatat broke out. I pushed the girl into the nearest doorway and jumped in after her. Bullets ripped through walls with a sound of hail tapping on leaves. That was the thing I had taken for an exceptionally heavy arrival, a machine gun. The girl had fallen back in a corner all tangled up with something. I helped her up. That something was a boy of 17 or so with one leg and a crutch. It's the boy who delivers papers. Princess Jokufsky said, And you've hurt him with your clumsiness. The boy shook his head, grinning as he got up. No, I ain't hurt none, but you kind of scared me, jumping on me like that. She had to stop and explain that she hadn't jumped on him, that she had been pushed into him by me and that she was sorry and so was I. What's happening? I asked the news boy when I could get a word in. Everything he boasted is if some of the credit were his. There must be a hundred of them and they blow the bank wide open and now some of them in the mid-class and I just said blow that up too. And they killed Tom Weagan. They got a machine gun on a car in the middle of the street. That's it shooting now. Where's everybody? All the merry villagers. Most of them are up behind the hall. They can't do nothing though because the machine gun won't let him near enough to see what they're shooting at. And that smart bill of Vincent told me to clear out because I've only got one leg as if I couldn't shoot as good as the next one. If I only had something to shoot with, that wasn't right of them. I sympathize. But you can do something for me. You can stick here and keep your eye on this end of the street so I'll know if they leave in this direction. You're not just saying that's all to hear out of the way, are you? No, I lied. I need somebody to watch. I was going to leave the princess here, but you'll do better. Yes. She backed me up, catching the idea. This gentleman is a detective. And if you do what he asks, you'll be helping more than if you were up there with the others. The machine gun was still firing, but not an art direction now. I'm going across the street. I told the girl, if you aren't you going to join the others? No. If I can get around behind the bandets while they're busy with the others, maybe I can turn a trick. Watch sharp now. I ordered the boy. And the princess said I made a dash for the opposite sidewalk. We reached it without drawing lead, sighted along a building for a few yards and turned into an alley. From the alley's other end came the smell and wash and the dull blackness of the bay. While we moved down this alley, I composed a scheme by which I hoped to get rid of my companion, sending her off on a safe wild goose chase, but I didn't get a chance to try it out. The big figure of a man loomed ahead of us. Having in front of the girl I went on toward him, under my slicker I held my gun on the middle of him. He stood still. He was larger than he had looked at first, a big, slow-shouldered, barrel-bodied husky. His hands were empty. I spotted the flashlight on his face for a split second. A flat-sheet thick-featured face with high cheekbones and a lot of ruggedness in it. Ignati. The girl exclaimed over my shoulder. He began to talk when I suppose was rushing to the girl. She laughed and replied, he shook his big head stubbornly and sisting on something. She stamped her foot and spoke sharply. He shook his head again and addressed me. To under a pleshqueef, he tell me to bring Princess Sonia to home. His anglox was almost as arid to understand as his russian. His tone puzzled me. It was as if he were as explaining some absolutely necessary thing that he didn't want to be blamed for, but nevertheless he was going to do. While a girl was speaking to him, again I guessed the answer. This big ignatty had been set out by the general to bring the girl home and he was going to obey his orders if he had a carrier. He was trying to avoid trouble with me by explaining the situation. Take her, I said, stepping aside. The girl scowled at me, laughed. Very well, like thoughty. She said in English, I shall go home. When she turned on her heel and went back up the alley, the big man close behind her. Glad to be alone, I wasted no time in moving in the opposite direction until the pebbles of the beach were under my feet. The pebbles ground harshly under my heels. I moved back to more silent ground and began to work my way as swiftly as I could up the shore toward the center of action. The machine gun barked on, smaller guns snapped. Three cuckons close together. Boms hand grenades my ears and my memory told me. The stormy sky glared pink over a roof ahead of me into the left. The boom of the blast beat my aer drums. Frugn what I couldn't see fell around me. That I thought would be the jewelers' safe blowing apart. I crept on up the shoreline, the machine gun went silent. Lighter guns snapped, snapped, snapped. Another grenade went off. His voice shrieked pure terror. Risking the crunch of pebbles I turned down to the water's edge again. I had seen no dark shape on the water that could have been a boat. There had been boats moored along this beach in the afternoon. With my feet in the water the bay I still saw no boat. The storm could have scattered them, but I didn't think it had. The island's western height shielded this shore. The wind was strong here but not violent. My feet sometimes on the edge of the pebbles, sometimes in the water. I went up the shoreline. Now I saw a boat. A gently bobbing black shape I had. No light was on it. Nothing I could see moved on it. It was the only boat on that shore that made it important. Foot by foot I approached. A shadow moved between me in the dark rear of a building. I froze. The shadow, man's size, moved again in the direction from which I was coming. Waiting I didn't know how nearly invisible or how plain I might be against my background. I couldn't risk giving myself away by trying to improve my position. Twenty feet from me the shadow suddenly stopped. I was seen. My gun was on the shadow. Come on, I cried softly. Keep crying. Let's see who you are. The shadow hesitated left the shelter of the building. Groo Neerer. I couldn't risk the flashlight. I made out dimly a handsome face, boistery reckless, one cheek dark stained. Oh, how do you do? The face's owner said in a musical baritone voice. You were at the reception this afternoon. Yes. Have you seen Princess Chukovsky? You know her? She went home with a naughty 10 minutes or so ago. Excellent. He wiped his stain cheek with a stained handkerchief and turned to look at the boat. That's Hendrix's boat. He whispered. They've got it and they've cast the others off. That would mean they're gone out, leave by water. Yes, he agreed. Unless shall we have a try at it? You mean jump it? Why not? Yes. That can't be many aboard. God knows there enough of them ashore. You're armed. I've a pistol. Was sized up first, I decided. Someone all were jumping. That is wisdom, he said. And led the way toward the shelter of the buildings. Hugging the rear walls of the buildings we stole toward the boat. The boat grew clearer in the night. A craft perhaps 45 feet long, it's stern to the shore, rising and falling beside a small pier. Across the stern something protruded, something I couldn't quite make out. Let their souls scuffle down on an wooden deck. Presently a dark head and shoulders showed over the puzzling thing in the stern. The Russian lads eyes were better than mine. Mast, he breathed him on air. Something like a stalking over his head and face. The vast man was motionless where he stood. We were motionless where we stood. Could you hit him from here? The lad asked. Maybe, but night and the rain aren't a good combination for sharp shooting. Our best bet is to sneak his closest we can and start shooting when he spots us. That is wisdom. He agreed. Discovery came with our first step forward. The man on the boat grunted. The lad at my side jumped forward. I recognized the thing in the boat's stern just in time to throw a leg out and trip the young Russian. He tumbled down all sprawled out on the pebbles. I dropped behind him. The machine gun in the boat's stern poured metal over our heads.

Handel,Romain Rolland,26867,2.0,"November 19, 2022",[],0,". Handel by Romain Rolum translated by Arthur E. Gophield Hall, Preface Introduction by the editor, Preface, for a proper appreciation of the Colossal work of Handel many years of study and a book of some 200 pages are very insufficient to treat it all adequately of Handel's life and work needs a whole lifetime in itself and even the indifatricable and enthusiastic prisoner who devoted his life to this subject has hardly encompassed the task. I have done what I could. My faults must be excused. This little book does not pretend to be anything more than a very brief sketch of the life and technique of Handel. I hope to study his character, his work, and his times more in detail in another volume. Romain Rolum Introduction by the editor. Here in England we are supposed to know our Handel by heart, but it is doubtful whether we do, who can say from memory the titles of even six of his 39 operas from once may be called many of his choice's flowers of melody. Misier Lillum Rightly emphasizes the importance of the operas of Handel in the long chain of musical evolution and it seems impossible for anyone to lay down his book without having him or all around impression than here to four of this giant among composers. Misier Lillum Sensei Once compared the position of a conductor in front of the score of Handel or Torio to that of a man who sought to settle with his family in some old mansion which has been uninhabited for centuries. The music was different altogether from that to which he was accustomed. No nuances, no boring, frequently no indication of rate and often merely a sketched in base. Tradition only could guide him and the English who alone could have preserved his, he considers have lost it. Can it be recovered to an extent and is so, how? Behind each tall-rained figure of genius are to be found numbers of eloquent men who prepare the way for him and amongst these precursors there is frequently discovered one who exercised and dominated influence over the young budding genius. Such an influence was exercised by Zahkal on Handel and Misier Lillum rightly gives due importance to the consideration of this old master's teachings and compositions, a careful study of which Chigofar to supplying the right key to Handel's music. One of the great shortcomings in the general musical listener is the lack of the historical view of music. It is a long cry from Bach and Handel to Debussy and Screabin, but we should be all the better for looking well in both ends of the long musical chain which connects the unvoiced expression of the past with the vague yet certain hopes of the future. No doubt we have hardly yet recovered from the false position into which we have all helped to place Handel. He was never the great church composer which has been assumed for so long. Perhaps rather he leaned to the pagan side of life in his art. As Mr. Straitfile says, you can no more call the Messiah of work of art than you can call the book of common prayer popular as a masterpiece of literature. Handel the preacher is laid forever in the tomb but Handel the artist with his all embracing sympathy for human things and his delight in the world around him lives forever more. Handel has been greatly almost woofly misrepresented but he has played two great a part in the history of English music to be cast aside on this account. It is true that there are many difficulties in the way of a clear understanding of his music. A 200 years overgrowth of vain vocal traditions is not going to be torn away in the space of a few years. If the operas have been overlooked and favor of the oratorios, then his instrumental music has been even more neglected on account of the preponderance of his vocal movements. In a recent important contribution to Handelian biography, only a few pages are given to the instrumental works. In this respect, Monsieur Rollans, clear and critical biography, fills in a distinct hiatus. Moreover, Handel, sojourned in Germany, Italy, finally and longest in England but never in France. Monsieur Rollans, therefore, a Frenchman and the author of that brilliant work he starred to Lopera on Europe of Italy, a Skalati, may more than any other writer be expected to bring a freshness and vision and impartial judgment to bear on Handel's works. And he has not disappointed us, pay each end of section one.","Biography & Autobiography, Music",English,03:55:50,mkirkpat,"['Handelian', 'Frenchman', 'Handel']","['Debussy', 'Romain Rolum Introduction', 'Straitfile', 'Bach', 'Screabin', 'Arthur E.

For more information or to volunteer, please visit Librevox.org. Read by Kristen Hand. A collection of the facts and documents relative to the death of major general Alexander Hamilton by William Coleman, Part 1. In the following pages, we'll be found a satisfactory account of the shocking catastrophe which has deprived America of her most valuable citizen, and our age of the greatest man. Together with some brief remarks calculated to place the melancholy affair in its true light, both as it respects the deceased, and him by whose arm he was slain. Perhaps the most satisfactory manner of introducing the reader to his subject will be to begin with a correspondence which led to the fatal interview. It follows. Number 1. New York, June 18, 1804. Sir, I send for your perusal a letter signed Charles D. Cooper, which though apparently published some time ago, has but very recently come to my knowledge. Mr. Van Ness, who does me the favor to deliver this, will point out to you that clause of the letter to which I particularly request your attention. You must perceive, sir, the necessity of a prompt and unqualified acknowledgement or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertions of Dr. Cooper. I have the honor to be your obedient servant, A. Burr. General Hamilton. Number 2. New York. June 20, 1804. Sir, I have maturely reflected on the subject of your letter of the 18th instant, and the more I have reflected, the more I have become convinced that I could not without manifest impropriety, make the eval or disavowl which you seem to think necessary. The clause pointed out by Mr. Van Ness is in these terms, I could detail to you a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr. To endeavor to discover the meaning of this declaration, I was obliged to seek in the antecedent part of this letter for the opinion to which it referred as having been already disclosed. I found it in these words. General Hamilton and Judge Ken have declared in substance that they looked upon Mr. Burr to be a dangerous man and one who ought not to be trusted with the reigns of government. The language of Dr. Cooper plainly implies that he considered this opinion of you which he attributes to me as a despicable one, but he affirms that I have expressed some other more despicable without however mentioning to whom when or where. To his evidence that the phrase still more despicable admits of infinite shades from very light to very dark. How am I to judge of the degree intended? Or how shall I annex any precise idea to language so indefinite? Between gentlemen, despicable and more despicable are not worth the pains of distinction. When therefore you do not interrogate me as to the opinion which is specifically ascribed to me, I must conclude that you view it as within the limits to which the animate versions of political opponents upon each other may justifyably extend. And consequently, as not warranting the idea of it which Dr. Cooper appears to entertain. If so, what precise inference could you draw? As a guide for your conduct, where I to acknowledge that I had expressed an opinion of you still more despicable than the one which is particularized. How could you be sure that even this opinion had exceeded the bounds which you would yourself deemed admissible between political opponents? But I forbear further comment on the embarrassment to which the requisition you have made naturally leads. The occasion for bids a more ample illustration though nothing could be more easy than to pursue it. Repeating that I cannot reconcile it with propriety to make the acknowledgement or denial you desire, I will add that I deem it in admissible on principle to consent to be interrogated as to the justness of the inferences which may be drawn by others from whatever I may have said of a political opponent in the course of 15 years competition. If there were no other objections to it, this is sufficient that it would tend to expose my sincerity and delicacy to injurious imputations from every person who may at any time have conceived the import of my expressions. And differently from that I may have then have intended or may afterwards recollect. I stand ready to evow or disavow promptly and explicitly any precise or definite opinion which I may be charged with having declared of any gentleman. I am not fitly be expected from me and especially it cannot be reasonably expected that I shall enter into an explanation upon a basis so vague as that which you have adopted. I trust on more reflection you will see the matter in the same light with me. If not, I can only regret the circumstance and must abide the consequences. I have the honor to be, etc. A. Hamilton. Colonel Burr. New York 21st June 1804. Sir, your letter of the 20th instant has been this day received, having considered it attentively I regret to find in it nothing of that sincerity and delicacy which you profess to value. Political opposition can never absolve gentlemen from the necessity of a rigid adherence to the laws of honor and the rules of decorum. I neither claim such privilege nor indulge it in others. The common sense of mankind fixes to the epithet adopted by Dr. Cooper, the idea of dishonor. It has been publicly applied to me under the sanction of your name. The question is not whether he has understood the meaning of the word or has used it according to syntax and with grammatical accuracy. But whether you have authorized this application either directly or by uttering expressions or opinions derogatory to my honor. The time when is in your own knowledge but no way material to me as the columny has now first been disclosed so as to become the subject of my notice and as the effect is present and palpable. Your letter has furnished me with new reasons for requiring a definite reply. I have the honor to be sir, your obedient A. Burr. General Hamilton. On Saturday 22nd of June, General Hamilton for the first time called on Mr. Pendleton and communicated to him the preceding correspondence. He informed him that in a conversation with Mr. Van Nass at the time of receiving the last letter he told Mr. Van Nass that he considered that letter as rude and offensive and that it was not possible for him to give it any other answer. Then that Mr. Burr must take such steps as he might think proper. He said farther that Mr. Van Nass requested him to take time to deliberate and then return an answer when he might possibly entertain a different opinion and that he would call on him to receive it. That his reply to Mr. Van Nass was that he did not perceive it possible for him to give any other answer than that he had mentioned unless Mr. Burr would take back his last letter and write one which would admit of a different reply. He then gave Mr. Pendleton the letter here after mentioned on the 22nd of June to be delivered to Mr. Van Nass when he should call on Mr. Pendleton for an answer and went to his country house. Today General Hamilton received while there the following letter. Number 4. June 23rd, 1804. Sir. In the afternoon of yesterday I reported to Colonel Burr the result of my last interview with you and appointed the evening to receive his further instructions. So I'm private engagements however prevented me from calling on him till this morning. On my return to the city I found upon inquiry both at your office and house that you had returned to your residents in the country. Lest an interview there might be less agreeable to you than elsewhere I have taken the liberty of addressing you this note to inquire when and where it will be most convenient to you to receive a communication. Your most obedient and very humble servant W. P. Van Nass General Hamilton. Mr. Pendleton understood from General Hamilton that he immediately answered that if the communication was pressing he would receive it at his country house that day. If not he would be at his house in town the next morning at 9 o'clock. But he did not give Mr. Pendleton any copy of this note. Number 5. New York June 22nd, 1804. Sir. Your first letter in a style 2 pre-emptory made a demand in my opinion unprecedented and unwarrantable. My answer pointing out the embarrassment to gave you an opportunity to take a less acceptable course. You have not chosen to do it but by your last letter received this day containing expressions in the chorus and in proper. You have increased the difficulties to explanation intrinsically incident to the nature of your application. If by a definite reply you mean the direct of owl or disavowl required in your first letter I have no other answer to give than that which has already been given. If you mean anything different admitting of greater latitude it is requisite you should explain. I have the honor to be Sir. Your obedient servant, Alex Hamilton. Erin Burr. S. Claire. This letter, although dated on 23 June, remained in Mr. Pendleton's possession until the 25th. Within which period he had several conversations with Mr. Van Ness. In these conversations Mr. Pendleton endeavored to illustrate and enforce the propriety of the ground General Hamilton had taken. Mr. Pendleton mentioned to Mr. Van Ness as the result that if Colonel Burr would write a letter requesting to know in substance, whether in the conversation to which Dr. Cooper alluded any particular instance of dishonorable conduct was imputed to Colonel Burr or whether there was any impeachment of his private character. General Hamilton would declare the best of his recollection what passed in that conversation. And Mr. Pendleton read Mr. Van Ness a paper containing the substance of which General Hamilton would say on that subject which is as follows. Number six General Hamilton says he cannot imagine to what Dr. Cooper may have alluded unless it were to a conversation at Mr. Taylor's in Albany last winter, at which he and General Hamilton were present. General Hamilton cannot recollect distinctly the particulars of that conversation, so as to undertake to repeat them without running the risk of varying or omitting what might be deemed important circumstances. The expressions are entirely forgotten and the specific ideas impervictly remembered but to the best of his recollection it consisted of comments on the political principles and views of Colonel Burr and the results that might be expected from them in the event of his election as governor, without reference to any particular instance of past conduct or to private character. After the delivery of the letter of the 22nd as above mentioned, in another interview with Mr. Van Ness he desired Mr. Pendleton to give him in writing the substance of what he had proposed on the part of General Hamilton, which Mr. Pendleton did in the words following. Number seven Any answer to a letter properly adapted to obtain from General Hamilton a declaration whether he had charged Colonel Burr with any particular instance of dishonorable conduct or had impeached his private character. Either in the conversation alluded to by Dr. Cooper or in any other particular instance to be specified, you would be able to answer consistently with his honor and the truth in substance that the conversation to which Dr. Cooper alluded turned wholly on political topics and did not attribute to Colonel Burr any instance of dishonorable conduct, nor relate to his private character. And in relation to any other language or conversation of General Hamilton which Colonel Burr will specify a prompt and frank a vowel or denial will be given. On the 26th June Mr. Pendleton received the following letter. Number eight. Sir, the letter which you yesterday delivered me and your subsequent communication in Colonel Burr's opinion events no disposition on the part of General Hamilton to come to a satisfactory accommodation. The injury complained of and the reparation expected are so definitely expressed in Colonel Burr's letter of the 21st instant that there is not perceived a necessity for further explanation on his part. The difficulty that would result from confining the inquiry to any particular times and occasions must be manifest. The denial of a specified conversation only would leave strong implications that on other occasions improper language had been used. When and where in juris opinions and expressions have been uttered by General Hamilton must be best known to him and of him only will Colonel Burr inquire. No denial or declaration will be satisfactory unless it be General so as wholly to exclude the idea that rumors derogatory to Colonel Burr's honor have originated with General Hamilton or have been fairly inferred from anything he has said. A definite reply to a requisition of this nature was demanded by Colonel Burr's letter of the 21st instant. This being refused invites the alternative alluded to in General Hamilton's letter of the 20th. It was required by the position in which the controversy was placed by General Hamilton on Friday last. Note June 22nd and note and I was immediately furnished with a communication demanding a personal interview. The necessity of this measure has not, in the opinion of Colonel Burr, been diminished by the General's last letter or any communication which has since been received. I am consequently again instructed to deliver you a message as soon as it may be convenient for you to receive it. I beg therefore you will be so good as to inform me at what hour I can have the pleasure of seeing you. Your most obedient and very humble servant WP Veya Ness. Nathaniel Pendleton, S. Quire, June 26th. Number 9. 26th. June 1804. Sir, I have communicated the letter which you did me the honor to write to me of this date to General Hamilton. The expectations now disclosed on the part of Colonel Burr appear to him to have greatly extended the original ground of inquiry. And instead of presenting a particular and definite case for explanation, seemed aim at nothing less than an inquisition into his most confidential conversations, as well as others through the whole period of his acquaintance with Colonel Burr. While he was prepared to meet the particular case fairly and fully, he thinks it's inadmissible that he should be expected to answer at large as to everything that he may possibly have said, in relation to the character of Colonel Burr at any time or upon any occasion. Though he is not conscious that any charges which are in circulation to the prejudice of Colonel Burr have originated with him, except one which may have been so considered and which has long since been fully explained between Colonel Burr and himself, yet he cannot consent to be questioned generally as to any rumors which may be afloat derogatory to the character of Colonel Burr, without specification of the several rumors, many of them probably unknown to him. He does not, however, mean to authorize any conclusion as to the real nature of his conduct in relation to Colonel Burr by his declining soluse and vague abases of explanation. And he disavows an unwillingness to come to a satisfactory, provided it be an honorable accommodation. His objection is the very indefinite ground which Colonel Burr has assumed in which he is sorry to be able to discern nothing short of predetermined hostility. Presuming therefore that it will be adhered to, he has instructed me to receive the message which you have it in charge to deliver. For this purpose I shall be at your home and at your command tomorrow morning from 8 to 10 o'clock. I have the honor to be respectfully your obedient servant Nathaniel Pendleton. William P. Van Ness S. Quire. Number 10. Sir, the letter which I had the honor to receive from you under the date of yesterday, states among other things that in general Hamilton's opinion Colonel Burr has taken a very indefinite ground in which he evinses nothing short of predetermined hostility. And that general Hamilton thinks it is inadmissible that the inquiry should extend to his confidential as well as other conversations. In this Colonel Burr can only reply that secret whispers traducing his frame and impeaching his honor are at least equally injurious with slanders publicly uttered. The general Hamilton had at no time and in no place a right to use any such injurious expressions and that the partial negative he is disposed to give. With the reservations he wishes to make are proofs that he has done the injury specified. Colonel Burr's request was in the first instance proposed in a form the most simple in order that general Hamilton might give to the affair that course to which he might be induced by his temper and his knowledge of facts. Colonel Burr trusted with confidence that from the frankness of a soldier and the candor of a gentleman he might expect an ingenuous declaration. That if as he had reason to believe General Hamilton had used expressions derogatory to his honor he would have had the magnanimity to retract them. And that if from his language injurious inferences had been improperly drawn he would have perceived the propriety of correcting errors which might thus have been widely defused. With these impressions Colonel Burr was greatly surprised at receiving a letter which he considered as evasive and in which manner he deemed not altogether decorous. In one expectation however he was not wholly deceived for the close of General Hamilton's letter contained an intemation that if Colonel Burr should dislike his refusal to acknowledge or deny he was ready to meet the consequences. This Colonel Burr deemed a sort of defiance and would have felt justified in making it the basis of an immediate message. But as the communication contains something concerning the indefiniteness of the request, as he believed it rather the offspring of false pride then of refute. And as he felt the utmost reluctance to proceed to extremities while any other hope remained, his request was repeated in terms more explicit. The replies and propositions on the part of General Hamilton have in Colonel Burr's opinion been constantly in substance the same. Colonel Burr disavows all motives of predetermined hostility a charge by which he thinks insult added to injury. He feels as a gentleman should feel when his honor is impeached or assailed and without sensations of hostility or wishes of revenge, he is determined to vindicate that honor at such hazard as the nature of the case demands. The length to which this course bondment has extended only tending to prove that the satisfactory redress, earnestly desired cannot be obtained. He deems it useless to offer any proposition except the simple message which I shall now have the honor to deliver. I have the honor to be with great respect, your obedience and very humble servant W.P. Van Nes. Wednesday morning June 27, 1804. With this letter a message was received, such as was to be expected, containing an invitation which was accepted and Mr. Pendleton informed Mr. Van Nes, he should hear from him the next day as to further particulars. This letter was delivered to General Hamilton on the same evening at a very short conversation ensued between him and Mr. Pendleton, who was to call on him early the next morning for a further conference. When he did so, General Hamilton said he had not understood whether the message and answer was definitively concluded or whether another meeting was to take place for that purpose between Mr. Pendleton and Mr. Van Nes. Under the latter impression and as the last letter contained matter that naturally led to an amendment version, he gave Mr. Pendleton a paper of remarks in his own handwriting and communicated to Mr. Van Nes if the state of the affair rendered it proper. In an interview with Mr. Van Nes on the same day after explaining the causes which had induced General Hamilton to suppose that the state of the affair did not render it improper. Mr. Pendleton offered this paper to Mr. Van Nes, but he declined receiving it alleging that he considered the correspondence as close by the acceptance of the message that he had delivered. Mr. Pendleton that informed Mr. Van Nes of the inducements mentioned by General Hamilton in the paper, for at least postponing the meeting until the close of the circuit, and as this was uncertain, Mr. Pendleton was to let him know when would be convenient. Here we think it most proper to introduce the paper itself. The reader will form his own judgment whether it was not Mr. Van Nes's duty to have received it and shown it to his principal. He will probably exercise his own conjecture to ask to Mr. Van Nes's motives for not doing so. It follows. Number 11. Remarks on the letter of June 27, 1804. Whether the observations on this letter are designed merely to justify the result which is indicated in the close of the letter, or maybe intended to give an opening for rendering anything explicit which may have been deemed vague here to four can only be judged above by the sequel. At any rate it appears to me necessary not to be misunderstood. Mr. Pendleton is therefore authorized to say that in the course of the present discussion written or verbal, there has been no intention to evade, defy or insult, but a sincere disposition to avoid extremities if it could be done with propriety. With this view, General Hamilton has been ready to enter into a frank and free explanation on any and every object of a specific nature, but not to answer a general and abstract inquiry, embracing a period too long for any accurate recollection and exposing him to unpleasant criticisms from or unpleasant discussions with any and every person who may have understood him in an unfavorable sense. This, admitting that he could answer in a manner the most satisfactory to Colonel Burr, he should deem in admissible, imprnsible and precedent and humiliating in practice. To this, therefore he can never submit. Frequent illusion has been made to slanders said to be in circulation, whether they are openly or inwispers, they have a form and shape and might be specified. If the alternative alluded to in the close of the letter is definitively tendered, it must be accepted. The time, place and manner to be afterwards regulated. I should not think it right in the midst of a circuit court to withdraw my services from those who may have confided important interests to me and expose them to the embarrassment of seeking other counsel, who may not have time to be sufficiently instructed in their causes. I shall also want a little time to make some arrangements respecting my own affairs. On Friday 6 July, the circuit being closed, Mr. Pendleton informed Mr. Van Ness that General Hamilton would be ready at any time after the Sunday following. On Monday, the particulars were arranged. On Wednesday, the parties met at WeHawk on the Jersey Shore at 7 o'clock AM. The particulars of what then took place will appear from the following statements as agreed upon and corrected by the seconds of the parties. Colonel Burr arrived first on the ground and has had been previously agreed. When General Hamilton arrived, the parties exchanged salutations and the seconds proceeded to make their arrangements. They measured the distance, ten full paces, and cast lots for the choice of position, as also to determine by whom the word should be given, both of which fell to the second of General Hamilton. They then proceeded to load the pistols in each other's presence after which the parties took their stations. The gentleman who was to give the word then explained to the parties the rules which were to govern them in firing, which were as follows. The parties being placed at their stations, the second two gives the word, shall ask them whether they are ready, being answered in the affirmative, he shall say present. After this, the party shall present and fire when they please. If one fires before the other, the opposite second to shall say one, two, three fire, and he shall then fire or lose his fire. He then asked if they were prepared, being answered in the affirmative, he gave the word a present, as had been agreed upon, and both parties presented and fired in succession. The intervening time is not expressed as the second do not precisely agree on that point. The fire of Colonel Burr took effect and General Hamilton almost instantly fell. Colonel Burr then advanced toward General Hamilton with a manner ingested that appeared to General Hamilton's friend to be expressive of regret. But without speaking, turned about and withdrew, being urged from the field by his friend, as has been subsequently stated, with a view to prevent his being recognized by the surgeon and bargeman who were then approaching. No further communication took place between the principles and the barge that carried Colonel Burr immediately returned to the city. We can see the proper to add that the conduct of the parties in this interview was perfectly proper as suited the occasion. The above is a statement of only such leading particulars as the seconds supposed it would be proper for them as such to publish. But as I think a deep interest will be felt in every circumstance attending the death of General Hamilton, I have been at some pains to collect all the information on the subject that was to be had from authentic sources. It was nearly seven in the morning when the boat with carried General Hamilton, his friend Mr. Pendleton, and the surgeon mutually agreed on Dr. Hosak, reached the part of the Jersey Shore called the Weehawk. There they found Mr. Burr and his friend Mr. Van Ness, who as I am told had been employed since their arrival with coats off, in clearing away the wishes, limbs of trees, etc. so as to make if they are opening. The parties and a few moments were at their allotted situations. When Mr. Pendleton gave the word Mr. Burr raised his arm slowly, deliberately took his aim and fired. His ball entered General Hamilton's right side, as soon as the bullet struck him, he raised himself involuntarily on his toes, turned a little to the left, at which moment his pistol went off, and fell upon his face. Mr. Pendleton immediately called out for Dr. Hosak, who, in running to the spot, had to pass Mr. Van Ness and Colonel Burr, but Van Ness had the cool precaution to cover his principle with an umbrella, so that Dr. Hosak should not be able to swear that he saw him on the field. What passed after this, the reader will have in the following letter from Dr. Hosak himself, in answer to my note. On his 17th, 1804, dear Sir, to comply with your request is a painful task, but I will repress my feelings while I endeavor to furnish you with an enumeration of such particulars relative to the melancholy end of our beloved friend Hamilton, as well most, on my recollection. When called to him, upon his receiving that fatal wound, I found him half sitting on the ground supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of death, I shall never forget. He had at that instant just strength to say, this is a mortal wound, Dr. when he sunk away and became to all appearance lifeless. I immediately stripped up his clothes and soon, alas, ascertained the direction of the ball must have been through some vital part. Footnote. For the satisfaction of some of General Hamilton's friends, I examined his body after death in the presence of Dr. Post and to other gentlemen. I discovered that the ball struck the second or third false rib and fractured it about in the middle, it then passed through the liver and diaphragm, and as nearly as we could ascertain without a minute examination, lodged in the first or second Lumbar vertebra. The vertebra in which it was launched was considerably splintered so that the speculae were distinctly perceptible to the finger. About a pint of clotted blood was found in the cavity of the belly which had probably been effused from the divided vessels of the liver and note. His pulses were not to be felt, his respiration was entirely suspended and upon laying my hand on his heart and perceiving no motion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone. I however observed to Mr. Pendleton that the only chance for his reviving was immediately to get him upon the water. We therefore lifted him up and carried him out of the wood to the margin of the bank where the bargeman aided us and conveying him into the boat which immediately put off. During all this time I could not discover the least symptom of returning life. I now rubbed his face, lips and temples with spirits of heart shorn, applied it to his neck and breast into the wrists and palms of his hands, and endeavored to pour some into his mouth. When we had got as I should judge about 50 yards from the shore some imperfect efforts to breathe were for the first time manifest, and a few minutes he sighed and became sensible to the impression of the heart shorn or the fresh air of the water. He breathed, his eyes hardly opened, wandered without fixing upon any objects to our great joy he at length spoke. My vision is indistinct, where his first words. His pulse became more perceptible, his respiration more regular, his sight returned. I then examined the wound to know if there was any dangerous discharge of blood upon slightly pressing his side it gave him pain on which I persisted. Soon after recovering his sight he happened to cast his eye upon the case of pistols and observing the one he had had in his hand lying on the outside he said, take care of that pistol, it is un-discharged and still cocked, it may go off and do harm. Pendleton knows attempting to turn his head towards him, that I did not intend to fire at him. Yes, said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his wish, I have already made Dr. Hasic acquainted with your determination as to that. He then closed his eyes and remained calm without any disposition to speak, nor did he say much afterwards, accepting him replied to my questions as to his feelings. He asked me once or twice how I found his pulse and he informed me that his lower extremities had lost all feeling, manifesting to me that he entertained no hope that he should long survive. I changed the posture of his limbs but to no purpose, they had totally lost their sensibility. Perceiving that we approached the shore he said, that Mrs. Hamilton be immediately sent for, that the event be gradually broken to her but give her hopes. Looking up we saw his friend, Mr. Beird, standing on the warf in great agitation. He had been told by his servant that General Hamilton, Mr. Pendleton and myself had crossed the river and a boat together, and too well he conjectured the fatal errand and foreboded the dreadful result. Perceiving as we came nearer that Mr. Pendleton and myself only set up in the stern sheets he clashed his hand together in the most violent apprehension. But when I called to him to have a cop repaired and he had the same moment saw his poor friend lying in the bottom of the boat, he threw up his eyes and burst into a flood of tears and lamentation. Hamilton alone appeared tranquil and composed. We then conveyed him as tenderly as possible up to the house. The distresses of this amiable family were such that till the first shock was abated, they were scarcely able to summon fortitude enough to yield sufficient assistance to their dying friend. Upon our reaching the house he became more languid, occasioned probably by the agitation of his removal from the boat. I gave him a little weak wine and water. When he recovered his feelings he complained of a pain in his back, we immediately undressed him, laid him in bed and darkened the room. I then gave him a large anodine which I frequently repeated. During the first day he took upwards of an ounce of lodne and tepid anodine foam and tations were also applied to those parts nearest the seat of his pain. Yet were his sufferings during the whole of the day almost intolerable, footnote. As his habit was delicate and had been lightly rendered more feeble by ill health, particularly by a disorder of the stomach and bowels, I carefully avoided all those remedies which are usually indicated on such occasions and footnote. I had not the shadow of the hope of his recovery and Dr. Post, whom I requested might be sent for immediately on our reaching Mr. Bayard's house, united with me in this opinion. General Ray, the French consul, also had the goodness to invite the surgeons of the French frigates in our harbor as they had had much experience in gunshot wounds to render their assistance. They immediately came, but to prevent his being disturbed, I stated to them his situation, describe the nature of his wound and the direction of the ball, with all the symptoms that could enable them to form an opinion as to the event. One of the gentlemen then accompanied me to the bedside. The result was a confirmation of the opinion that had already been expressed by Dr. Post and myself. During the night he had some imperfect sleep, but the succeeding morning his symptoms were aggravated, attended however, with a diminution of pain. His mind retained all its usual strength and composure. The great source of his anxiety seemed to be in his sympathy with his half-distracted wife and children. He spoke to me frequently of them. My beloved wife and children were always his expressions. But his fortitude triumphed over his situation dreadful as it was. Once indeed at the sight of his children brought to the bedside together, seven in number, his utterance for succim. He opened his eyes, gave them one look and closed them again till they were taken away. As a proof of his extraordinary composure of mind, let me add that he, along could calm the frantic grief of their mother. Remember, my Eliza, you are a Christian, where the expressions with which he frequently, with a firm voice, but in a pathetic and impressive manner, addressed her. His words in the tone in which they were uttered will never be a face from my memory. At about to a clock as the public well knows he expired. In corrupta fides, do-dake veritas, cuando, limo, invenient parre, multi-sil, cuedem, flea-lease, oxy-deat. I am, sir, your friend and humble servant, David Hossic, William Coleman, Esquire. After his death, a note which had been written, the evening before the interview was found addressed to the gentleman who accompanied him to the field, thanking him with tenderness for his friendship to him, and informing him where would be found the keys of certain drawers in his desk, in which he had deposited such papers as he had thought proper to leave behind him, together with his last will. The following paper, as containing his motives for accepting the challenge, his reflections on the situation, and some remarks on the conduct of the man, who was to be the cause of his death, is presented as a highly interesting document. On my expected interview with Colonel Burr, I think it proper to make some remarks explaining a toy of my conduct, motives, and views. I was certainly desireless of avoiding this interview for the most cogent reasons. One, my religious and moral principles are strongly opposed to the practice of dueling, and it would ever give me pain to be obliged to shed the blood of a fellow creature and a private combat forbidden by the laws. Two, my wife and children are extremely dear to me, and my life is of the utmost importance to them in various views. Three, I feel a sense of obligation towards my creditors who in case of accident to me by the forced sale of my property may be in some degree sufferers. I did not think myself at liberty as a man of property, lightly, to expose them to this hazard. Four, I am conscious of no ill will to Colonel Burr distinct from political opposition, which as I trust has proceeded from pure and upright motives. Lastly, I shall hazard much and can possibly gain nothing by the issue of the interview. But it was as I conceive and possible for me to avoid it. There were intrinsic difficulties in the thing and artificial embarrassment from the manner of proceeding on the part of Colonel Burr. Intrinsic because it is not to be denied that my anamend versions on the political principles, character and view of Colonel Burr have been extremely severe. And on different occasions, I, in common with many others, have made very unfavorable criticisms on particular instances of the private conduct of this gentleman. In proportion as these impressions were entertained with sincerity and uttered with motives and for purposes which might appear to me commendable would be the difficulty until they could be removed by evidence of their being erroneous of explanation or apology. The disavallal required of me by Colonel Burr and a general and indefinite form was out of my power. If it had really been proper for me to submit to be so questioned, but I was sincerely of opinion that this could not be, and in this opinion I was confirmed by that of a very moderate and judicious friend whom I consulted. Besides that, Colonel Burr appeared to me to assume, in the first instance, a tone unnecessarily promptery and menacing and in the second positively offensive. Yet I wished, as far as might be practical, to leave a door open to accommodation. This I think will be inferred from the written communications made by me and by my direction, and would be confirmed by the conversations between Mr. Van Ness and myself which arose out of the subject. I am not sure whether, under all the circumstances, I did not go farther in the attempt to accommodate that a punctillious delicacy will justify. If so, I hope the motives I have stated will excuse me. It is not my design by what I have said to a fix any odium on the conduct of Colonel Burr in this case. He doubtless has heard of animate versions of mine which bore very hard upon him, and it is probable that as usual they were accompanied with some falsehood. He may have supposed himself under a necessity of acting as he has done. I hope the grounds of his proceeding have been such as ought to satisfy his own conscience. I trust at the same time that the world will do me the justice to believe that I have not censured him on light grounds nor from unworthy inducements. I certainly have had strong reasons for what I may have said, though it is possible that in some particulars I may have been influenced by misconstruction or misinformation. It is also my ardent wish that I may have been more mistaken than I think I have been, and that he, by his future conduct, may show himself worthy of all competence and esteem, and prove an ornament and blessing to the country. As well because it is possible that I may have injured Colonel Burr, however convinced myself that my opinions and declarations have been well-founded, as for my general principles and temper in relation to similar affairs, I have resolved if our interview is conducted in the usual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thought even of reserving my second fire in thus giving a double opportunity to Colonel Burr to pause and to reflect. It is not however my intention to enter into any explanations on the ground, a apology from principle I hope rather than pride is out of the question. To those who, with me, abhoring the practice of dueling may think that I ought on no account to have added to the number of bad things to the number of bad examples, I answer that my relative situation as well in public as private, enforcing all the considerations which constitute what men of the world denominate honor, imposed on me as I thought, a peculiar necessity not to decline the call. The ability to be in future useful, whether in resisting mischief or affecting good, in those crises of our public affairs, which seem likely to happen, would probably be inseparable from a conformity with public prejudice, in this particular age. It is impossible for me to add anything that I think will assist the reader informing a judgment on this affecting paper, written under the Solomon Pression that it was to be the last he should ever write. I should do an injustice to his memory to say one word by way of attempting to gain an implicit credit for every syllable it contains. To the head and heart of every reader then it is left without comment. And a section one.",Early Modern,English,06:51:53,KHand,"['French', 'Christian']","['W. P. Van Nass', 'A. Burr', 'Charles D.

Our father's death would fill up all the guilt of civil war and close the scene of blood. Already, Caesar has ravaged more than half the globe, and sees mankind grown thin by his destructive sword. Should he go, father, numbers would be wanting to form new battles and support his crimes. He got. What havoc does ambition make among your works? The Istady temper portius can look on guilt, rebellion fraud and Caesar in the calm lives of mild philosophy. I'm tortured into madness when I think on the proud victor. Every time he's named for salier eyes to my view, I see the insulting tyrant, prancing over the field, strude with Rome's citizens and drenched in slaughter. His horses hoofs wet with patrition blood, oh portius, is there not some chosen curse, some hidden thunder and the stores of heaven, read with uncommon wrath to blast the man who owes his greatness to his country's ruin. Believe me, Marcus, it is an empire's greatness, and mixed with too much horror to be envied. How does the lustor of our father's actions through the dark cloud of hills that cover him, break out, and burn with more triumph and brightness, his suffering shine and spread a glory round him, greatly unfortunate. He fights the cause of honor, virtue, liberty, and Rome. His sword and their fell, but on the guilty head, oppression, tyranny and power used serped, draw all the vengeance of his arm upon them. Who knows not this, but what can K2 do against a world of based, degenerate world that courts the Yoke and Bows and Ecclesis are pent up in Yutica, he veil forms the poor epitome of Rome and greatness, and covered with an emidian guards directs the feeble army at an empty Senate, remnants of mighty battles fought in vain. By heaven such a virtue joined with such success, this tracks my dirty soul, our fathers fortune would earn those 10th to announce his preserves. Remember what our father oft has told us, the ways of heaven are dark and intricate, puzzled in mazes and perplexed with arrows, our understanding traces them in vain, lost and bewildered in the fruitless search, nor seize with how much art the windings run, nor where the regular confusion ends. These are suggestions of a mind at ease, oh, potious, did Stout taste but half the grief that ring my soul, thou couldst not talk thus codely, passion, unpidied and successless love, plant daggers in my heart, and aggrieved my other griefs, but my loosier kind. 40 years aside, thou seest not that thy brother is thy rival, but I must hide it for I know thy temper. Behold young juba, the new midion prince, with how much care he forms himself to glory and breaks the fizziness of his native temper to copy out our father's bright example. He loves our sister, Marcia, greatly loves her. His eyes, his looks, his actions, or betrayed, but still the smothered fondness burns within him, when most it swells and labors for event, the sense of honour and desire of fame, drive the big passion back into his heart. What? Shall an African shout juba's air, reproach great catos son, and show the world a virtue wanting in a Roman soul? Portious no more, your words leave stings behind them, when air did juba or did portious show a virtue that has cast me at a distance and thrown me out in the pursuit of honour. Marcus, I know thy generous temper well, fling but the appearance of dishonour on it, its straight takes fire and mounts into a blaze. A brother suffering's claim, a brother's pity. Heaven knows, I pity thee, behold my eyes, even whilst I speak to thy not swim in tears, where but my heart has naked to thy view, Marcus would see it bleed in his behalf. Why then dost treat me with rebukes instead of kind, condoling cares and friendly sorrow? Oh, Marcus, did I know the white, ease thy troubled heart and mitigate thy pains? Marcus, believe me, I could die to do it. Thou best of brothers and thou best of friends, pardon a weak distempered soul that swells with sudden guss and sinks his soon in combs, the sport of passions, but, simplonia's comes, he must not find this softness hanging on me. Take, exit, Marcus, enter, sampronious, sampronious, aside. Conspiracy's no soon should be formed the next-cuted, what means pauses here, I like not that cold youth, I must disemble and speak a language foreign to my heart. Good moro pauses, let us once embrace, once more embrace, while yet we both are free, tomorrow should we thus express our friendship, each might receive a slave into his arms, this sun, perhaps this morning suns the last day, shall rise on Roman liberty. My father has this morning called together, to this poor hall, his little Roman senate, the leavings of Fassalia, to consult, if he can yet oppose the mighty torrent, the bears down Rome and all her gods before it, or must at length give up the world to Caesar. Not all the pomp and majesty of Rome can raise us, senate more than Cato's presence, his virtues render our assembly awful, they strike with something like religious fear, and they even seize a tremble at the head of armies fust with conquest. Oh, my porches, could I but call that wondrous man my father? Would but thy sister must be prepared to thy friends' vows, I might be blessed indeed. Alas, some pronius, wouldst thou talk of love to Marsia whilst her father's life's endanger, thou mightest as well caught the pale trembling vestle, when she beholds the holy flame expiring. The more I see the wonders of thy race, the more I'm charmed, thou must take heed my porches, the world has all its eyes on Cato's sun, thy father's merit sets the up to view, and shows thee in the fairest point of light, to make thy virtues all thy faults conspicuous. Well, dust thou seem to check my lingering here, in this important hour, thou straight away, and while the fathers of the senate meet in close debate, to weigh the events of war, I'll animate the soldiers drooping courage with love of freedom and contempt of life. I'll thunder in their ears, their country's cause, and try to rouse up all that's Roman in them, to not in mortals to command success, but we'll do more, sampronius, we'll deserve it. Exit. Cousin, that's stricling, how he apes his sire, and bishily sedentious, I'll have wonder old Cypherks come snort. His nomidian genius is world-spoised, and mischief, or he prompt an eager on it, but he must be spurred, and every moment quick into the course. Cato is used in the ill, he's refused his daughter, marshy to my ardent vows, his sides, his beveled arms, and ruined cause, a bath to my ambition, sees his favor, and showers down greatness on his friends, will raise me to rums finest on us, if I give up Cato, I claim in my reward his captive daughter. Cypherks comes, and do Cypherks. Sampronius, all is ready, I've sounded my new Midians, man by man, and find them ripe for a revolt. They all complain aloud of Cato's discipline, and wait, but the command to change their master. Believe me, Sleifex, there's no time to waste, even while we speak our conqueror comes on, gathers drown upon us every moment, alas, then no snazzy's active soul, with what a dreadful course he wretes on from water war, and vain as nature formed mountains and oceans to pose his passage. He bounds all, when they more, will set the victor fundering at our gates. But tell me, has thou yet drawn our young duba, that still would recommend the more to Caesar and challenge better terms? Alas, he's lost, he's lost Sampronius, all his thoughts are full of Cato's virtues, but I'll try one more, but every instant I expect him here. If yet I can subdue those stubborn principles of faith and honour, and I know not what that have corrupted his new Midian temper, and struck the inflection into all his soul. Be sure to press upon him every motive. Duba surrender, since his father's death, would give up African to Caesar's hands, making lord of half the burning zone. But is it true, Sampronius, that your set it is called together? God's, how must be cautious, Cato has pierced in eyes, and will discern our fraughts of us their cupboard thick with art. Let me learn good siphags. I can seal my thoughts in passion, Tisla sureest way, a bellow out for rowing for my country, and mounted Caesar to let shake the Senate. You'll call to boxes a stale device, or worn out trick, which thou be thwart in earnest, plowed they fain zeal and rage in fire in fury. In trough art able to instruct gray hairs and teach the way African deceit. Once more be sure to try they skill and juba, remember siphags we must work in haste, oh think what anxious moments pass between the birth of plots in their last fatal periods, oh to sit dreadful interval of time, filled up with horror all, and big with death, destruction hangs on every word we speak, and every thought to the concluding strokes of determines all, and closes our design. Exit. I'll try if yet I can reduce to reason this headstrong youth, and make him spurn at Cato the time is short. Caesar comes rushing on us, but hold young juba sees me and approaches. Entered to the. Siphags, I joy to meet the thus alone. I've observed of late, I look surfallen, or cast with glimmy carrots and discontent, and tell me, Siphags, I conjure the tell me, what are the thoughts that knit thy brow in frowns, and turn thy eye, thus coldly, undyped friends? There's not my talent to conceal my thoughts, or carry smiles and sunshine in my face, when discontents it's heavy at my heart. I have not yet so much the robin in me. Why does thou cast such ungenerous terms against the lords and sovereigns of the world? Does thou not see mankind fall down before them, and own the force of their superior virtue? Is there a nation in the walls of Africa amidst our barren rocks and burning sands that does not tremble at the Roman name? Gods! Where's the word that sets these people up? A bugger-owned amidias-tony sons, do they, with toughest sinuse bend the bow, or flies the javlin-swifted to its mark, launched from the bigger of a Roman arm? Who, like our active, African instructs the barley steed, and trains him to his hand, or guides in troops the embattled elephant, laden with war? These are the odds my prince, in which your zama does not stoop to Rome. These are virtues of a meaner rank, perfections that are placed in bones and nerves. A Roman soul is bent on higher views, turn up that eyes to cater. There may as thou see to what a God-like height the Roman virtues lift up mortal man, well good and just and anxious for his friends, he still severely bent against himself, and when his fortune sets before him all the pumps and pleasures that his soul can wish his rigid virtue will accept of none. Believe me, Prince, there's not an African that reverses our vast new million deserts in quest of prey and lives upon his bow, but better practices those boasted virtues, course-eye meals, the fortune of the chase amidst the running stream he slicks his thirst. Toils all the day in at the approach of night, on the first friendly bank he throws him down or rests his head upon a rock till dawn, then rises fresh pursuers wanted game, and if the following day he chance to find a new ripest, or an untasted spring, less as his stars and thinks it will luxury. That prejudice is, side-facts, won't discern what virtues grow from ignorance and choice, nor how the hero differs from the brute. Where shall we find the man, their bearers of liction, great and majestic, in his griefs like Keto, how does he rise against a load of woes, and thank the guards that through the weight upon him. Toils pride, rank pride and haughtiness of soul, I think the Romans call it stoicism. Had not your royal father thought so highly of Roman virtue and of Keto's cause, he had not fallen by a slaves-or-hand in glorious. By death thou call my sorrows up a fresh, my father's name brings tears into my eyes. Oh, that you profit by your father's ills. What would Thou have me do? Abandon Keto. Sifax, I should be more than twice and orphaned by such a loss. I, there's the tie that binds you, you long to call him father, master's charms works in your heart unced and plead for Keto. Now, when do you adapt to all I say? Sifax, your zeal becomes important and I've furthered to permitted it to raid and talk at large, but learned to keep it in, lest it should take more freedom than I'll give it. Sir, your great father never used me thus, a last, he's dead. But can you air forget the tender sorrows and repeated blessings, which you drew from in your last farewell? But good old King, at parting run my hand, his eyes bring full of tears, then sying cried, pretty be careful of my son. His grief swelled up so high, he could not utter more. Alas, thy story notes away my soul, that best of fathers, how shall I discharge the gratitude and duty that I owe him. By laying up his counsels in your heart, his counsels, bathe me yield to thy direction, then siphags, chied me in severe storms, vent all thy passion, and I'll stand its shock, common unruffled as a summer's sea, when not a breath of wind, flies or its surface. Alas, my prince, I guide you to your safety. I do believe thou wütst, but tell me how, fly from the fate that follows Caesar's bos. My father's scorn to do it, and therefore died. Better to die, ten thousand thousand deaths than wound my honor. Rather say, you'll love. Siphags, I promise to preserve my temper, I will thou urge me to confess, a flame, a long half stifled, and with fame can seal. Believe me, prince, though hard to conquer love, is easy to divert and break its force. Absence might cure it, or a second mistress might up another flame, and put out this. The glowing dams of Xama's royal court have faces flushed with more exalted charms, where you with these, my prince, you'd soon forget the pale and ripened beauties of the north. Tis not a set of features or complexion, the tincture of a skin, better I admire. Beauty soon grows familiar to the lover, fades in his eye, and falls upon the sense, the virtuous Marcia towers above her sex, true she is fair, oh, how divinely fair, but still the lovely maid improves her charms, withinward greatness, unaffected wisdom and sanctity of manners. Cators so shines out in everything she acts or speaks, while winning maleness and attractive smiles, dwell in her looks, and with becoming grace, soften the rigor of her father's virtue. How does your tongue grow wanting in her praise? Bron, my knees, I beg you, would consider. Ha, south-axe is not she, she moves this way, and with her Lucia, Lucia says, fair daughter, my heart beats thick, I pray the side-facts leave me. Ten thousand curses fasten on them both, now will the woman with a single glance and do what I've been labored in all this while. Exit side-facts, intermarcia and Lucia. Hail, charming maid, how does the beauty smooth the face of war and make even horror smile? Outside of the my heart shakes off its sorrows, I feel a dawn of joy, breaking upon me, and for a while forget the approach of season. I should be grieved young prince to think my presence unbent your thoughts and slackened them to arms, while warm with slaughter our victorious foe threatens aloud and calls you to the field. Oh, Marcia, let me hope, die kind concerns and gentle wishes followed me to battle. The thought will give new vigor to my arm and strength and weight to my descending sword and drive it in a tempest on the phone. My prayers and wishes always shall attend to the friends of Rome, the glorious cause of virtue and men approved by the gods and Keto. The juba may deserve thy pious cares, I'll gaze forever on thy godlike father, transplanting one by one into my life, his bright perfections, till thy shine like him. My father never at a time like this would lay out his great soul in words and waste such precious moments. The reproves are just thy virtuous maid, I'll hasten to my troops and fire thy languid souls with Keto's virtue. If air I lead them to the field, when all the war shall stand range in its just array and dreadful pump, then will I think on thee, oh lovely maid, then will I think on thee, and in the shock of charging hosts, remember what glorious deeds should grace the man who hoops for Marcia's love. Exit-tuba. Marcia, you're too severe. How could you child the young, good-natured prince and drive him from you with so stern and air, a prince that loves and doubts on you to death? Tis therefore Lucia that I chied him for me, his air, his voice, his looks and on a soul, speak also movingly in his behalf, I dare not trust myself to hear him talk. Why will you fight against so sweet compassion and steal your heart to such a world of charms? How, Lucia, wouldst thou have me sink away in pleasing dreams and lose my self in love when every moment Kato's life sits, take? Caesar comes armed with terror and revenge, and aims his thunder at my father's head, should not the sad occasion swallow up my other cares? Why have I not this consistency of mind, who have so many griefs to try its force? Sure, nature formed me of his softest mold and fiebled all my soul with tender passions, and sunk me even below my own weak sex, pity and love by turns oppressed my heart. Lucia disburden all thy cares on me and let me share thy most retired distress. Tell me who raises up this conflict in me? I need not blush to name them when I tell thee their marcia's brothers and the sons of Kato. They both behold thee with their sister's eyes and often have revealed their passion to me. But tell me which of them is Lucia's choice? Suppose to a pausus, could you blame my choice? Oh pausus, thou hast stolen away my soul. Marcus is overwhelmed. His fond complaints have so much earnestness and passion in them. I hear him with a secret kind of horror and tremble at his vehemands of temper. Alas, poor youth, how will I call this raised 10% storms in his afflicted bosom? I dread the consequence. You seem to plead against your brother pausus. Haven't forbid, had pausus been the unsuccessful lover the same compassion would have fallen on him. Or serve a virgin love distressed like mine? Pausus himself of false entiers before me as if he mourned his rivals in success. Then bids me hide the motions of my heart, no show which way turns so much he fears to shed effect that it would have on Marcus. Let us not, Lucia, aggravate our sorrows, but to the gods submit the event of things. Our lives discolored with our present woes may still grow bright and smile with happier hours. So the pure limpid stream when file with stains of rushing torts and descending rain works itself clear and as it runs, refines, till by degrees the floating mirror shines, reflects each flower that on the border grows and a new heaven in its fair bosom shows.

Land of the Burnt Thigh,Edith Eudora Kohl,17817,,"November 20, 2022",[],0,"brevox.org, read by Matthew McNotten. Land of the burnt thigh by Edith Udora-Core. Preface. A word of explanation. I have not attempted in this book to write an autobiography. This is not my story. It's the story of the people, the present day pioneers who settled on that part of the public lands called The Great American Desert, and rested a living from it at a personal cost of privation and suffering. Today there is an infinite deal of talk about dust bowls of prairie grass which should never have been plowed under for farming, of land which should be abandoned. Yet much of this is the land which during the crucial years of the war was the grain-producing section of the United States. Regiments of men have marched to war with drums beating in flags flying, but the regiments who marched into the desert and faced fire and thirst and cold and hunger, and who stayed to build up a new section of the country, a huge empire in the west, have been ignored and their problems largely misunderstood. The history of the homesteaders is paradoxical, beginning as it does in the spirit of a great gamble with the government lotteries with land as the stakes and developing in a close-knit spirit of mutual helpfulness. My own part in so tremendous a migration of a people was naturally a slight one, but for me it has been a rewarding adventure leading men and women onto the land, then against organized interests and finally into the widespread use of cooperative methods. Most of that story belongs beyond the confines of the present book. For thousands of acres today in the west, men and women are still fighting to control that last frontier, and wherever there are farmers, the methods of cooperation will spread for decades. It is a good fight, I hope I shall be in it. E.E.K. Pantices The",Memoirs,English,08:04:08,Matthew McNaughton,[],"['Edith Udora-Core', 'Matthew McNotten']",['the United States'],[],0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Edward III,William Parsons Warburton,28192,2.0,"November 13, 2022",[],0," Read by Pamela Nagami MD. Edward III by William Parsons-Warburton. Introduction Edward III was King of England for a little more than 50 years, having been proclaimed January 24, 1327, and dying June 21, 1377. The backbone of the story of his reign in times is the great continental war. This war, though taxing to the utmost the resources of England and France, and illustrated by many brilliant actions of which our countrymen are still justly proud, was ultimately indecisive and unfruitful in direct results. In its external aspects it was less like an international struggle in which great issues were involved and important principles at stake than one of those splendid tournaments in which this the golden age of shivalry took the light. Preparations are made on a magnificent scale. The contending parties defile under the eyes of a new, mubled eager spectators into the lists, with the blaze and re-of-shield and surcoat, the waving of plume and penon, the Blair of Trumpet and Clarean. Defiances are interchanged, and after many as seromonas delay and passing of harrels to and fro, the champions encounter furiously in the shock of battle. But when one of the combatants has unhorsed his adversary and borne him to the ground, the victor, instead of slaughtering or permanently disabling his prostrate foe, suffer seem to rise and bathe his bruises to call for a fresh horse and lance and renew the contest. At nightfall to complete the parallel, the interrest slackens the combatants to part, the spectators disperse and no more substantial results remain from the splendid and costly pageant, then broken heads and broken lances and reputations lost in one. Nevertheless, though of secondary importance in the history of the time, the war will unavoid a bliakyapai, the greatest amount of space in the following pages, and its leading events, if they do not suggest, at least, fall in with the attempt to distribute the 50 years of the reign into five clearly defined periods of ten years each. The first decade is marked at its commencement by the formal conclusion of a piece between England and France, and it terminates with the opening of the quarrel between the two nations and the completion of the preparations on both sides for war. The second period of ten years opens with the first invasion of France and winds up with the fourth and greatest invasion which resulted in the victory of Klesi and the surrender of Kelle. The beginning of the third decade finds a forced cessation of hostilities throughout Europe in consequence of the ravages of the black death, and its conclusion is marked by the battle of Poetier in the capture of the French King. The fourth period commences with an indirect consequence of the war, the outbreak of the Jacques-Aillien France, and takes us down to the Battle of Navarret, and the reinstatement of the King of Spain by the black prince. The last ten years of the reign are marked by a series of reverses and disasters commencing with the illness of the black prince, his war tax and consequent unpopularity in his French Dutchy, and ending with the loss of almost all the territories which the English had previously possessed or wondering the war in France. The external history of the whole epoch so far as its most conspicuous actors are concerned, thus returns as it were upon itself, and this is equally true of its several portions. At the end of every ten years or so a great and apparently decisive battle is fought, but the general aspect of affairs is scarcely altered by the event. The same negotiations and counter negotiations, the same diplomatic thrusts and parries, the same menaces and crudices are renewed, and after all, we hardly seem to advance a step any more than inner dream towards a practical result. A good deal of this is doubtless traceable to the character of the English King himself. His reign was for a long time, great and prosperous, in spite of extravagant expenditure, short-sighted legislation and vacillating foreign policy. Because by his personal prowess, liberality and splendor, his ready-tact, incestant activity and marvelous good fortune, he carried his people with him, enlisted their sympathy, and commanded their admiration. But unlike his grandfather the great Edward I, he lived and labored for glory and ambition, not for practical or permanent objects. His work and influence were personal and effinescent. O sooner does his vigor begin to decline, and his busy and brilliant individuality to fade away out of the foreground, then disasters of various forms come thronging in, and gradually take possession of the scene. France, though passing through a terrible agony and apparently the greatest sufferer by the long struggle, was in reality the chief gainer in the end. For her kings were guided throughout by a consistent hereditary policy which made them keep the single object in view of extinguishing the half or more than half independent feaves of the crown, and thus consolidating a vast nominal dominion into a compact and united sovereignty. The Emperor II had a policy, quite independent of the dynastic struggle in which he was so long engaged, a policy which brought him into sympathy with the aspirations of the whole German race after social and religious freedom, the development namely of the sources of wealth, entraised, enterprise, and political liberty, and the emancipation of himself and his subjects from the tyranny of the Vatican. He recognized Kindred sentiments in the English people, and at first entered warmly into the English alliance. He withdrew from it in despair only when it became evident. That local jellacies would make it impossible to carry out his project of so combining the power of England and of the Empire as to compel the submission of the Pope and the recognition by France of the claims of Edward III. Charles IV, who succeeded Louis in 1347 and was crowned Emperor in 1354, took no part in European politics. He was in fact a very good ruler of his own kingdom of Bohemia, but he left the interests of the Empire to take care of themselves. The anarchic condition of the far east of Europe began toward the close of this epoch to assume shape and consistency by the growing importance of Moscow and its recognition as a center of national life and national aspirations for tartar Riddin Russia, as well as by the union of the kingdoms of Poland and Hungary under the scepter of Louis the Great. All along that monarchs' southeastern frontier the crescent gleamed, for northern Greece and Serbia and Wallachia were subdued and occupied by the Janissaries of Sultan Amarath I, who had already established the long enduring dominions of the Turk on the ruins of the Roman Empire of the east. On the northern and southern shores of Europe, this was the day of wealthy and powerful trading republics, the rising communities on the Baltic as well as on the Tuscan and Adriatic seaboards enriched themselves by the struggles to the parties themselves worse than on productive, of the greater powers and became the bankers, carriers, pervellers and clotheers of the civilized world. But the main historical interest and importance of the epoch are to be sought below the surface. In the first beginnings of the Great Religious Revolution, which though it broke up the nominal unity of Christendom, conferred on whole nations the ennest themable boon of free access to God and of a faith in harmony with reason. They are to be sought in the parallel advance of popular institutions, commercial enterprise, an original literature. In the decay of feudalism and chivalry, with the simultaneous upgrowth of a great middle class, an a multitude of new ideas and new social and political relations, which in their progress and expansion have largely contributed to the formation and development of the Europe of today. All these points will be touched upon more or less in detail in the following pages, though England will naturally occupy the foreground and her history determine the greater or less amount of prominence to be given to contemporary continental events, and of section one.",Biography & Autobiography,English,09:40:10,Pamela Nagami,"['English', 'French', 'European', 'German', 'Tuscan', 'Adriatic']","['Pamela Nagami MD', 'Louis', 'Wallachia', 'William Parsons-Warburton', 'Battle', 'Turk', 'Navarret', 'Charles IV', 'Riddin Russia', 'Edward III']","['Greece', 'France', 'Kelle', 'Hungary', 'Klesi', 'Serbia', 'Poland', 'the Roman Empire', 'England', 'Empire', 'Clarean', 'Bohemia', 'Moscow']","['Europe', 'Baltic']",5,2,7,0,6,1,2

The extraordinary experiment of Dr. Calgroni by Joseph Fauss and James Bennett-Witting. There is much concerning the queer Dr. Calgroni that I cannot give to the world. It should be remembered that I had never been inside his house until after I beheld him frantically emerge from its big front door that rainy night, his whizzened face as white is death and scantily clad, rush headlong for the depot. That he was a surgeon of extraordinary ability I readily acknowledge. But Belville was the last place where one would expect to find a man of such surgical skill, and most undoubtedly, the last place one would choose for the scene of the startling events brought about as a result of the Dr.'s purchase of the apohorus from Barbers World Famous Three Ring Show. Had the Dr. Mirly put up at the hotel, I might have believed him, like myself, merely summaring at Belville. For it was a restful hamlet situated in a mountainous valley, something like a day's run from New York. But his renting of the Thorin'sdale place aroused latent suspicions in my mind, probably instilled there by that strange article I had read in the surgical monthly. The surgeon of Burahotel or boarding house, but out of the way located, also because of the enormous rent demanded by its ears. The Thorin'sdale place said stood vacant since the last of the Thorin'sdale line had died ten years before. Its doors had been closed in padlock then its windows barricaded. It had been the finest residence in the old town in its day, but was now regarded as a sort of historic oddity. On the whole, it afforded a formidable appearance, crouching behind its great elens, looming huge and weather beaten with its board-shuttered and browning windows. But just the sort of place the eccentric Dr. Calgroni could work in, unmolested. I saw the peculiar doctor one morning as I was leaving the small post office. It was just after train time and many of the villagers were loitering about the place, among them a young man named Jason Murdoch. Murdoch was of that type one always hears of in a small community, the village devil. He came of a good family and had plenty of money in all that, but had succeeded despite rich heritage blood, in igniting more fire and brimstone than all five of the village preachers had in their imagination concede. He was coursely good looking and big and husky. A aristocratic hoodlum though he was, all rather secretly admired the fellow, probably because he injected pep into the lazy old town. I beheld Jason Murdoch pointing to a shriveled up figure of a little man, stooped of shoulder. There he goes, that doctor can groany, who's moving into the Thorndale place. I wonder if there's any good liquor in his cellar. That old Thorne's Dale dump has a good wine cellar. Dr. Calgroni paid not the slightest attention to Jason's insulin battle, but walked hurriedly along his clean shaven dried up countments turning neither to the right nor left. Who is that man? I asked the postmaster who had now come to the door for air. I don't know, accepting his mail as the dress doctor, I'll have to spell it. C-A-L-G-R-O-N-I, and it is mostly for and out of Vienna, forwarded here from New York. Sort of a man of mystery, eh? I hazard it. I should say he's sort of a fool for rent-net-old Thorne's Dale rat trap for God knows what? That stood vacant these ten years. I nodded and left in the direction taken by the doctor. Here was an element of mystery, for I alone of all the villagers knew that this eminent surgeons presence in Belville, boated ill. I soon caught sight of the doctor. For a man of his age and physique, his gate was exceedingly fast, as though propelled by a nervous dynamo. Stretching my legs, I kept a safe distance between him and myself until he swung open the tall wooden gate and quickly vanished through the wilderness of tall bushes and low trees into the Thorne's Dale house. I halted safe from observation and lighted my pipe. Leaning against a tree there, I ran over in my mind the odd significance of that remarkable article I had recently read in the state and ever authentic, surgical monthly. His doctor Calgroni, it appeared, had stated to the interviewer that he was here from Austria on a vacation and to fill out the opinions of American surgeons, a nent his new theory. One Air Von Mijn, a noted surgeon of Vienna, he added with some disparity, had scoffed at the absurdity and an orthodox idea of the unprecedented theory advanced by him and had declared that his Calgroni's operation was extremely impossible, not to save foolish, that it would never be a success. Dr. Calgroni claimed that he could prolong a human life indefinitely, by the insertion of a live by gland, from a young, quadruminous mammal, such as the Pithicoid. Much discussion and argument had been provoked throughout the entire medical world by the famous doctor's theory and consensus was that he was an impractical theorist gone mad. And now here was Dr. Calgroni, living in the quiet little town of Belville, where none was aware of his sensational hypothesis, renting this immense old ramshackle place and his remarkable intent known to know one but himself. I had taken a seat on a tree stump in front of the gate which had a ring stapled to it, used in former days as a hitching post. Time hung heavily upon me in Belville, but this new element of mystery promised some possible interest and excitement. Having sat there until my pipe was empty and cold, I was aroused by the noise of the gate opening behind me, followed by the tap tap of a hammer. I turned. There stood the doctor in his shirt sleeves, tacking a sign to the gate post. Thirdly painted and black on white cardboard I read. Positively no admittance. Anyone entering here does so at his own risk. Tea Calgroni. Without even casting a glance my way, the doctor closed the gate behind him and seemed about to depart up the weed-grown gravel walk, when glancing down the dusky street, he checked himself. My gaze followed the direction of his eyes, a wagon was approaching. It drew up at the stump and halted, loaded with big boxes, the mules were sweating after the poll. Their surly faced driver stopped twenty feet away and turned to the doctor. I know on late, I overheard him grumble, but I handled the boxes carefully as you said. Shall I drive in? You'd better. Returned Dr. Calgroni and Chris Pinguish still not noticing me. And remember, if there's a thing broken, not a scent do you get? When he wheeled up the path. Damn him. Swore the team stir turning to me. Did you ever see such an old crab? Glass inside the boxes? I suggested. The fellow looked at me suspiciously and his lips contracted like a vice and he turned to his mules. I watched him drive through the wagon gate and on up through the moss covered trees to the house. 2. The next morning, I rose early with the intention of strolling past the old, Thorne's Dale Place. I found Main Street lifeless except for two men, busy engaged in posting up the glaring announcement of the coming, Barber's World Famous Three Ring Show. Pauzing, I watched them swab the long multi-hued strips of paper with their pastebrush and sling them upon the billboard. A small crowd of big-eyed youngsters and loafers gradually congregated about the busy circus advance men. The most glaring and conspicuous poster represented two gorillas, peering angrily out from behind the bars of their cave. Beneath it was lithographed in huge red letters, Mimeon Horace, only wild gorillas in captivity. I turned to Lee and momentarily startled, faced what seemed to be one of the gorillas at large, only at war clothes. Gazing at the poster with a look of blank curiosity, was a man short and stature, immense of shoulder and deep of chest, his hair fatching his forehead almost to his bushy eyebrows. He was hideous to look upon. I recognized him though after an instant, as the village half-wit, known as Simple Will. I had seen him before, a poor, weak-minded creature wandering helplessly about the village, pityed, but spurned except when someone needed the help of powerful hands and a strong bath. Dr. Will following the circus man as they started off. I idly strolled down the first street. Then, reaching the outskirts of town, I found myself in the rear of the Thorenzdale Place. To my surprise, I beheld another warning notice similar to the one that Dr. Kelgroni had tacked to his front gate last evening. Not only in one but many places on trees and the high fence, I saw the warning signs of a no trespassing. The doctor himself was nowhere to be seen. A weak slipped by and nothing happened further than gossip concerning the queer doctor. Occasionally, Dr. Calgroni, in person, purchased supplies and called for his mail. Although I can try to be near him whenever possible, he seldom uttered more than half a dozen words and never to me. Once though, I thought I caught him peering surrogately at me in a queer manner. Obviously the doctor was his own servant, Housekeeper and Cook. No one took the risk of entering his place, not even the daring Jason Murdoch. Several days before the circus arrived, I noticed what I considered a peculiarly significant happening. Dr. Calgroni walking toward his abode, with simple will-tacking, dog-like, a few paces behind. At discrete distance, I followed them. Arriving at the Thorin'sdale Place, I was surprised to see the doctor close the gate behind him, leaving will standing outside. The half-wit stood there until Dr. Calgroni disappeared. The day before the show came, I saw the doctor clapping will on the shoulder and talking to it. That night, such a terrible conclusion shaped itself in my mind as to the meaning of the singular boxes, the hostile notices, wills attitude toward the doctor, and the ladders interested him, that it kept me wide awake. In ill humor at myself, I rose at the first appearance of the sun. Remembering the circus, I strolled over to the tracks to watch it unload. Some villagers had gathered about the few wretched travel-scard cars that made up the second rate circus train, and particularly in front of the car, containing the cage of Mimi and Horace. Dr. Calgroni was there, and at his heels, simple will. The doctor was talking very earnestly to the trainer. You say Mr. Barber has offered to sell either of these animals, the doctor was saying as I drew up on the outer fringe of the curious crowd. Yes, sir. He will sell one because they fight continually. They have to be carefully watched or they might kill each other. You don't know what roaches beasts grow as are. The doctor smiled. I would like to talk to Mr. Barber, he interposed. The gorilla trainer hesitated then, pulling shut the sliding doors of the animal car. Sure, just follow me, he said. The doctor, at the man's side, walked to a coach ahead, the combination ticket and executive office of the Barber shows. For an instant, simple will seemed to hesitate, but he didn't trail Dr. Calgroni. The unseen things inside of the gigantic cage nearby seemed to hold his hypnotic attention. Several big drops of rain splashed upon the cinder's dream ground. The heavens hung black and dismal. The sun had completely vanished. I watched simple will. He was ill at ease, hovering un-easily about the gorilla's car. The other people nearby paid no attention to the half-wit. Presently, the trainer and Dr. Calgroni returned accompanied by another man who was counting a role of bills. You say the latter remarked as they passed me, that you aren't horrest delivered at once? Yes, replied the doctor, concisely. All right, hang, call the gang, unload the cage and put horrors in that red single cage. Dr. Calgroni has relieved us of him. At that, simple will approached the surgeon and touched his sleeve. And by hairy animal man, he mumbled. The doctor laid his blue veined and thin old hand upon Will's broad shoulder. Yes, well, and I'm going to give you a job. A job as hits, valid. The showman exchanged winks and from the car rolled an empty iron barred cage. Will's expressionless features twisted into what on his idiot countenance registered pleasure. Dr. Calgroni, back into the man whom I had seen delivered the strange appearing boxes that first afternoon. Got your teen? The fellow nodded. A scene of bustle had sprung up about me and excited and larger crowd of villagers had assembled. The big cage containing many in Horace was lowered to the track side. They were two of the finest animals of their type I have ever looked upon. Horace was transferred to the single cage at its strong door, doubly padlocked upon him. The muelteam drew up with the wagon. Here, will, said the doctor to the half-wit. Climb into the wagon. We're going before we at wet. The doctor appeared highly elated. Simple will, who would stood by as if in a stupor, swung his heavy body up behind the gorilla's cage. No sooner had the wagon drawn out of sight than the heavens seemed to loosen and raft. Rain fell in torrents, driving the spectators in a wild rush for shelter. As I reached the hotel, the water dripping from my drenched garments, the storm increased its fury. All that day it rained, and the next. As I lay on my bed that night and listened to the roar of the wind and rain beating upon the roof and window pains, my mind kept drifting. Sting to the inmates of Thorne'sdale Place. The queer doctor, simple will and his ward Horace, the gigantic gorilla. 3. It was three days later that I learned Dr. Calgroni had wired to New York, and on the next morning an exceptionally well-dressed stranger, whose go-tie bearing in satchel's smack of a medical man, stepped off the train. Despite me, he asked, will you kindly direct me to the Thorne'sdale Place? I told him the best way to reach Dr. Calgroni's without waiting in mud, and he departed with a brief thank you. The next night I saw the stranger, ashen of face and decidedly inwardly shaken, hurriedly purchase a ticket, and leave on the 945 train for New York. Immediately I sought the telegraph dispatcher. You are aware the queer actions of Dr. Calgroni, I should say, he's in nut. I can't say as to that, but to whom did he send the message the other night? You won't let it out, I tipped you off, I solemnly held up my right hand. Well, in a whisper, he wired a hospital for the best surgical man. So the assistant had gone back frightened, and why? Several weeks later, Barber's World Famous Three Ring Show gave a return exhibition at Bellville. That night, I wandered toward the Thorne'sdale Place. Again, the clouds had banked for a storm, fit full rays of the moon now and then shifting through, only to be absorbed in mist. Drawing around in front of the old homestead, looming dark behind the gloom shadowed trees, I seated myself on the stump hitching post. I was glad that in my coat pocket nestled a neat automatic. Why I lingered there in front of the quiet old place, I do not know. Not a light glimmered in the house, not a noise issued from its muffled depths. Then to my ears came a shriek into my startled gaze a light layered in the house. I could dimly see that a figure appeared at its open door. It looked behind it for an instant, then madly bolted toward me. Upon the wet gravel came the tread of rapidly moving feet and the gate in front of me swung abruptly back. In the hazy reflected light, I got one look at Dr. Kel Grooney, who, had and raincoat in his hands, the muscles of his face quivering, his face deathly pale, emerged and turned, running madly toward town. I drew back, automatic in hand, waiting for whatever might follow the doctor. Nothing happened. So bang and impulse, I took out after the fleeing surgeon. Over soggy soil I followed him, around corners down Main Street to the depot. I got there in time to see him swing on the platform of the rear coach of the 945 train bound for New York. Throbbing with excitement, scarce knowing what I was doing, I made my way back toward the Thornsdale Place. Several blocks away I caught a glimpse of a broad shoulder, thick-set, disheveled figure and breech cloud, running, or rather prancing and hopping, toward the circus grounds. The automatic in my hand, I followed. A block from the circus grounds under the street lamp, I saw a figure on horseback that I recognized as Jason Murdock, evidently bound for home. Then snarling, the thing I had seen hopped out from behind a tree trunk on all fours, gaining its hindfeet, it made a flying leap at Jason knocking him from his horse. On the ground they rolled, the powerful Jason hopeless in the thing's clutch. Its fingers closed chuggingly about the man's throat. I tried to shoot, only to find my gun jam, tried to shout and could not. At that instant, the brass band struck up, there'll be a hot time in the old town tonight as the quick dancing strains smote the night air, the thing suddenly ceased in the act of Strangling Jason, looking attentively up. They're seemed to be a responsive obedient look on its horrible countenance. I could see its wild eyes and bearded face, God, it was simple will. Bounding first on all fours, then half upright on his feet, the crazed idiot was making for the showgrounds just as the clouds broke in a downpour. For the rear of the big tent bounded will as the crowds scattered for home. As a familiar with his surrounding, he made for the side show tent in front of which sputtered a gas torch. The crowd, fleeing in the rain, had in the confusion failed to see the half-wit and myself on the mad run, but several men were following me as will tore aside the entrance flats. Inside, poorly lighted though it was, I could plainly see the cage of mimmy, the female gorilla. Her trainer turned at the noise of our entrance and hastily reached for his ninth-pointed pole, but too late. Uddering a cry piercing an antagonistic will flung himself at mimmy's cage, who, with an answering cry of battle, reached both her long hairy arms through her cage, clawing and tearing at the fiercely struggling man on the outside. The trainer rushed in with his prong thrusting at mimmy, for an instant she drew back, then several of us quickly pulled will, bleeding profusely, back from the enraged animal, who again lurched forward as though recognizing in will the reincarnation of her mate porous. Phoming at the mouth will sank limply to the floor. From the hue of the blood ebbong from the side of his neck, I saw at a glance that he was done for. Thammy's claws had severed his jugular vein. Among the men who had helped me thrust the poor fellow out of mimmy's reach was the sheriff of the county. What does this mean? He demanded grasping my shoulders. Follow me, my pride. A crowd of excited men headed by the sheriff and myself made for the Thornsdale place. The light still dimly illuminated the hall through the open door. I'll go in first, sheriff. I offered. If your men surround the place. I stole into the hall, a terrible stench greeted me. I found it came from a door opening out into the hall. A feeble light burned within. About me stood several boxes with the sides torn open and excelled here hanging and strewn about them. Before me, completely assembled in every detail, stood what the boxes had contained, in operating table and all its many surgical accessories. Out of a long box in the corner sprawled the hairy limbs of the fast-dickain Horace, the male gorilla. Taking a small oil lamp from the stand, I turned to examine the dead body, and I noticed the paper, which fell to the floor. A quick look at the side of the beast's head revealed a great gash, rotting at the edges through which it was evident the brain had been removed. I hastily recalled Dr. Kelgroni's theories, could it be my eyes chanced to drop to the floor? Holding forth the lamp, I saw there was handwriting on the bit of paper. I picked it up and read the note, which even at the last stand, Kelgroni had directed to me. Von Mai. Chief disparager of his wild theories. Here Von Mai and Eviana, you said I could not do it. You berated me for my endeavors to alleviate the distress of the insane and feeble-minded. Yet I know now that I have accomplished it, without killing the subject as you claimed to be the result of such an operation. That's why I followed you here to show you. It was successful Von Mai. I could tell by the way his eyes looked into mine when he finally came to. But I could see the brain I had substituted for wills atrophied one was too vigorous. That expression didn't belong to simple will. I am fleeing before he gains his strength. I admit my fear. For after this operation, the former half-wit will be a dangerous customer, with the too vigorous and ferocious brain of the gorilla orus. It is head. End of section one.

The Red One by Jack London. The Red One. There it was. The abrupt liberation of sound. As he timed it with his watch, Bassett likened it to the Trump of an archangel. Walls of cities, he meditated, might well, fall down before so vast and compelling as summons. For the thousands time, faintly he tried to analyze the tone quality of that enormous peel that dominated the land far into the strong holds of the surrounding tribes. The mountain gorge which was its source rang to the rising tide of it until it brimmed over and flooded earth and sky and air. With the wantonness of a sick man's fancy, he likened it to the mighty cry of some titan of the elder world vexed with misery or wrath. Higher and higher it arose, challenging and demanding and such profounds of volume that it seemed intended for ears beyond the narrow confines of the solar system. There was in it too the clamor of protest and that there were no ears to hear and comprehend its utterance. Such the sick man's fancy still he strove to analyze the sound. Sonorous as thunder was it, mellow as a golden bell, thin and sweet as a thramed taught cord of silver. No, it was none of these, nor a blend of these. There were no words nor semblances in his vocabulary and experience with which to describe the totality of that sound. Time passed. Minutes merged into quarters of hours and quarters of hours and a half hours and still the sound persisted. Ever changing from its initial vocal impulse. Yet never receiving fresh impulse. Fading, dimming, dying as enormously as it had sprung into being. It became a confusion of troubled mutterings and babblings and colossal whisperings. Slowly as withdrew, sobbed by sob into whatever great bosom had birthed. Until it whimpered deadly whispers of wrath and as equally seductive whispers of delight. Striving still to be heard, to convey some cosmic secret, some understanding of infinite import and value. It dwindled to a ghost of sound that had lost its menace and promise and became a thing that pulsed on in the sick man's consciousness for minutes after it had ceased. When he could hear it no longer, Bassett glanced at his watch. An hour had elapsed, air that archangels trumped, subsided into tonal nothingness. Was this then his dark tower? Bassett pondered, remembering his browning and gazing at his skeleton-like and fever-wasted hands. And the fancy made him smile. Up child Roland bearing a slug horn to his lips with an arm as feeble as his was. Was it month or years he asked himself since he first heard that mysterious call on the beeched ringmanu? To save himself he could not tell. The long sickness had been most long and consciousness count of time he knew of months, many of them, but he had no way of estimating the long intervals of delirium and stupor. And how faired Captain Bateman of the black-burder, Nauri. He wondered, and had Captain Bateman's drunken mate died of delirium trimmons yet. From which veins speculations Bassett turned idly to review all that had occurred since that day on the beech of ringmanu. When he first heard the sound and plunged into the jungle after it. Sagawa had protested. He could see him yet, whose queer little monkeyish face eloquent with fear. His back burdened with specimen cases, and his hands Bassett's butterfly net in naturalist shotgun, as he quivered in, bished a mare English. He fell at whom much fright, along bush, bad fellow boy, too much stupom along bush. Bassett smiled sadly at the recollection. The little new hand over boy had been frightened, but had proved faithful, following him without hesitancy into the bush in the quest after the source of the wonderful sound. Though fire hollowed tree trunk that, throbbing war through the jungle depths had been Bassett's conclusion. Aronius had been his next conclusion, namely that the source or cause could not be more distant than an hour's walk, and that he would easily be backed by mid-after noon to be picked up by the Nauri's well-boat. That big fella noise no good, all the same devil, Sagawa had a judge, and Sagawa had been right. Had he not had his head hacked off within the day. Bassett shuddered, without doubt Sagawa had been eaten as well by the bad fellow boys too much that stopped along the bush. He could see him, as he had last seen him, stripped of the shotgun, and all the naturalist gear of his master lying on the narrow trail where he had been decapitated barely the moment before. Yes, within a minute the thing had happened, within a minute, looking back, Bassett had seen him trudging patiently along under his burdens. Then Bassett's own trouble had come upon him. He looked at the cruelly heeled stumps of the first and second fingers of his left hand, then rubbed them softly into the indentation in the back of his skull. Quick his had been the flash of the long-handle tomahawk, he had been quick enough to duck away his head and partially to deflect the stroke with his up-flung hand. Two fingers and a hasty scalpel had been the price he paid for his life. With one barrel of his ten-gauge shotgun, he had blown the life out of the bushman who had so nearly got him. With the other barrel he had peppered the bushman bending over Sagawa and had the pleasure of knowing that the major portion of the charge had gone into the one who leaped away with Sagawa's head. Everything had occurred in a flash, only himself, the slain bushman, and what remained of Sagawa were in the narrow, wild pig run of a path. From the dark jungle on either side came no rustle of movement or sound of life. And he had suffered distinct in dreadful shock. For the first time in his life he had killed a human being, and he knew nausea as he contemplated the mess of his handywork. Then had begun the chase. He retreated up the pig run before his hunters who were between him and the beach. How many there were he could not guess? There might have been one, or a hundred, for ought he saw of them. That some of them took to the trees and traveled along through the jungle roof he was certain. But at the most he never glimpsed more than an occasional flitting of shadows. No bow strings twanged that he could hear. But every little while, whens discharged he knew not, tiny arrows whispered past him or struck tree bowls and fluttered to the ground beside him. They were bone-tipped and feather-shafeted, and a feathers tore from the breasts of hummingbirds, iridescent like jewels. Once. And now, after the long laps of time, he chuckled gleefully at the recollection. He had detected a shadow above him that came to instant rest as he turned his gaze upward. He could make out nothing. But deciding to chance it had fired at it, a heavy charge of number five shot. Squalling like an infuriated cat the shadow crashed down through tree ferns and orchids and thudded upon the earth at his feet. And still squalling its rage and pain had sunk its human teeth into the ankle of his stout-tramping boot. He, on the other hand, was not idle, and with his free foot, had done what reduced the squalling to silence. So, a newer to savagery has bested since become that he chuckled again with the glee of the recollection. One at night had followed. Small wonder that he had accumulated such a virulence and variety of fevers he thought, as he recalled that sleepless night of torment, when the throb of his wounds was as nothing compared with the myriad stings of the mosquitoes. There had been no escaping them, and he had not dared to lot of fire. They had literally pumped his body full of poison so that with the coming of day, I swole an almost shut. He had stumbled blindly on not caring much when his head should be hacked off, and his carcass started on the way of sagawas to the cooking fire. 24 hours had made a wreck of him. Of mind as well as body. He had scarcely retained his wits at all, so maddened was he by the tremendous inoculation of poison he had received. Several times he fired a shotgun with effect into the shadows that dogged him. Stinging day in sex and nats added to his torment, while his bloody wounds attracted hosts of loth some flies that clung sluggishly to his flesh and had to be brushed off and crushed off. Once in that day he heard again the wonderful sound, seemingly more distant but rising empiriously above the nearer war drums in the bush. Right there was where he had made his mistake, thinking that he had passed beyond it and that therefore it was between him and the beach of ringmanoo, he had worked back toward it, when in reality he was penetrating deeper and deeper into the mysterious heart of the unexplored island. That night crawling in among the twisted roots of a banyan tree, it slept from exhaustion. While the mosquitoes had had their will of him. Followed days and nights that were vague as night mayors in his memory. One clear vision he remembered was of suddenly finding himself in the midst of a bush village and watching the old men and children fleeing into the jungle. All had fled but one. From close at hand and above him, a whimpering as of some animal in pain and terror had startled him. And looking up he had seen her, a girl, or young woman rather, suspended by one arm in the cooking sun. Perhaps for days she had so hung, her swollen, protruding tongues spoke as much. Still alive she gazed at him with eyes of terror. Pastel p Decided as he noted the swelling of her legs which advertised that the joints had been crushed and the great bones broken. He resolved to shoot her and there the vision terminated. You could not remember whether he had or not. Any more than he could remember how he chanced to be in that village, or how he succeeded in getting away from it. Many pictures unrelated came and went and basits mine to see, reviewed that period of his terrible wanderings. He remembered invading another village of a dozen houses and driving all before him with a shotgun, safe for one old man, two freeble to flee, who spat at him and whine and snarl as he dug open a ground oven, and from amid the hot stones dragged forth a roasted pig that steamed its essence deliciously through its green leaf rappings. It was at this place that a one-toness of savagery had seized upon him. Having feasted, ready to depart with a hind quarter of the pig in his hand, he deliberately fired the grass statue of a house with his burning glass. But seared deepest of all imbasits, brain was the dank and noise some jungle. It actually sank with evil and it was always twilight. Rarely did a shaft of sunlight penetrate its matted roof, a hundred feet overhead. And beneath that roof was an aerial ooze of vegetation, a monstrous parasitic dripping of decadent lifeforms that rooted in death and lived on death. And through all this he drifted, ever pursued by the flitting shadows of the anthropophagy. themselves ghosts of evil that dared not face him in battle, but that knew that sooner late they would feed on him. Bassett remembered that at the time in lucid moments he had likened himself to a wounded bull pursued by planes coyotes to cowardly to battle with him for the meat of him. Yet certain of the inevitable end of him when they would be full-gourged. As the bull's horns and stamping hoops kept off the coyotes, so a shotgun kept off these Solomon Islanders, these twilight shades of bushmen of the island of Guadalcanal, came the day of the grasslands. A burply is if cloven by the sort of god and the hand of god, the jungle terminated. The edge of it perpendicular and as black as the infamy of it was a hundred feet up and down. And beginning at the edge of it grew the grass, sweet soft tender pasture grass. That would have delighted the eyes and beasts of any husbandmen that extended on and on for leagues and leagues of velvet, verduer to the backbone of the great island. The towering mountain range flung up by some ancient earth cataclysm, serrated and gullied, but not yet erased by the eros of trumpet grains. But the grass. He had crawled into it a dozen yards, buried his face in it, smelt it, and broken down an affit of involuntary weeping. And while he wept the wonderful sound at peeled forth, if by peel he had often thought since an adequate description could be given of the enunciation of so vast a sound melding sweet. Sweet it was, as no sound ever heard. Vast it was of so mighty resonance that it might have preceded from some brisen throated monster. And yet it called to him across that leagues wide savanna, and was like a benediction to his long suffering pain racked spirit. He remembered how he lay there in the grass, wet sheaped but no longer sobbing, listening to the sound and wondering that he had been able to hear it on the beach of ringmanoo. Some freak of air pressures and air currents he reflected had made it possible for the sound to carry so far. Such conditions might not happen again in a thousand days or 10,000 days. But the one day it had happened. I've been the day he landed from the nari for several hours collecting. Especially had he been in quest of the famed jungle butterfly, a foot across from wing tip to wing tip, as velvet dusky of lack of color as was the gloom of the roof of such lofty arborial habits that it resorted only to the jungle roof and could be brought down only by a dose of shunt. It was for this purpose that Sagawa had carried the ten gauge shotgun. Two days and nights he had spent crawling across that belt of grass. He had suffered much, but pursuit had ceased at the jungle edge, and he would have died of thirst had not a heavy thunderstorm revived him on the second day. And then it combed a lot of, in the first shade where the Savannah yielded to the dense mountain jungle he had collapsed to die. At first she had squealed with delight at the sight of his helplessness and was for beating his brain out with a stout for its branch. Perhaps it was his very utter helplessness that it appealed to her, and perhaps it was her human curiosity that made her refrain. At any rate she had refrain for he opened his eyes again under the impending blow and saw her studying him intently. What especially struck her about him was blue eyes and white skin. Coolly she had squatted on her hands, spat on his arm, and with her fingertips scrubbed away the dirt of days and nights of muck and jungle that slowlyed the pristine whiteness of his skin. And everything about her had struck him especially, although there was nothing conventional about her at all. He laughed weekly at the recollection, for she had been as innocent of Garb as Eve before the fig leaf adventure. Squat and lean at the same time, asymmetrically limbed, string muscle as if with links of cordage, dirt caked from infancy, save for casual showers. She was as unbeautiful a prototype of woman as he, but the scientists saw, had ever gazed upon. Her breast sat for times that the one time her maturity and youth, and if by nothing else, her sex was advertised by the one article of finery with which she was adorned. Namely a pig's tail, thrust through a hole in her left earlobe. So lately the tailben severed that its raw in-still oozed blood that dried upon her shoulder, like so much candle droppings. And her face. Attwisted and wisened complex of apesh features, perforated by upturned sky open mungolian nostrils, my mouth that sagged from a huge upper lip, and faded precipitantly into a retreating chin. By peering quairless eyes that blinked as, blinked the eyes of denizens of monkey cages. Not even the water she brought him in a forest leaf, and the ancient and half-putured chunk of roast pig could redeem in the slightest the grotesque hideousness of her. When he had eaten weekly for a space, he closed his eyes in order not to see her. Although again, again, she poked them open to appear at the blue of them. Then had come the sound. Never much nearer, he knew it to be. And he knew equally well, despite the wary way he had come, that it was still many hours distant. The effect of it on her had been startling. She cringed under it, with averted face, moaning and chattering with fear. But after it had lived its full life of an hour, he closed his eyes and fell asleep with balata brushing to flies from him. When he awoke, it was night, and she was gone. But he was aware of renewed strength, and, by then, to thoroughly inoculated by the mosquito poison to suffer further inflammation, he closed his eyes and slept an unbroken stretch till sun up. A little later, balata had returned, bringing with her half-dosen women who, unbeautiful as they were, were patently not so unbeautiful as she. She evidently by her conduct that she considered him herfined, her property, and the pride she took and showing him off would have been ludicrous had his situation not been so desperate. Later, after what had been to him a terrible journey of miles, when he collapsed in front of the devil devil house in the shadow of the breadfruit tree, she had shown very lively ideas on the matter of retaining possession of him. In Gurn, whom Bassett was to know afterward as the devil devil doctor, priest, or medicine man of the village, had wanted his head. Others of the grinning and chattering monkey men, all as stark of clothes and beastial of appearances balata, had wanted his body for the roasting of him. At that time, he had not understood their language. If by language might be dignified, the uncouth sounds they made to represent ideas. But Bassett had thoroughly understood the matter of debate, especially when the men pressed and prodded and felt of the flesh of him as if he were so much commodity in a butcher stall. Balata had been losing to debate rapidly when the accident happened. One of the men, curiously examining Bassett's shotgun, managed to cock and pull a trigger. The recoil of the button to the pit of the man's stomach had not been the most sanguine area result, for the charge of shot at a distance of a yard had blown the head of one of the debaters and in nothingness. Even Balata joined the others in flight, and air they returned his senses already reeling from the oncoming fever attack, Bassett had regained possession of the gun. Whereupon, although his teeth chattered with the hagu and his swimming eyes could scarcely see, he held on to his fading consciousness until he could intimidate the bushman with the simple magic of compass watch, burning glass and matches. At the last with due emphasis of solumnity and awfulness, he had killed a young pig with a shotgun and promptly fainted. Bassett flexed his arm muscles in quest of what possible strength might reside in such weakness, and dragged himself, slowly, and totteringly to his feet. He was shockingly amaciated, yet during the various convylicences of the many months of his long sickness, he had never regained quite the same degree of strength as this time. What he feared was another relapse, such as he had already frequently experienced. Without drugs, without even coin-eyed, he had managed so far to live the recombination of the most pernicious and most malignant of malaria and blackwater fivers. But could he continue to endure such as his everlasting query? For like the genuine scientist he was, he would not be content to die until he had solved the secret of the sound. Supported by a staff, he staggered the few steps to the devil devil house, where death and in-gurn, reigned in-gloom. Almost as infamously dark and evil stinkings the jungle was the devil devil house. And Bassett's opinion. Yet therein was usually to be found his favorite crony and gossip in-gurn, always willing for a yarn or a discussion. The while he sat in the ashes of death and in a slow smoke, shrewdly revolved, curing human heads suspended from the rafters. For through the months interval of consciousness of his long sickness, Bassett had mastered the psychological simplicity and lingual difficulties of the language of the tribe of in-gurn and balata. And Evangin, the latter, the Adelhated Young Chief, who was ruled by in-gurn, and who whispered entry had it was the sun of in-gurn. Will the red one speak today? Bassett asked, by this time, so accustomed the old man's gruesome occupation has to take even an interest in the progress of the smoke curing. But the eye of an expert in gurn examined the particular head he was at work upon. It will be, ten days before I can say, finish. He said, never has any man fixed heads like these. Bassett smiled inwardly at the old fellows' reluctance to talk with him of the red one. It had always been so. Never by any chance had, in gurn or any other member of the weird tribe, divulged the slightest hint of any physical characteristic of the red one. Physical the red one must be to emit the wonderful sound, and though it was called the red one, Bassett could not be sure that the red represented the color of it. Red enough for the deeds and powers of it, from what abstract clues he had gleaned. Not alone had in-gurn informed him, was the red one more beast-yield powerful than the neighbor, tribal gods, even thirst for the red blood of living human sacrifices. But the neighbor gods themselves were sacrificed and tormented before him. He was the god of a dozen allied villages similar to this one, which was the central and commanding village of the Federation. By virtue of the red one, many alien villages had been devastated and even wiped out. The prisoners sacrificed to the red one. This was true today, and it extended back into old history, carried down by word of mouth through the generations. When he and Gurn had been a young man, the tribes beyond the grasslands had made a war raid. In the counter-raid, in Gurn and his fighting folk had made many prisoners. Of children alone over five-scored living had been blood white before the red one, and many, many more men and women. The thunderer was another of in Gurn's names for the mysterious deity, also at times was he called the loud shatter, the god voiced, the bird throated, the one with the throat sweetest the throat of the honeybird, the sunsinger, and the starborn. Why the starborn? Invane Bassett interrogated in Gurn, according to that old devil devil doctor, the red one had always been just where he was at present. For ever singing and thundering his will over men. But in Gurn's father, wrapped in decaying grass-mating, and hanging even then over their heads among the smoky rafters of the devil devil house, had held otherwise. That departed wise one had believed that the red one came from out of the starry night, else why, so his argument had run, had the old and forgotten ones passed his name down as the starborn. Bassett could not help but recognize something caudent in such argument. But in Gurn affirmed, a long years of his long life, where and he had gazed upon many starry nights, yet never had he found a star on grassland, worn jungle depth, and he had looked for them. True he had behold shooting stars, this and reply to Bassett's contention. But likewise had he behold the phosphorescence of fungoid growths, and rotten meat, and fireflies on dark nights, and the flames of woodfires and of blazing candle nuts. Yet what were flame and blaze and glow, when they had flameed and blazed and glowed, answer, memories. Memories only of things which had ceased to be, like memories of matings accomplished, a feasts forgotten, of desires that were the ghosts of desires, flaring, flaming, burning, yet unrealized an achievement of easement and satisfaction. When was the appetite of yesterday? The roasted flesh of the wild pig the hunter's arrow failed to slay. The maid, unwelled and dead, air the young man knew her. A memory was not a star, was in Gurn's contention. How could a memory be a star? Further, after all his long life, he still observed the starry night sky unaltered. Never had he noted the absence of a single star from its accustomed place. Besides, stars were fire, and the red one was not fire, which last involuntary betrayal told Bassett nothing. Will the red one speak tomorrow? He queried. And Gurn shrugged his shoulders as, who should say? And the day after, and the day after that, Bassett persisted. I would like to have the curing of your head. And Gurn changed the subject. It is different from any other head. No devil devil has a head like it. Besides, I would cure it well. I would take months and months. The moons would come, and the moons would go, and the smoke would be very slow. And I should myself gather the materials for the curing smoke. The skin would not wrinkle. It would be as smooth as your skin now. He stood up, and from the dim rafters, grimeed with the smoking of countless heads, where day it was no more than a gloom, took down a matting wrapped parcel and began to open it. It is a head like yours. He said, but it is poorly cured. Bassett had picked up his ears at the suggestion that it was a white man's head. For he had long since come to accept that these jungle dwellers, and the midmost center of the Great Island, had never had intercourse with white men. Certainly he had found them without the almost universal, besched a mirror English of the West South Pacific. Nor had the knowledge of tobacco, nor of gunpowder. There were a few precious knives made from lints of hoop iron, and there were few and more precious tomahawks from cheap trade hatchets. He had surmised they had captured and warped from the bushmen of the jungle beyond the grasslands, and that they in turn had similarly gained them from the salt watermen who French the coral beaches of the shore and had contact with the occasional white men. The folk in the out beyond do not know how to cure heads, old inger and explained, as he drew forth from the filthy matting and placed him bassets hands and indibitable white man's head. Ancient it was beyond question. White it was as the blonde hair attested. He could have sworn it once belonged to an Englishman, and to an Englishman of long before by token of the heavy gold circle it still threaded in the withered earlobes. Now your head, the devil devil doctor began on his favorite topic. I will tell you what, basset interrupted struck by a new idea. When I die I'll let you have my head to cure. If first you take me to look upon the red one. I will have your head anyway when you are dead, and earn rejected the proposition. He added with the brutal froneness of the savage, besides, you have not long to live. You are almost a dead man now. You will grow less strong, and not many months I shall have you here turning and turning in the smoke. It is pleasant, through the long afternoons, to turn the head of one you have known, as well as I know you. And I shall talk to you, and tell you the many secrets you want to know, which will not matter for you will be dead. In Gurn, Basset threatened in sudden anger, you know the baby thunder in the iron that is mine. This was in reference to his all-potent and all awful shotgun. I can kill you anytime, and then you will not get my head. Just the same, will Vigngan, or someone else of my folk get it, and Gurn complacitly assured him, and just the same will in the end turn devil-devil house in the smoke. The quicker you slay me with your baby thunder, the quicker will your head turn into smoke. And Basset knew he was beaten in the discussion. What was the red one? Basset asked himself a thousand times in succeeding week, while he seemed to grow stronger. What was the source of the wonderful sound? What was this Sun Singer, this star-born one, the mysterious deity, as beastial conducted as the black and kinky headed and monkey-like human beasts who worshiped it, and whose silver-sweet bullmouth singing and commanding he had heard at the taboo distance for so long. Gurn had he failed to bribe with the inevitable curing of his head when he was dead. Vigngan and Basset and chief that he was was too embezzly, too much under the sway of in Gurn to be considered. Remained Balata, who from the time she found him and poked his blue eyes open to recordessence of her grotesque female hideousness, had continued his ador. Woman, she was, and he had long known that the only way to win from her treason of her tribe was through the woman's heart of her. Basset was a fastidious man. He had never recovered from the initial horror caused by Balata's female awfulness. Back in England, even at best the charm of woman to him had never been robust. Yet now, resolutely, has only a man can do who is capable of martering himself for the cause of science. He proceeded to violate all the fineness and delicacy of his nature by making love to the unthinkably disgusting Bush woman. He shuddered but with averted face hid his grimaces and swallowed his gorge as he put his arm around her dirt-crusted shoulders and felt the contact of her rancid oily and kinky hair with his neck and chin. But he nearly screamed when she succumbed to that caress, so at the very first of the courtship and mode and gibbered and squealed little queer pig-like girly noises of delight. It was too much, and the next he did in the singular courtship was to take her down to the stream and give her a vigorous scrubbing. From then on, he devoted himself to her like a true swan as frequently, and for as long a time as his will could override his repugnance. But marriage, which she ardently suggested, was due observance of tribal custom. He boughed at, fortunately, to boo rule was strong in the tribe. Thus, and gurn could never touch bone or flesh or hide of crocodile. This had been ordained at his birth. Vigngan was denied ever the touch of woman. Such pollution did it chance to occur, could be purged only by the death of the offending female. It had happened once since Bassett's arrival, when a girl of nine running in place stumbled in fellow against the sacred chief, and the girl child was seen no more. In whispers, balata told Bassett that she had been three days and nights and dying before the red one. As for balata, the breadfruit was taboo to her, for which Bassett was thankful. The taboo might have been water. For himself he fabricated a special taboo, only he could marry, he explained, when the southern cross rode highest in the sky. Knowing his astronomy, he thus gained a reprieve of nearly nine months. And he was confident that within that time he would either be dead or escaped to the coast with full knowledge of the red one, and of the source of the red ones, wonderful voice. At first he had fancied the red one to be some colossal statue, like Mimnon, rendered vocal under certain temperature conditions of sunlight. But when and after a war raid, a batch of prisoners was brought in and the sacrifice made at night in the midst of rain, when the sun could play no part, the red one had been more vocal than usual, Bassett discarded that hypothesis. In company with balata, sometimes with men and parties of women, the freedom of the jungle was his fourth re-quadrants of the compass. But the fourth quadrant, which contained the red ones of hiding place, was taboo. He made more thorough love to balata, also sought to it that she scrubbed herself more frequently. Eternal female she was capable of any treason for the sake of love. And though the side of her was provocative of nausea and the contact of her provocative of despair, although he could not escape her awfulness and his dream haunted nightmares of her, he nevertheless was aware of the cosmic verity of sex that animated her, and that made her own life of less value than the happiness of her lover with whom she hoped to mate. Juliet or balata, where was the intrinsic difference? The soft and tender product of ultra civilization, or her beastial prototype of a hundred thousand years before her. There was no difference. Basid was a scientist first, a humanist afterward. In the jungle heart of Guadalcanal, he put the affair to the test. As in the laboratory, he would have put to the test any chemical reaction. He increased his fainte ardor for the Bush woman, at the same time, increasing the imperiousness of his will of desire over her to be led to look upon the red one face to face. It was the old story he recognized that the woman must pay, and occurred when the two of them, one day, were catching the unclassified and unnamed little blackfish, an inch long half-eal and half-scaled, rotund with salmon golden row that frequented the freshwater, and that were steamed, raw and whole fresh or putrid, a perfect delicacy. Pron in the muck of decaying jungle floor, balata through herself, clutching his ankles with her hands, kissing his feet and making slubbery noises that chilled his backbone up and down again. She begged him to kill her rather than exact this ultimate love payment. She told him of the penalty of breaking the taboo of the red one, a week of torture, living, the details of which she yammered out from her face in the mire until he realized that he was yet a tyro in knowledge of the frightfulness the human was capable of wreaking on the human. Yet did Bassett insist on having his man's will satisfied at the woman's risk that he might solve the mystery of the red one's singing, though she should die long and horribly inscreaming. And balata, being mere woman, yielded, she led him into the forbidden quadrant, unabrupt mountain, shouldering in from the north to meet a similar intrusion from the south, tormented the stream in which they had fished into a deep and gloomy gorge. After a mile along the gorge, the way plunged sharply upward until they crossed a saddle of raw limestone, which attracted his geologist eye. Still climbing, although he paused often from sheer physical weakness, they scaled forest clad heights until they emerged on a naked mace or tableland. Bassett recognized the stuff of his composition as black volcanic sand, and knew that a pocket magnet could have captured a full load of the sharply angular grains he trot upon. And then holding balata by the hand and leading her onward he came to it. A tremendous pit, obviously artificial in the heart of the plateau. Old history, the south sees sailing directions, scores of remembered data and connotations swift and furious, surged through his brain. It was Mindana, who discovered the islands and named them Solomon, believing that he had found that monarchs fabled mines. They had laughed at the old navigators childlike crudility, and yet he stood himself, Bassett, on the rim of an excavation for all the world like the diamond pits of South Africa. But no diamond this that he gazed down upon. Rather, was it a pearl? With the depth of iridescence of a pearl, but of a size all pearls of earth and time, welded into one could not have totaled. And of a color undreamed of in any pearl, or of anything else for that matter, for it was the color of the red one. And the red one himself bacett knew it to be on the instant. A perfect sphere, full 200 feet in diameter. The top of it was a 100 feet below the level of the rim. He likened the color quality of it to lacquer. Indeed, he took it to be some sort of lacquer applied by man. But a lacquer to marvelously clever to have been manufactured by the bushfolk. Brighter than bright cherry red, its richness of color was as if it were red, build it upon red. It glowed and iridescent in the sunlight as if gleaming up from underlay under underlay of red. In vain, Belata strove to dissuade him from descending. She threw herself in the dirt. But when he continued down the trail that spiraled the pit wall, she followed, cringing and whimpering her terror. But the red sphere had been dug out as a precious thing was patent. Considering the possibility of members of the federated 12 villages in their primitive tools and methods, Bacett knew that the toil of a myriad generations could scarcely have made that enormous excavation. He found the pit bottom carpeted with human bones, among which battered and defaced lay village gods of wood and stone. Some covered with obscene, totemic figures and designs were carved from solid tree trunks fordier 50 feet in length. He noted the absence of the shark and turtle gods, so common among the shore villages, and was amazed at the constant recurrence of the helmet motif. What did these jungle savages of the dark heart of Guadalcanal know of helmets? Had men donas men at arms, worn helmets, and penetrated here centuries before? And if not, then wince had the bushful caught the motive. Advancing over the litter of gods and bones, balotto wimpering at his heels, Bacett entered the shadow of the red one and passed on under its gigantic overhang until he touched it with his fingertips. No, lacquer that. Nor was the surface smooth as it should have been in the case of lacquer. On the contrary, it was corrugated and pitted with here and there patches that showed signs of heat and fusing. Also the substance of it was metal, the one like any metal or combination of metals he had ever known. As for the color itself, he decided it to be no application. It was the intrinsic color of the metal itself. He moved his fingertips, which up to that had merely rested along the surface, and felt the hold against fear of quicken and live and respond. It was incredible. So light a touch on so vast a mass. Yet did it quiver under the fingertips, caress and rhythmic vibrations that became whimpering and rustling the mutterings of sound. But have sound so different. So elusively thin that it was shimmeringly civilint. So mellow that it was maddening sweet, piping like an elf in horn, which last was just what Basset decided would be, like a peel from some bell of the gods, reaching earthward, from across space. He looked at balato with swift questioning. But the voice of the red one, he had evoked had flung her face downward and moaning among the bones. He returned to contemplation of the prodigy. Although it was, and of no metal known on earth, was his conclusion. It was right named by the ones of old time as the starborn. Only from the stars could it have come. And no thing of chance was it. It was a creation of artifice in mind, such perfection of form, such hollowness that it certainly possessed could not be the result of mere fortuitisness. A child of intelligences remote and unguessable, working corporally in metals, it indubitally was. He stared at it in maize, his brain erasing wildfire of hypotheses to account for this far journeyer, who had ventured the night of space, threaded the stars and now rose before him and above him, exhumed by patient and therpofagy, pitied and lacquered by its fiery bath into atmospheres. But was the color lacquer of heat upon some familiar metal? Or was it in intrinsic quality of the metal itself? He thrust in the blue point of his pocket knife to test the constitution of the stuff. Instantly the entire sphere burst into a mighty whispering, sharp with protest, almost twinging goldenly if a whisper could possibly be considered to twing, rising higher, sinking deeper, the two extremes of the registry of sound threatening to complete the circle and coalesce into the bullmouthed, thundering he had so often heard beyond the taboo distance. Forgetful of safety of his own life itself, and transpired by the wonder of the unthinkable and unguessable thing. He raised his knife to strike heavily from a long stroke, but was prevented by balata. She upreared on her own knees and agony of terror, clasping his knees and supplicating him to disist. In the intensity of her desire to impress him, she put her forearm between her teeth and sink them to the bone. He scarcely observed her act, although he yielded automatically to his gentler instincts and withheld the knife hack. To him, human life had dwarfed to microscopic proportions before this colossal portant of higher life, from within the distances of the cider-real universe. As had she been a dog, he kicked the ugly little bush woman to her feet and compelled her to start with him on an encirclement of the base. Parkway round he encountered horrors. Even among the others did he recognize the sun-shirbled remnant of the nine-year-old girl who had accidentally broken chief Fungan's personality taboo. And among what was left of these that had passed, he encountered what was left of one who had not yet passed. Surely had the bush folk named themselves into the name of the red one. Seeing him their own image which they strove to placate in pleas with such red offerings. Further around, always treading the bones and images of humans and gods that constituted the floor of this ancient charnelhouse of sacrifice. He came down upon the device by which the red one was made to send his call, singing, thunderingly across the jungle belts and grasslands to the far beach of ringmanoo. Simple and primitive was it, as was the red ones, consummate Artvis. A great, king post, half a hundred feet in length, seasoned by centuries of superstitious care. Carvin and to dynasties of gods each superimposed each helmeted, each seated in the open mouth of a crocodile, was slung by ropes, twisted of climbing vegetable parasites from the apex of a tripod of three great forest trunks. themselves carved into grinning and grotesque adumbrations of man's modern concepts of art and god. From the striker king post were suspended ropes of climbers to which men could apply their strength and direction. Like a battering ram, this king post could be driven into onward against the mighty red iridescence sphere. Here was where in Gurn officiated and functioned religiously for himself and the 12 tribes under him. Bassett laughed aloud, almost with madness, at the thought of this wonderful messenger, weamed with intelligence across space, to fall into a bushman stronghold and be worshiped by apelach man-eating and head-hunting savages. It was as if gods were old at fallen into the muck, mire of the abyss, underlying the bottom of hell. As if Jehovah's commandments had been presented on carved stone to the monkeys of the monkey cage at the zoo. As if the sarmant on the mound had been preached in a roaring bedlam of lunatics. The slow weeks passed, the nights by election, Bassett spent on the ash and floor of the devil devalounds beneath the ever swinging slow carrying heads. His reason for this was that it was taboo to the lesser sex of woman, and therefore over refuge for him from balata, who grew more persecutingly and perilously, lovely as the southern cross-road higher in the sky, and marked the imminence of her noctuals. His days Bassett spent in a hammock swung under the shade of the great breadfruit tree before the devil devalounds. There were breaks in this program when, in the commas of his devastating fever attacks, he lay for days and nights in the house of heads. Ever he struggled to come back the fever to live, to continue to live, to grow strong and strong gurgons the day when he would be strong enough to dare the grasslands, and the belted jungle beyond, and went to the beach into some labor recruiting blackbirding catcher, skoener, and on to civilization, and the men of civilization to whom he could give news of the message from other worlds that lay darkly worshiped by beastmen, and the black heart of Guadalcanals midmost center. On the other nights, lying late under the breadfruit tree, Bassett spent long hours watching the slow setting of the western stars beyond the black wall of jungle, red had been thrust back by the clearing for the village. Possessed of more than a cursory knowledge of astronomy, he took a sick man's pleasure and speculating as to the dwellers on the unseen worlds of those incredibly remote sons, de Hauntus, houses of light, life, came forth, a shy visitant from the railis, crips of matter. He could no more apprehend limits to time than bounds to space. No subversive radium speculations had shaken his steady scientific faith in the conservation of energy, and the indestructibility of matter. Always and forever must there have been stars, and surely, in that cosmic ferment, all must be comparatively alike, comparatively of the same substance, or substances, save for the freaks of the ferment. All must obey or compose the same laws that ran without infraction through the entire experience of man. Therefore he argued and agreed must worlds and lives be upenages to all the sons as they were upenages to the particular of his own solar system. Even as he lay here under the breadfruit tree, an intelligence that stared across the starry gulfs, so must all the universe be exposed to the ceaseless scrutiny of a numeral eyes like his, the grandedly different, with behind them by the same token, intelligence is that questioned and sought the meaning and the construction of the whole. So reasoning, he felt his soul go forth in kinship, with that August company, that multitude whose gaze was forever upon the arous of infinity. Who are they? What were they? Those far distant and superior ones who had bridged the sky with their gigantic red iridescent heaven-singing message. Surely, and long since had they to trod the path on which man had so recently, by the calendar of the cosmos, set his feet. And to be able to send a message across the pit of space, surely they had reached those heights to which man, entiers and surveil and bloody sweat, and darkness and confusion of many councils, was so slowly struggling. And what were they on their heights? Had they one brotherhood, or had they learned that the law of love imposed the penalty of weakness and decay? Was strife, life? Was the rule of all universe, the pitiless rule of natural selection, and, and most immediately, and, poignantly, were there far conclusions, their long-wishdoms, shut even then in the huge metallic heart of the red one, waiting for the first earthman to read. Of one thing he was certain, no drop of red do, shaken from the lion's mane of some sun and torment, was the sounding sphere. It was of design, not chance, and it contained the speech and wisdom of the stars. What engines and elements, and mastered forces, what lore and mysteries and destiny controls might be there. Undoubtedly, since so much could be enclosed and so little of thing as the foundation stone of a public building, this enormous sphere should contain vast histories. Profiles of research achieved beyond man's wildest guesses, laws and formulae that easily mastered would make man's life on earth. Individual and collective, spring up from its present mire to inconceivable heights of purity and power. It was times greater gift to blindfold, insatiable, and sky aspiring man. And to him, Bassett, had been boutsafed the Lordly fortune to be the first to receive this message from man's interstellar kin. No white men. Much less no outland man of the other bush tribes had gazed upon the red one and lived, such the law expounded by ingurned to Bassett. There was such a thing as blood-brotherhood. Bassett in return had often argued in the past, but ingurn had stated solemnly no, even the blood-brotherhood was outside the favor of the red one. Only a man born within the tribe could look upon the red one and live. But now in his guilty secret known only to Balata, whose fear of emulation for the red one fast sealed her lips, the situation was different. What he had to do was to recover from the abominable fevers that weakened him and gained a civilization. Then he would lead an expedition back, and although the entire population of Guadalcanal he destroyed, extract the heart of the red one the message of the world from other worlds. What Bassett's relapses grew more frequent is brief, convalescence's less and less vigorous. His periods of coma longer, until he came to know beyond the last promptings of the optimism inherent in so tremendous a constitution, as his own, that he would never live to cross the grasslands, prefer it the perilous coast jungle, and reach the sea. He faded as the southern cross rose higher in the sky, till even Balata knew that he would be dead air the nupsholdate determined by his taboo. Gurn made pilgrimage personally, and gathered the smoke materials for the curing of Bassett's head, and to him made proud announcement an exhibition of the artistic perfection of his intention when Bassett should be dead. As for himself, Bassett was not shocked too long and too deeply had life ebbbed down in him to bite him with fear of its impending extinction. He continued to persist alternating periods of unconsciousness with periods of semi-consciousness, dreamy and unreal in which he idly wondered whether he had ever truly beheld the red one. And for whether it was a nightmare, fancy of delirium, came the day when all myths and cobwebs dissolved. When he found his brain clear as a bell, and took just a praisement of his body's weakness. Neither hand nor foot he could lift. So little control of his body did he have, that he was scarcely aware of possessing one. Lightly indeed his flesh sat upon his soul, and his soul and its briefness of clarity knew by its very clarity that the black of cessation was near. He knew the end was close, knew that in all truth he had with his eyes beheld the red one, the messenger between the worlds, knew that he would never live to carry that message to the world. That message, for opt to the contrary, which might already have weighted man's hearing and the heart of Guadalcanal for 10,000 years. Ambassadored with resolve, calling and gurn to him out under the shade of the breadfruit tree, and when the old devil-devil-doctor discussing the terms and arrangements of his last life effort, his final adventure, and the quick of the flesh. I know the law, O'Hengern, he concluded the matter, who so is not of the folk may not look upon the red one and live. I shall not live anyway. Your young men shall carry me before the face of the red one, and I shall look upon him, in your voice, and their upon die under your hand, O'Hengern. Thus will three things be satisfied, the law, my desire, and your quicker possession of my head for which all your preparations wait. To which Gurn consented, adding, it is better so, a sick man who cannot get well as foolish to live on for so little a while. Also, is it better for the living that he should go? You have been much in the way of late. Not but, what it was good for me to talk to such a wise one. But for the moons of days we have held little talk, and instead you have taken up room in the house of heads, making noises like a dying pig, or talking much, and loudly in your own language which I do not understand. This has been a confusion to me, for I like to think on the great things of the light and dark as I turn the heads in the smoke. It where much noise has less been a disturbance to the long learning and hatching of the final wisdom that will be mine before I die. As for you, upon whom the dark has already brooded, it is well that you die now, and I promise you in the long days to come when I turn your head in the smoke, no man of the tribe shall come into disturb us. And I will tell you many secrets for I am an old man, and very wise, and I shall be adding wisdom to wisdom as I turn your head in the smoke. So a litter was made, and born on the shoulders of half a dozen of the men, Bassett departed on the last little adventure that was to cap the total adventure for him of living. With a body of which he was scarcely aware, for even the pain had been exhausted out of it, and with a bright clear brain that accommodated him to a quiet ecstasy of sheer lucidness of thought, he lay back on the lurching litter and watched the fading of the passing world, beholding for the last time the breadfruit tree before the devil devil house. The dim day beneath the matted jungle roof, the gloomy gorge between the shouldering mountains, the saddle of raw limestone, and the mesa of black volcanic sand. Down the spiral path of the pit they bore him, encircling the sheening, glowing red one that seemed ever imminent to iridescent from color and light into sweet singing and thunder. And over bones and logs of emulated men and gods they bore him, bass the horrors of other emulated ones that yet lived, to the threaking post-tripod and the huge king post-striker. Here, Bassett helped by Ingern and Balata, weekly sat up, swaying weekly from the hips, and with clear, unfaltering all seeing eyes gaze upon the red one. Once o Ingern, he said, not taking his eyes from the sheening by braiding surface, were on and wearin all the shades of cherry red played unceasingly, ever a quiver to change in a sound to become sulk and rustling silver whisperings, golden thrummings of cords, velvet pipings of elphlund, mellow distances of thunderings. I wait, Ingern prompted after a long pause, the long handled tumahawk unassumingly red in his hand. Once o Ingern, Bassett repeated, let the red one speak, so that I may see its speak as well as hear it. Then strike thus when I raise my hand, for when I raise my hand I shall drop my head forward and make place for the stroke at the base of my neck. But o Ingern, I, whom about to pass out of the light of day forever, would like to pass with the wonder voice of the red one singing greatly in my ears. And I promise you that never will a head be so well cured as yours, ingern assured him. At the same time signaling the tribesmen to man the propelling ropes suspended from the king post-striker. Your head shall be my greatest piece of work in the curing of heads. Bassett smiled quietly to the old ones' conceit, as the great carved log drawn back through two-score feet of space was released. The next moment he was lost in ecstasy at the abrupt and thunderous liberation of sound, but such thunder, mellow it was with preciousness of all sounding metals, arcangels spoken it, it was magnificently beautiful before all other sounds. It was invested with the intelligence of Superman of planets of other sons. It was the voice of God, seducing and commanding to be heard. And the everlasting miracle of that inner stellar metal, Bassett with his own eyes saw color and colors transform into sound to the whole visible surface of the vast sphere was a crawl and titillant and vapourous with what he could not tell his color or was sound. In that moment the interstices of matter were his, and the interfusing and intermating transfusing of matter and force. Time passed. At the last, Bassett was brought back from his ecstasy by an impatient movement of ingurn. He had quite forgotten the old devil-devil one. A quick flash of fancy brought a husky chuckle into Barrett's throat. His shotgun labeside him in the litter. All he had to do was to head, was to press the trigger, and blow his head in nothingness. But why cheat him was Bassett's next thought? Head hunting, cannibal beast of a human that was as much ape as human, nevertheless old ingurn had, according to his lights, played square or than square. Ingurn was, in himself, a forerunner of ethics and contract, of consideration, and gentleness in man. No, Bassett decided. It would be a ghastly pity, an active dishonor to cheat the old fellow at the last. His head was in gurn's, and ingurn's head to cure it would be. And Bassett, raising his hand and signal, bending forward his head as a greed, so as to expose cleanly their articulation to his taught spinal cord. Forgot Belata, who was merely a woman, a woman merely an only, and undesired. He knew without seeing when the razor-edged hatchet rose in the air behind him. And for that instant, air the end, their fell upon Bassett the shadows of the unknown, a sense of impending marvel, of the rending walls before the imaginable. Almost, when he knew the blow had started, and just air the edge of steel bit the flesh and nerves. It seemed that he gazed upon the serene face of the Medusa truth. And simultaneous with the bite of the steel on the on-rush of the dark, in a flashing instant of fancy.

Storm Cloud on Deka,E. E. Smith,32850,2.0,"November 17, 2022",[],0,"ox.org. This story performed by Phil Schenavair, Patton Rouge, Louisiana. Storm Cloud On Deca by E.E. Smith. First published in astonishing stories, June 1942. Chapter 1 from A seed. Tellorean pharmaceuticals incorporated. Was civilization's oldest and most conservative drug house. Hyde bound was the term most frequently used, not only by its younger employees, but also by its more progressive competitors. But, comparatively, Tellorean pharmaceuticals did not care. It's board of directors by an ironclad if unwritten law. Was limited to men of over three-score years and ten. Against the inertia of that ruling body, the impetuosity of the younger generations was precisely as efficacious as the dashing of waves against the foot of an adamant-time cliff. And in very much the same fashion. Ocean waves do in time cut into even the hardest rock, and every centriar so. Tellorean pharmaceuticals incorporated. Did take a forward step. However, rather than make a mistake, do nothing was its creed. To that creed, it adhered rigorously. Voss it did not establish branches upon other planets until a centriar so of experiment had proved that no unforeseen factor would operate to lessen the prodigiously high standards of its products. Nor would it own our operate spaceships as did other large firms. Its business was the manufacture of the universe's finest, most carefully standardized drugs, and it would go into no-side lines or whatever. Even the location of its head office directly under the guns of prime base. More out the same theme. Originally it had been in the middle of the city, miles away from the reservation. But has prime base had expanded, the city had moved aside. Tellorean pharmaceuticals, however, would not give way. It stallively refused to sell its holdings even to the galactic patrol. It would not move until the patrol should condemn this property and compel it by law to vacate. Into that massive gray building, their strode atall, lean, gray men, into an old-fashioned elevator operated by a 70-year-old boy, into a darkest severe room whose rock of ages furniture had become pricelessly antique. Without a word, he handed a card to the receptionist, a prime spencer of some 50 summers. Ezekiel R. Stoneley, MD, SCD, consultant in radiation. She read precisely into a communicator by appointment. Let him come in, please. Dr. Stoneley entered the private office of a vice president, a young man as T.P.'s executive's went, a man scarcely 60 years of age. All ready, the consultant reported briefly. Graves is here, you said. Yes, he got in from Dekka last night, how long will the demonstration take? Seven hours to the point of maximum yield, 12 for the full lifecycle. Very good. The vice president then spoke into the communicator. Please ask Mr. Graves to step in. Graves, the manager of T.P.'s branch upon the planet Dekka, planet to graphically speaking, a Dekka North 3, was a short fat man, and he possessed upon the surface at least the fat man's proverbial, genealogy and good nature. Mr. Graves and Dr. Stoneley, mighty glad to be to Dr. Graves, your hands effusively, splendid accomplishment. You've been working on it five years or more, right here, six years and two months, the scientist said precisely. I cannot accompany you, of course, the vice president interposed, visually, and you appreciate that the less of communication or contact hereafter, the better, good day. The two went out, took a cab and soon were in Dr. Stoneley's ultra-private laboratory. It was a large room, artificially lighted, lined throughout with sheet metal, metal which went properly charged, formed a barrier through which no harmful radiation or particle could pass. The scientist snapped down the wall shield and set to work, explaining each step to his visitor. Here are the seeds, for the present, you will have to take my word for it that I produce them here. I will go through as many cycles as you please. Here are the containers, a miniatures you will observe, the standard hydroponics tanks. The formula of the neutral solution, which, while of course, crucial, contains nothing either rare or unduly expensive. I plant the seed, thus in each of the two tanks. I cover each with a bell jar of plastic, transparent to the frequencies to be employed. I enclose the hole with a similar envelope, so I align the projectors, thus, we will now put on our armor as the radiation is severe and the atmosphere which displaces our own of oxygen, synthetic or imported graves asked. Imported, synthesis is possible, but prohibitive in cost, importation in tank ships is easy, simple, and comparatively cheap. I will now energize the projectors and growth will begin. He did so, and in the glare of blue green radiance, the atmosphere within the bell jars, the very ether, warp and ride, in spite of the distortion of vision, however, growth could be perceived, growth at an astonishing rate. In a few minutes the seeds has sprouted, in an hour, the thick broad glossy green leaves were inches long. In seven hours each jar was full of a lushly luxurious entangle of foliage. This is the point of maximum yield, only remarked as he shut off the projectors. I assume that you won't want to take a sample. Certainly, the fat man agreed, how else, when I know which the clear quill, if you were a scientist, the sight of it would be sufficient, came the dry rejoinder. Knowing that you were not, however, I am running too tight as you see, take either one you like. Six days, six generations, six samples, and even the immanently skeptical graves was convinced. You certainly got something there, Doc. He admitted, finally. We can really go to town on that. You're absolutely sure that you're covered, no trace? None, whatever, stone to you, sure him. Dr. Stoleney will retire and will gradually drop from sight. I will abandon this disguise, resume my true identity as fair child, which has been kept alive judiciously, and move openly to Deca. Notes, data, possible observers, this machine re-instuff, grave insisted. No notes or data have ever been written down. The knowledge exists only in my own brain. You are the first person other than myself ever to see the inside of this room. This apparatus will be unrecognizable before it is boxed, and I shall do the packing myself. Why? Are you by any chance apprehensive that I base-slip up? Well, we can't be too sure. The fat man's blue eyes were now neither genial nor good-natured. They were piercing and cold. In this game anybody who permits any leaks dies, and anyone who knows too much dies. We don't want you to die, at least until after we get started on Deca. Nor then, the scientist interrupted, cynically, if you know when you're well off. Time the only man in the universe who can run the apparatus. It would take a mighty good man three years to learn it after I get it going. Remember that, my friend. So what grave stare was coldly level? Just so you don't develop any funny ideas. I know as well as you do however, about leaks and leakers. I don't leak. How long will it take you to get ready? Three months? Just about. And you? Anytime. Make it three months then. Three months it is on Deca. The interview was indicated. Newspoke originally newspaper came. Was the largest city of Deca-Nore three. It lay in the broad valley of the spoken river just above the mouth of Clear Creek, which later streamed me and grow along a fertile valley between mountains, lofty and steep. Clear Creek valley, all of it, and all its neighboring mountains belonged to Tolorean pharmaceuticals incorporated. The valley floor was a riot of color devoted as it was to the insensitive cultivation of medicinal plants, which could not as yet be grown economically in tanks. Along both edges of the valley extended rows of huge hydroponic sheds. Upon the mountain sides there were snake dins, lizard pins, and enclosures from many other species of fauna. Nor was the surface all that was in use. Those mountains were hollow, honeycombed into a host of rooms, in which under precisely controlled environments of temperature, atmosphere and radiation, were grown and studied hundreds of widely variant forms of life. At the confluence of Creek and River, just inside the city limits, they are reared and sprawled the company's buildings. The processing and synthesizing plants, the refineries, the laboratories, the powerhouses, and so on. In a ground floor office of the towering administration building, two men sat in silence and waited, while I read light upon a peculiarly complicated dashboard, faded through pink into pure white. All clear? This way, doctor? Manager graves pushed a button, and a section of blank walls slid smoothly aside. The fat man and doctor, a fair child, unrecognizable now is the man who had once been known as doctor stonly, went down two long flights of narrow steps. Along a dimly lit corridor, they made their way through an elaborately locked steel door, then into a barely furnished steel line room, on the floor of which four inner bodies lay. Graves thrust a key into an inconspicuous orifice, and a plate swung open, revealing a shoot into which the four lacks forms were unsurimoniously dumped. Then the two men retrace their steps to the manager's office. Well, that's about all that we can feed into the disintegrators, fair child lit an al-Sackenite cigarette, an exhaled, thoughtfully. Why? Going soft on us? Graves sneered. No, the scientist replied calmly. The ice is getting thin. What do you mean thin? The manager demanded? The patrol inspectors are hours enough of them anyway. Our records are fixed, fake identity, trips, all that stuff. You know? Everything's on the green. That's what you think, fair child, counterit cynically. Our accident, right? In spite of everything we have been able to do, is up 300th of 1% industrial hazard rate and employee turnover about 3.5. And an narcotics division alone knows how much we have up to total bootleg sales. Those figures are all in the patrol's files. How can you give such facts the brush off? We don't have to. Graves laughed comfortably. Even a half of 1% would not excite suspicion. And our distribution is so uniform throughout the galaxy that they can't center it. They can't possibly trace anything back to us. Besides, they wouldn't suspect us. With our reputation, other firms would get knocked off in time to give us plenty of warning. Lutz and Schiffers, for instance, is putting out her own by the tongue. Again, I say that's what you think, fair child remained entirely unconvinced. Nobody else is putting out the stuff that comes out of cave 217. Demand and price prove that. What you don't seem to get graze is that some of those damned linsmen have brains. Suppose they put Warsaw of Valencia, the tragan sea of right or four, or even can't even himself onto this job. Then what? The minute that anybody decides to run a rigid statistical analysis of our records, we're done. Ah, this was a distinctly disquieting thought. In view of the impossibility of concealing anything from a great linsman who was really on the prowl, that might not be so good. What would you advise then? Shut down to 17, and preferably the whole Hush-Hush end, until we can get our records absolutely honest, and our death rates down to the old time 10 year average, the scientist insisted. And that way only can we make ourselves really safe. Shut down the way we're pushing us for production? Graves sneered. You talk like a fool. The chief would toss us both down the shoot and put somebody else in here that would really produce. Oh, I don't mean without permission. Talk him into it. It's best for him as well as everybody else over the long pull. He couldn't see it. I can't eat or really, grunted the manager. If we can't dope out something better than that, things have got to go on as is. I suspect it's so, but you asked me. The next best thing is to use some new form of death openly explainable to cleanup our books. Wonderful. Graves snorted contenturously. What can we possibly add to what we are using right along? A loose atomic vortex? Wush. The fat man deflated in an exclamation of profound surprise. Then came back up for air gasping. Man, you're nuts. There's only one on the planet and it's......or do you mean......but nobody ever touched one of those things off deliberately? Can it be done? Yes. It isn't simple, but we fellows of the College of Radiation know how, a theoretically. The transformation can be made to occur. The fact that it is a new idea makes it all the better. It has never been done because it has been impossible to extinguish the things. But now, storm cloud is putting them out. I see, neat, very neat. Graves' agile and cunning brain was going over the possibilities. Certain of our employees, I take it, will be upon a picnic in the upper end of the valley when this unfortunate occurrence is to take place? Exactly. And enough mythical ones to straighten out our bookkeeping. Then later, we can dispose of suspects as they appear. Vortices are absolutely unpredictable, you know? People we don't like can die of radiation, or of any one of a mixture of various toxic gases and vapors and the vortex will take the blame. And later, when it gets dangerous, storm cloud can blow it out for us. Graves clotted. But we'll not want him for a long, long time. No, but we'll report it and ask for him the hour it happens. Fairchild, silence the manager's exposculations. Use your head, Graves. Anybody who has a vortex go out of control once it killed as soon as possible. But here's the Joker. Flowed is enough class a prime urgent demand on the file right now to keep him busy for the next 10 or 15 years. Therefore, we won't be able to get him, see? I see. This is nice, fairchild. Very nice. But the head office is better keeping all your eyes on cloud, just the same.

Loom and Spindle,Harriet H. Robinson,42244,2.0,"November 16, 2022",[],0," in the public domain. For more information or devalentier, please visit Librevox.org. This recording is by Michelle Fry, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in June 2022. Introduction. Whenever the history of economic conditions in this country shall be written, the author will express his gratitude for all the works, giving the details of a special epics and phases of industrial life. Among them he will find no more interesting experience than that attending the entrance of women to the industrial field. The author of Lume and Spindle contribute something more than her personal experiences at Lume during the early years of the textile factories. She contributes an inside view of the workings of a new system of labor, which had been transplanted from England, and which originated with the application of power to spinning and weaving. The attractions of good wages and comfortable environment were the inducements held out by American manufacturers at Lle to secure a class of operatives which should bring success to their experiment. The prejudice against the male operatives, as shown by investigations in England, would otherwise have delayed the establishment of the factory in America, that is, the factory is controlled by a central power. With the attractions offered, it was natural that the women of New England should accept situations as weavers, spinners, etc. in the great textile works, but they brought with them their educational and religious training. And as they were grouped together, it was natural also that they should continue the cultivation of their minds, especially under the broadening influences of mental contact. It is this aspect of the factory system to which Mrs. Robinson has addressed herself. It was an experience in which she took part. She saw it all and was part of it. She with her associates, chief among whom were Harriet F. Curtis, a writer who attained an enviable position. The career sisters, Mrs. Chamberlain, Eliza Jane Kate, Harriet Farley, the sculptor's Margaret Foley, Lydia S. Hall, Lucey and Emily N. Larkham, Sarah Shed, my first teacher and others, who became well known in literary, benevolent and other walks in public life. Gave character to the early factory days in New England, which are usually referred to not only as unique in their features, but for the purpose of supporting the idea that modern conditions are not as attractive and that there has been a thorough deterioration, not only in the people employed in the factories, but in their home life. Something of this note is sounded in the last chapter of this book, yet it must be recognized that the factory system has been and is a power in civilization, a factor in developing it in truth. The factory girl of the early period was not degraded through her employment or her surroundings. She stepped out of factory life into professional or semi-professional occupations. She was succeeded by a class originally beneath her, the members of which have in their turn graduated from the factory and stepped into higher callings. This process has been repeated, the destiny of the factory being ever to reach down and lift people up out of lowly into higher conditions. This gives the surface appearance of deterioration when the real fact is that through the factory, the lower orders, so far as mental capacity is concerned, are being constantly elevated. The author sees this, yet naturally cannot help regretting that the heterogeneity of the factory population natives coming from many lands with differing social ideas, with little or no training, with few opportunities for advancement, with low earning capacity and with varied languages, has changed the atmosphere or the factory community. The human lives involved are worth more in this atmosphere than they were in the quad-ish labor out of which they have risen. Lume and Spindle, valuable as it is for its details of economic history, for the inspiration which comes from studying the lives and characters of noble women, teaches the lesson which the author and her associates taught that whatever is honest and employment is in the service of God. Their lives emphasize the fact that the modern system of industry has exercised a wonderful influence in securing intellectual stimulation and in identifying every honest calling. Carol D.

Cordelia the Magnificent,Leroy Scott,6368,,"November 13, 2022",[],0,"ore information or to volunteer, please visit Leavervox.org, read by Don Sutton. The four young women at the table in their secluded corner, all about 22 or 23, made a group such as any illustrated Sunday supplement of a New York paper, would have been exaltantly proud to have starred in the very center of its page of society beauties. Small wonderband that the people at the other tables, in the big restaurant of the Grand Thumb Hotel, still glances at these four favorites of fortune. pointed them out to friends less well informed and gave gossipy facts in the eager, subdued whispers. They had known each other all their lives had these four said the gossipy whispers. Had gone to the same school, had been deputy-tons in the same season, had always done everything together. That one there, the vivid sparkling beauty, with glinting reddish brown hair, and with that pleasant confidence smile, which showed that she was equal to anything, that was Miss Cordelia Marlo. Best known of the four, the most striking figure in society's youngest set. Didn't she really look everything that people in the papers, said of her? Didn't she look that name, which it somehow fascinated itself to her? Cordelia, the magnificent? Just look at her! Didn't she? The others? That spirited brunette? Across from her was Miss's Jack-1 Thorn-Dike, who smart wedding two years before to marry Thorn-Dike was still being talked about. And that vivacious little blonde was Mrs. Elaine Hartness. whose husband was that Peter Hartness, who was just now making us sensational splurge down in Wall Street. And that proud looking girl, if she were arrogant, wouldn't any girl be so in her position, was Miss Corda's north? A north in these many years, and in her own right, the rich is girl of the group. And one of the richest erasers in America. But, one to look at was Miss Marlo. Was she a beauty? I'm just looking at her. Couldn't you just see why she was so popular? So undeniably a leader in her own brilliance, that? Cordelia sends very well the substance of what these tables were whispering about her. She was accustomed to being admired, to being talked about, not only by a mixed crowd such as Phil de Grattem, but by her own great world. So the good here in Smile, over off-picked-shoed face, did not change into this present admiration, the face of her mind puckered into a ride twisted smile at the irony of this situation. How very differently these people, and all the people who knew her, are new of her, would talk when they learned all the facts. That morning, when the thing was fresh upon her, Cordelia's days' impulse had been all for breaking this lunch and engagement. Jackie Gladys and Elaine even though they had long looked upon her as the leader, could easily have handled all matters relating to the fifth reunion of the class of 16, a fashionable hardcore hall. But Cordelia had wanted to see Jackie her roommate at school, and closest friend during the years since then, until Jackie, confidentially, the superfying, the unbelievable thing that had just be fallener. And being here, such was her controller herself. She was out of the charming cameras, pleasantly confident Cordelia her friends had always known. All through the lunch and the four girls, nicknamed in their first year at Harcourt, the faithful floor, had chatted about this and that interrupting each other with the license of old friends. But it was not until after the fingerballs were before them, that they really settled to the business that had brought them together. Of course, the biggest thing we've got to do is to pick the chairman for the classroom union, said Jackie's own life. We know the person we want, and the person the whole class will want, Cordy Margo, and she's practically promised to serve. We're all agreed on that, yes? Of course, if we'd air pick anyone else, Cordy of course agreed to us, no worse. Then it's all settled, declared the bris Jackie, and since that's about all the real business we have, I'm afraid it's not settled, strongly interrupted Cordelia. I suppose I should have told you before, but I didn't know the thing myself much before this. The fact is, I'm not going to be at the reunion. Not be there, the three correspond to Spain, then Jackie demanded, what's the matter, Cordy? Why not? Cordelia's good humored, pretty small, did not change, except that there was now a convoking hint of mystery in it. I've suddenly changed all my plans, she answered, change your plans, Cried A-Lean, how? I'm not telling you just now, say Cordelia's still smiling. You'll all know all about my plans in a few days. Wait till then, you must have something big on Breeve Jacqueline. They did not question her further. They knew from all that there was no use quizzing Cordelia, when she announced she would give no answers. But they sent mystery here, perhaps romance. Certainly something big, as Jackie had said, certainly a surprise. Cordelia read what was passing in their minds, and again, she smiled her eye in her smile. They would be surprised all right, but what a different surprise from anything they might be imagining. But I say Cordy, gladest nor worth first out in the sentence, sir. You promised to come out to my place right after the classroom union and stay for the summer. Your new plan isn't going to interfere with that. I'm sorry, gladest, but I'll have to call that visit off altogether. But Cried, when I'd planned, what is it anyhow that you're up to? Cordelia was still smiling. It's just as I said, gladest, I can't say any more just now, and you'll know everything in a few days. There was a moment of surprise silence on the part of Jackie and Aileen. What is having asked Cordelia out to rolling meadows and Cordelia having accepted? Here was something else to wonder about. There was no further questioning of the smiling, adding magical Cordelia about her ulcer plans, and the business of the committee of the fifth reunion of the class of 16 of Hardcore Hall went on and was quickly finished. The matter of the chairman was settled by the insistence that Cordelia accepted the nominal championship, which Jackie is by his chairman, who would be prepared to assume all duties in case Cordelia really could not appear. Gladest and Aileen then departed on shopping expeditions. And at last Cordelia had her worshiping a little with Jackie. You certainly sprung a lot of surprises on a cordial deer, began Jackie. You didn't tell me a thing you don't want to, particularly about your change plans. But Gladest asked me to come out to that big place of hers. That was certainly a jolt. Why, since she came back from France two years ago, with her steps as during that French war orphan, the two of them adopted, Gladest hasn't had a soul out to see her. That's exactly why she asked me where to and Cordelia. I don't know all Gladest's reasons, of course. She said her keeping to herself so much since she came back from France, was the effect on her over two or three years of war working hospital of that count as depressing. So that's it. The way she's heard to herself and behave generally has had me guessing. Gladest said she now believe that her keeping out of things have been bad for her. And from now on, she was going to entertain a lot. She put it up to me as a favor as that she wanted me out at rolling medals to help put life into things. She certainly could not have asked anyone who could do the thing better to clear Jackie. I keep a lot of guests and proper spirits. Your world beat it. Your what might be called social insurance cordy. And certainly Gladest needs someone with that awful temper of hers and her conceit. Both Gladby diversed out any time. But her picking you cordy with her always having with jealous of you and especially just now with the two of you. I guess I don't have to say that cordy. I suppose you're referring to Jerry Pumpen. Jerry Pumpen? Yes. I spoke straight out to Gladest about that when we were all out at your place last week. We had a bit of a row and she'd flare it up about Jerry. Just as nice as I could, I told her there was no sense in our fighting about Jerry Pumpen. I said I wasn't saying it in a light jerry or the she light jerry and the she light jerry like either of us. That was pretty much his own affair and I guess he'd make up his mind to suit himself. And I told her that if he made up his mind that he liked her and if she liked him I'd be right there saying, God bless you my children. I went on and sent a lot more things all along the same line. How did Gladest take it? You know how gladest is when she has a good impulse it's a swift-ness or tamper. She broke down since she'd always resented me because people liked me. That's why she's been so nasty. Since she had lots of acquaintances but no girlfriend, not a real girlfriend and how she did need a girlfriend she could depend on. It also did might be sincere. That was when she asked me to come and stay with her. Perhaps Gladest was sincere for that moment, so Jackie skeptically but even so she was unconscious they taking a little Gladest and if she wants a real girlfriend one that she can depend on how about the stepsister of hers. The little I've seen a best or steep and she's always seemed to me a mighty decent sort and the two used to be getting along together well enough for them to go to Paris the month after Gladest graduated to work in the hospital of the Countess's Cresse. I said much the same to Gladest. Her explanation was that there was too much difference in their ages for them to be real friends. I don't believe her. Gladest is 22 or 23 and her stepsister is only five or six years older. There's some other reason. I'll lay you a little bit on that and that's for you, Cordy. She's as she out because she thought she could use you and I'll bet it all has something to do with Jerry Plumpton. Her deal is still worth a smile. Whatever Gladest's real reason has made it been for asking me I guess they don't make much difference of present since I'm not going out to visit her. Suddenly Jackie's hands looked across the tablecloth and the green grape Cordylius rust. Speaking of Jerry Plumpton, she breathed there coming out of the growroom. Cordylius slightly turned her head. Jerry Plumpton's course lay past their table but as she had, he had not seen them. He was 29 or 30 tall well-built with hybrid, handsome features and easy confidence in his every movement. All together, and outstanding figure in any company. Since the death ten years earlier of his mother, who had admittedly been the social amperes of New York City, there have been no more important question to ambitious mothers with Queenie daughters than whom Jerry would select as his consort to try to fill in her younger way but place untented in society since his mother's death. And likewise, fill the great house on upper fifth avenue, the new port house and the other plumpton places. Jerry cited them and bore down upon their table with a negrous smile. The greeting was that of old friends. If I didn't have a confounded business engagement with my lawyer, he grumbled pleasantly, I'd invite myself to sit with you for a while. If you did, I'd have to tell you you couldn't stay. Your turn cordelia. For I'm having right now a confounded business engagement with Jackie. His gaze fixed on cordelia. That's as to me, like in order to hurry along. All right cordelia? But are we seeing you tonight at the grasslands? I'm sorry Jerry, but I won't be able to make it. I was going to fall in you. She had promised him several dances for that night and his face showed keen disappointment. Well, if you can't, you can't. But I'm not to see you till that little party we've arranged for Friday night. I'll not be able to make that either Jerry. I've just changed all my plans. Change your plans he exclaimed in one way. She regarded him with her same easy, unperturbed smile. I can't tell you just yet Jerry, but you'll know all in a few days. Puzzled, Jerry went on his way. He should have seen how the people in here were looking at you and Jerry while you were talking, whispered Jackie. All of them included me were saying just one thing. What a stunning couple, don't make. I'm backing you with all I've got against Gladys. And I, if I had anything to bet return cordelia, would put it all on Gladys. Jackie stared at this. I wish those few days you mentioned were over, so I could know what all this business is about. You won't have to wait Jackie. My chief reason for coming here today was to get the chance to tell you it once what it's all about. Despite the privacy of their corner table, Jackie leaned far across and gazed breathlessly at our old roommate. Yes, she whispered. He must promise not to repeat a word of what I tell until it all becomes public. You can count on my promise, cordy. Here goes then. First of all, so you'll understand the full meaning of the thing. I'd better remind you how poor we are. These last 10 years since father's death, mothers had a mighty heart of time to keep things going with lily in me on her hands, and only a little over 30,000 years to do it all on. That's for that, I guess things weren't a lot better when my father was alive. Or even in my grandfather's day. We Marlos never did have much money. Everybody knows you have a much money cordy. That doesn't make any difference with such a family as the Marlos. It's enough for us all that you're just cordelia Marlos. There's not another girl who has your standing, your popularity, who gets the invitation you do. Cordelia, smile, Riley. Have humorously. Perhaps you've never guessed the Jackie by my popularity has been part of my capital. Those invitations are a large part of my income. A weekend party, a yachting party, I guess that this house for a week, that house for a month, I'm always booked up. I'm a successful guest. I work hard at being a guest. That's been my business. Don't talk like that, Cordy. Everyone's always tickled to get you. I suppose they have been. At least I've tried to please. But if I hadn't taken my living expenses off mother's hands in this way, I don't see how mother could have managed at all these last five years. So much for that. Now come to the present situation. Here it is all at once Jackie. For wiped out Jackie, utterly finished. Finished? I've got Jackie in what way. And every way. You mean especially, especially money? If we haven't any money at all well, I guess money includes everything, doesn't it? Cordy, how did it happen? No use bothering you with many details. It's a common story anyhow. I'll bet that never before that so many families go on the rocks as in this awful year of our Lord 1921. I didn't know anything about our mass to last night. The mother and I had a long session, and she told me something she'd been keeping from me. With a high prices since the war, she founded her in harder to live on our income. Result, she kept drawing on her capital by selling up bonds. Results of this was that the income from her remaining bonds was so inadequate as to make her feel they were hardy worth keeping. She saw only one chance. Desperate, she decided to sell the bonds and speculate. Mother picked out oil. And everything's gone. Everything, cordy? Everything except a $2,500 annuity from one of my father's life insurance policies? Mother said she tried to borrow. But nobody, not even old friends, would loan us such hard times without the best security. And of course we haven't that. All-known money, cordy, thanks, you're a dear, Jackie. If it were a small amount, I'd take you up. But nothing less than 30,000. And 30,000 every year would be worthwhile. I wouldn't take them much from you, even if you could spare it. Cordy. Cordy what will it mean? Is it not pretty plain? As my mother put it last night, it means that the marlos, one of the best families for generations, must necessarily sink out of their world into poverty and digi of security. I'm sorry, it's for Lily. She's only 15. And once I've entered her cord hall in September, but now Lily will never have a chance. That's for myself. Well, now you see why I can't be chairman of our classroom union. Why I'm not going out to cloud as snore worse. Why I'd back cloud as against myself so far as Jerry Plump in his concern. I'm out of my old world. Out of your world. Out of their world. Out of their forever. Cordy, breathed the day's Jackie. Cordy, my God. Cordy still tried to smile into Jackie's staring face. But nonetheless, she was feeling something of the poignant dismay that her pastor and dazed her when her mother had broken the news of the family disaster. She knew no other world except this into which she had been born. She loved it. And now she had lost it. She had indeed been a social star. And now all of that glory was lost. She liked Jerry. Subconsciously, all her important plans had been basing themselves upon the growing possibility of being Mrs. Jerry Plumpton. And of having this blended position that would belong to his wife. And now she was out of his world. Their past would never cross. Now all that was lost. I guess she realized now what it means, Jackie, Cordyly said mechanically, then she added, The only reason for keeping the thing secret is my mother's wish. She feels the disgrace and is crazy to avoid it. Mother said that since the rent for our apartment is paid in advance until the first of July, it would be cheaper for us to live on there than any place else. She hopes there may be some kind of a chance that something may still turn up. And if something does, then the world will never know what's happened. She wants to keep the thing quiet on that chance. Jackie nodded, By you, Cordy, what are you going to do? I thought it all out, and the only thing is for me to go to work. Work! Jackie was scarcely less horrifying and sympathetic than at Cordyly's original announcement. Cordyly, a marital, go to work. And then Jackie's face lit up. And might not be so bad after all, Cordy is something new. It might be an awful lot. What are you going to do? That's what I'm wondering about. Though I've not yet had time to do any real thinking. I'll tell you what, Jackie cried inspiredly. Let's have a look at the want columns of a newspaper. They tell me one can find everything in these one at. For the moment of vivacious Jackie had forgotten the seriousness of the situation, and was seeing the affair as an exciting adventure into an unknown country. So when the waiter sat down Cordyly's eyes tea, and her own horses neck, she ordered him to bring in a newspaper. Jackie quickly swallowed two inches from her tall glass. A little something from the hippo peptis, both since the fops so I can do some heavy thinking she whispered, and drew a super flask from her handbag and filtered glass to the brim. This she stirred with a long spoon and sift her reinforced beverage. Ah, that's something like, she's eye. Somehow my booze tasted a lot better these days since they've told me I can't have it. The waiter returned with a newspaper, and the next moment with the two of them were scanning the columns headed help wanted female. They finished these please for assistance and regarded each other globally. It was Jackie who spoke before the beach. How monotonous. Nothing wanted but cooks, made, scrub women, nursemates, stenographers, and still more cooks and mates? Not a thing that's in your line. No. So I'm alternately their eyes fell upon an adjoining heading. Positions wanted female. I can't Jackie had an inspiration. I say, cordy? Why don't you put in a wand at for a position? My dark court was always saying you were the best harcroft hall ever turned out. And my peat just the thing. They slamed cordelia, then she asked, advertising to do what? Well, well, you're a wonderful dancer, you know. But not good enough to be a professional on this stage. And I don't know how to be a teacher. And I don't think I'd like to be one either. Well, there's your swimming, same answer, Jackie. I don't know any girl who can sail above better than you. Same answer again. There's your tennis. Don't some tennis clubs have professionals. The same is golf clubs. Not women professionals. There's no money in tennis for me. You're a regular whiz that driving a car. I've been in your roachster when you were coaxing over 90 an hour out of it. How much demand is there for a woman so fur? Or should I say so cute? And with my record for a rest, who would take me on as a careful family driver? Well, but here, Jackie came to a pause. I guess you get all of my situation now, Jackie. Yes, Jackie says slowly, you're broke and you've got to earn money. You've got every accomplishment, but you can't do a damn thing that's useful. Not a damn thing that you can sell. That's exactly my situation, Jackie. And as you just said, Miss Harcourt used to call me Harcourt Hold Best. The two looked at each other solemnly, even gloomy for a long moment. But Miss Miles started on Jackie's peacant face as slowly became a challenging grin. What's up now, Jackie? I dare you to do it. Do what? I'll tell you in a minute. Party, we've been following the wrong line. How? And trying to compete with these people. Jackie excitedly tapped the want calls. They all either want to buy or sell the common place, the useful. What are some people, often most eager to get pay big money for? Uncommon things that are not useful. Diamonds for instance. Beginning to get the idea? I'm beginning to get excited. Go on. Don't advertise yourself as a lump of coal. Advertise yourself as a diamond. There's my idea? I dare you. A reckless gleam at flushed into Cordelia's eyes and she left into the two girls had come the spirit of hold. Again, there were a couple of wild, harem, scaram girls, hashing in this capetit with his harcourt. I'll not back down on a dare. Cry to cordelia? I'll advertise. What I'll tell the exact truth? The more truth is better. Will not waste any time getting busy on this. Here, use the ass in this paper as a sample and dictate to me. I'll write the thing on the back of this menu card. I'm all set and now shoot. Loughing at the absurdity, the dare double-tray of the enterprise. So much akin is fear was the thing to one of their school day lards. Cordelia began to dictate. After elaboration, condensation, vision, a frequent reference to the newspaper for the proper form that completed one at on the back of the menu card, Red is follows. American girl 23, strong considered good looking, best social standing, experts at swimming, writing, tennis, dancing, and can drive racing car. Has other accomplishments, but no useful training. Desires position with adequate remuneration. What have you to offer? Jackie summoned a waiter and paid the bill. Just so you won't have a chance to re-nag courty, I'm going to take this right over to the times and pay for it. Come on. Loughing cordelia followed Jackie out of the hotel and over to the time's office. Or Jackie copied the advertised when upon the blank provided and handed it in. The clerk counted the words added R113 times and handed Jackie a slip of paper. This Jackie gave to Cordelia. There is your lottery ticket all dear, R113. Sounds like a lucky number. The clerk said you might have a bunch of replies by Wednesday morning. You must tell me what happens. Jackie, you dear fool, you nothing is going to happen. You just wait and see, prophesied Jackie, but even Jackie did not guess what a good prophet she was.

"U.S. Marine Operations in Korea, 1950-1953, Volume 2: The Inchon-Seoul Operation",Lynn Montross; Nicholas Canzona,37271,3.0,"November 16, 2022",[],0," All Libravox recordings are in the public domain. For more information or volunteer, please visit Libravox.org. The Inchan Landing was a major amphibious operation, planned in record time and executed with skill and precision. Even more, it was an exemplification of the fruits of a bold strategy executed by a competent force. The decision to attack at Inchan involved weakening the line against enemy strength in the Busan perimeter in order to strike him in the rear. It involved the conduct of an amphibious attack under most difficult conditions of weather and geography. The stakes were high and the risk was fully justified. Had it not been for the intervention of the Chinese Communist Army, the offensive generated by the Inchan attack would have resulted in a complete victory for our arms in Korea. A study of the record of this operation will disclose with the resting clarity, the decisive power that has to be found in highly trained amphibious forces when their strength is applied at the critical place in time. Lamule C. Shepherd Jr. General, US Marine Corps, Comedant of the Marine Corps. Preface This is the second volume of a series dealing with United States Marine operations in Korea during the period two August 1950 to 27 July 1953. Volume 2 presents in detail the operation of the first Marine Division and the first Marine aircraft wing as a part of 10 core, US Army, during and immediately following the Inchan landing on 15 September 1950. In order to tell a complete story of this historic amphibious operation, the authors have described the mobilization of the Marine Corps reserves to form the components of the division and aircraft wing. The movement to the staging area and the hurried planning for an amphibious landing. The withdrawal of the first provisional brigade and Marine Air Group 33 from the embattled Pusan perimeter to amalgamate with the larger force for D-Day at Inchan. The seizure of soul and its invariance, and finally the withdrawal on 7 October to prepare for the Wansan operation. Again, this is primarily a Marine Corps story. Activities of other services are presented in sufficient detail only to set this operation in its proper perspective. Great full acknowledgement is made for the valuable information furnished by the scores of officers and men consulted by interview or letter and for the assistance provided by the current history branch of the Office of the Chief of Military History Department of the Army.

The White Dove,William John Locke,18268,,"November 12, 2022",[],0,".org. The White Dough by William John Locke, Chapter 1. Father and Son. Life is a glorious thing, said the girl. So Vester Leonid looks at her half an amusement, half an blissfulness. There was no doubt whatever of her sincerity. Therein laid the pathetic. To reply that the shadow of death and suffering clouded life's glory was too obvious a rejoinder. So he smiled and said, well, we ought to concrete make it our own and live it to the fool. If it is to be conquered by us weak wretched, it can't be such a glorious thing, he remarked. But who said we were weak wretched, she retorted, you're not one and I'm not one. She laughed, flushing on it all. No, I'm not, she repeated. In Professor Lannion had been in doubt with the power of graceful words, he was a chance for a pretty compliment. It was challenged by the girl's self-conscious glance, and by the splendid vitality of her youth. For inner defrees, usually carried the air of a conqueror with a certain sweet influence. Some such idea passed Vady through his mind, but unable to express it, he said shifting his ground lonely. You see, I'm getting elderly. Not since, she said, you're only five and thirty, my own age to a day. I don't quite follow, said he. A woman is always ten years old than a man, you ought to know that. And that proves that you ought to go into the world and win fame and mix with the brilliant men and women in London who can appreciate you. I don't want to mix with more brilliant men and women than those who are under this roof of woodlands, said Zilvester. Ella flushed again, but this time she dropped her eyes and bent her head over her sewing for some time abandoned. A smile played right her lips. Your aunt Agatha, for instance? No, Dsl, the other two. He rose and felt his pipe from a tobacco jar on the mental piece. The rum furnished with the solid behogany and leather of a bag on generation, was his father's particular den, where, however, of all rums in the house, he was least likely to find the privacy for which he was set apart. Ella, joining her periodic visits to Aresford, calmly monopolised it. So Vester strolled in naturally from his widowed house over the way. Miss Agatha Lannion, although she pretended to cough at the smoke, would leave her knitting, promiscuously about on chairs and tables. While the little grandchild Dorothy spilled the ink with impunity over the turkey carpet. The was a silence while Sevester lit his pipe and settled down again in the net an armchair by the fire. I want no better company than the dear old man's and yours, said he. My conversation is not fit for an intellectual man, said Ella, with the humility that contrasted with her conquering attitude of a few moments before. You are a very clever girl, said Vester. She shook her head with a little hand of a scorn and threw her say on the table. How, no, if these have not been added to think so, but what do I know in comparison with you? Or can I do? You go to bedside and hold the keys of life and death in your hand. To you, all the hidden forces of mistress of nature are everyday common places. Professor Stuntall of Vienna, whom I met the other day at Lady Milnose, told me that if you chose, you could become the greatest bacteriaologist in Europe. Did he say that? Oh, Sevester, eagerly. Yes, and that is why you ought to go her way and live in London and fulfill your life gloriously. I look of amusement came into his grave eyes and did from him at the somberness of a face prematurely care-worn. I am going to London, he said, I sold the practice this morning. Ella rose from her chair in Petruzdy. Why didn't you tell me at once, instead of letting me say all these silly things, just like a man? You took my apathase so much for granted, said he, laughing. I suppose I am a weak red shaft or all, said Ella. So Vester put down his pipe and stood by her side. It is ready all you're doing, Ella. This is not the first time you pointed out my way to me, and it went beyond the last with it. There was a no-to-pathetic appeal in his tone that made her heart beacuse little faster. Of all the phases of his manhood that are instinctive feminine alertness to cause him to present to her, this one moved her the most strongly. And I am wanted shy tenderness came into her eyes. It is for you to settle that, she said. It looked at her from members of about to speak, but some inward conflict seemed to check the words. A man's memories and dead lovers rise up sometimes and stare at him in sad reproach. I wish I had the gift of speech, he said. What do you want to say? She asked gently. He smiled whimsically. If I could tell you that, I should have the gift. You let me see something of you in London, weren't you? Oh, of course, who else should I want to see? Frotchum's practice is a large one. I am buying a share, you know. A specialist generally has his hands full. I shall have neither the time nor the desire to go about butterfly. Besides, it is only a few people that like me. I am generally looked upon as a stick. He's had it been turned aside. And while there had been no danger of his glance, Ella had scant his face as a girl does that of a man who is already something more to her than friend or brother. It was thin and intellectual, somewhat care-born, with deep vertical lines between the brows. The hair was black and wavy, thinning a little over the temples, the features well cut and sensitive. The eyes deeply sunken possessing keenness but little brilliance. And a star shestanding well-awaited gent from the cheeks, accentuated their sharp contours. It is part of the intellectual dedication of the face, the tanned rough skin, corresponding with the well-knit whirinous of his frame, gave assurance of strong physical health. The last epithet in his remarks, served variants with the character she was idealizing from her scrutiny, moved her ready indignation. I should like to have a quarter of an hour with the fool that said so, she explained. You are loyalty or friends, sits or vester. They discuss the point. Ella let loose the fine score on a 5 and 20 for the shadow society that could not appreciate a man of his caliber. Her championship was sweet for him to hear. For some time past, he had been gradually growing conscious of the force that this sympathetic intelligence and this warm nature were bringing into his life. I am wittyly, he'd revealed the fact to Ella. As woman and especially the fresh girl, his responsive and gives bit by bit of herself as it is creved, Ella went he looked into her heart, found much more than I had been yielded. The situation therefore was sweet and delicate. My going will be a blow to my father, he said after a while, I hardly liked to tell him. He wouldn't stand in your way, said Ella. He's not like that. We've talked it over scores of times. He's his anxious desire for you to take your proper place in the world. Dear Alfredo, said filvester, his face frightening. He may cut off both his feet for me gladly, but he would feel the pain all the same. Yes, who wouldn't love him, said Ella. I wish I had a father. Will go share his and him, said Silvester. His heart is big enough. And again the girl colored and felt very happy as if the puzzle of her life were being explained to her. And Dorothy, that's where the difficulty comes in. Would London be good for her? Why not leave her here? Ella looked him sharply and saw as she'd expected the alarm on his face. You don't know what she is to me, he said. It would share on cometh you when you're gone, he is devoted to her. He was silent a while. The thought of parting from the child, the living memory of his dead wife, was a parent whose intensity he could not express even to Ella. She was seven. For four years he brought her up alone in his own house, under the care of an old family servant to a daughter to read and say her prayers and use her knife and fork in a way befitting her station. The rest of her tiny education, so vester himself had seen too. She was his constant companion, a broad and at home. He could talk to her as it was in his part too. To know when else, almost persuading himself that her innocent clear eyes saw into the depths of his heart. To leave her behind was a prospect filled with unspeakable dismay. It's a weary world, he said, by way of generalisation. It isn't, right Ella? It's a glorious world full of love and heroism and beauty. I won't have my dear world abused. It is sweet to be alive in it to use all one's faculties to go about among men and women to hear the rain, to smell the hay, and get hay fever, and then come to me the missing throat to cure you. Piganism generally ends that way. I should call you or be able to cure me a very beautiful thing too. She explained conclusively. Is it your knowledge of healing a glorious thing? I don't tell me about the child gathering pebbles by the seashell. Or, it was modesty on Newton's part, but mock modesty on that of the people who wrote him now. Jordan can pick up a tremendous lot of pebbles in 200 years. The door opened, a Matthew Lannians stood on the threshold, with an amuse smile on his grave face. For the garnermin speaking with animation, and the fresh colour in her cheeks and the happiness in our eyes made her goodly to look upon. So, overnight later, the usual, the asked coming forward. I hope so, he went be converted on comethy, what do you think of the world? Isn't it a beautiful world? Since it holds you, my dear, how could it be otherwise? She laughed and looked at so vests with some cockatry. He was a listening compliment by which he might profit. So, Vester thrust forward and I'm chair for his father. Tard? No, of course not. What does a healthy man got to do with being tard? Now, my dear Ella, please don't, in spite of his approval cushions, therefore the young and dead of it. Where shall we have tea, Arztella? Here, or in the drawing room? Our dagger through is in her district. Oh, here then, by all means, we can have it comfortably. At around the bell and clear to an occasional table of a litter of pipes, cigar boxes and papers. Matthew Lannon laid back in his chair with the air of a man who'd earned his home comforts, and stretched out his feet to the far. Then he put his a variable question. How's Dorothea? So Vester replied, get the usual politenist to our health, recounted the small incidents in the child's day. She driven with him on his rounds that morning. During one of the waitts at urgently requested pick, the coachman, to die forth with, straight and stiff, those she might have the pleasure of seeing how her father brought him to life again. How might it be much exercised by picture in the family Bible of the raising of Jaris's daughter, and had identified her parent with the chief actor in the scene? T arrived during the duration. Matthew listened with a muused interest for his son and his son's child with the Darius things earthheld for him. His wife had died many years ago when Savester was just emerging from boyhood and the great glory had gone out of his heaven. But his love for Savester had deepened, and of late years the sad parallelism of their widow lives had drawn the two men that in year together. In many ways there was singular in here like, the mere facial resemblance to them at the first glance as father and son. Both were grave, intellectual looking men, of the same clean, warrior-made, with an air reserve and good-breeding that command in respect. But the old of amperesess that peculiar grace of manner, called nowadays of the old school, which the brusker habits of more modern times have forbidden to flourish. Both faces bore the marks of suffering, but the passage of the years had chasened that of the father, who looked more frankly at the world than the son and out of kindly a gray eyes. He was at a level of sixty, his hair whitening fast, still he held himself erect and scoffed satirically at old age. The prime of life, my dear sir, he would say, the heyday of existence. Up to sixty, a man gathers his experience and tears his fingers dreadfully. After sixty, he could sit down quietly and enjoy it and let his fingers heal. There was a port on the talk, and the three sat as they often did, content to be together, looking into the far and thinking their own thoughts. Perhaps the girls were the happiest. The room had darkened, and the far light played on their faces gathered around the half. Suddenly, so Vester spoke. I was talking to Ella about my plans father before you came in. A very sensible person to talk to, said Matthew. I've burned my ships, I've sold the practice and I'm going to join Froggerman London. I'm very glad indeed to hear it, so the old man, he should have done it years ago. His voice was swarve and even, but the keen eye of the physician detected a trembling of the fingers resting on the broad leather of the arm of the chair. I don't at all like to leave you, since Vester, feeding guilty. Matthew waved away the reluctance. Nonsense, my boy, I'm not a crumpled that requires to be taken to care of. I've gone up men can't be forever hanging on to. I was going to say to each other's apron strings. Not in is your place. Perhaps after a time when I'm dead and gone, a man must die someday, you know. You're like to come back to the old house and devote your seven tarditor and research and be independent of two kidney fees and that kind of thing. There would be nice wouldn't it, Ella? The girls half throbbed the chair implied, but a tender of feeding quarts it at once. It would be impossible to relate to you, Uncle Matthew, she said. He rose with a laugh. None of us are indispensable, but even the most futile. I'm going to dress. You'll die in here, of course, still. And Ella told them to get up some of the 84-pomerate to drink good luck to still. He walked out of the room with a brisk hair of a man thoroughly pleased with life. But outside in the passage, his face grew sad and he mounted the stairs to his dressing room very slowly, holding onto the bedesters. The younger folks remain for a while longer in the library. So vests have bent forward and broke a great lump of coal with the poker. I'm not fit to black his boots, you know. My companionship meets much more to him than Dorif is does to me and he gives it up without a murmur. And that settles the Dorif's equation? Arceder? In the direct manner that sometimes embarrassed him? Of course it settles it, he cried warmly. What a selfish beast he must have thought me. If you didn't love others so warmly, I shouldn't. She came to a dead stop because his eyes were full upon her. Well, I shouldn't care for you so much. Do you care very much for me? He asked rather whistfully, and came to where she was standing with one foot on the fender. You know why we do anything on the world you asked? She answered in a low voice. Some day I may claim your promise. You know I always keep my promises, she said. The dressing bell clang loudly through the house, so vests are hurriedly departed serves to dress in time for dinner. But had I linger by the far, the girl in her wondering whether she had said too much, and the woman in her field with the delicious pity for the strong-brained, deep natureed man who seemed dumbly to beholdy art his hands for her love. She gave it generously and gratefully. Compare with him, all other men seemed of small account, and in her aunt laid in Elmos house, where most of her life was spent, she'd seen all the sorts and conditions of males that a well-to-do collector of might as a member of his can gather around her in London. But to her direct mind, the truest man of her acquaintance were, Matthew Lianyan, a former garden whose title of uncle was purely one of courtesy, and saw vester, with whom the old quasi-cousinary relations were being transmitted into sweet at eyes.

Poems of Emile Verhaeren,Emile Verhaeren,45781,4.0,"November 17, 2022",[],0,"omain. For more information or to volunteer, please visit Librivox.org. Emil Faharim remarkable among the brilliant group of writers representing Young Belgium, and one who has been recognized by the literary world as holding a foremost place among the lyric poets of the day, was born at Saint Amond near Antwerp in 1855. His childhood was passed on the banks of this health, in the midst of the widespreading flamish plains, a country of mist and flood of dikes and marshes, and the impressions he received from the mysterious melancholy character of those surroundings, have produced the marks and lasting influence upon his work. Yet the other characteristics with which it is stamped, the wealth of imagination, the wonderful descriptive power and sense of colour, which sets the landscape before one as a picture, suggest rather the possibility of Spanish blood in the poet's veins. Faharim entered early in life upon the literary career. After some time spent at a college in Hent, he became a student at the University of Luvá, and here he founded an edited journal called Lassaman, in which work he was assisted by the singer Van Dyke, and by his friend the publisher Edmont Demont. He also formed about this time, a close friendship with Matalink. In 1881, Faharim was called to the bar at Brussels, but soon gave up his legal career to devote himself entirely to literature. In 1883 he published his first volume of poems, and shortly afterwards became one of the editors of Lámo Déan, to which, as well as to other contemporary periodicals, he was for many years a contributor. In 1892 he founded with a help of two other friends, the section of art, in the house of the people, a popular institution in Brussels, where performances of the best music, as well as lectures upon literary and artistic subjects we're given. In spite, however, of the work which all this entailed, and of the many interests created by his ardent appreciation of the various branches of art and literature, Faharim continued to labor and ceasingly at his poetical work. He has now for many years ceased to live in Brussels, and spends his winters in Paris, and his summers that his country house in Belgium, which bears the quaint name of Cayouki Bique, and lies near the French frontier by Mo Bourge. Between the year 1883 and the present time, he has brought out the following volumes. Léfleau Mond, Lémoang, Lé Soar, Lé De Barcl, Léfleaumbau Noir, Lé Zaparoud, Mé Chumang, Lé Campagne, Halucine, Lé Village, Lévis, Tentaculère, Lézer Claire, Lévisage de la vie, Léfourse, Tumultures, and L'Amultieple, Splendor. So these must be added for dramatic pieces, Lézobe, Philippe de Helendesparte, and Le Clattre. This, the finest of the dramas, was written 15 years ago, but we have only recently had the privilege of seeing it on the London stage. Throughout this entire series, the intellectual and spiritual development of the poets may be traced, from the more materialistic tone which marks his earliest work, and the pessimistic emotional strain, the throws of a soul in revolt against fate, which are so powerfully portrayed in Lé De Barclut and Léfourse-Mau Noir. The tender, serene mysticism which characterizes the later poems of Lé Zaparoud, Mé Chumang, and the wonderful sympathy with nature, even in her sadist aspects. The subtle power of endowing those aspects with a profound and unknowbling symbolism, which distinguish the beautiful poems named, Lé Village Lézobe. These are a clear, is the title of a volume of love songs, an exquisite record of golden hours spent in a garden at springtime. In his later volumes, and especially in Lamal-Tiplis-Brandur, Faharan yet further unfolds the spiritual ideas, which he has drawn from his contemplation of nature of her butas and all that she symbolizes, and over the human element so ardently working out its development upon her field. I learned to know, he says, that beauty in all its expressions was what awoken me the loftiest ideas, and that the supreme beauty was to be found in man. And so I feel that my earlier nature poems are destined, as it were, for a background on which to paint my higher vision, the progress of man towards the ideal life. In style, Faharan is the apostle of the very libera, and his handling of rhyme and rhythm, his cleaning of words where he finds the French vocabulary and adequate, are both daring and suggestive. He has undeniably forged a rare and powerful weapon of poetic eloquence, and shows a wealth of imagery, a depth of thought, and a subtlety of expression, which could not have been imprisoned behind the bars of a rigid convention. English readers have been much accustomed to by their own poets to the very libera, and it is not so much therefore, for my adherence to this form, as for my failure to adequately render Faharan's peculiar and striking beauty of language that I beg their indulgence for the following translations. To make a typical selection from a poet's work is always difficult. In this small volume, first published some years ago, the field of selection had been limited to the three volumes of what's maybe called, Faharan's middle period, and we are now able to add only three of the later poems, as a new edition seems called for immediately. At this moment, when the interest and sympathy of the whole world are centered upon the tragic sufferings of Belgium, the vividness of the pictures here presented of the silent Flemish planes, the pittilous rain, the long dikes wrapped in a mist, the lonely wind swept villages, the blazing bell-free, must indeed come home to us all with poignant force. For not only are they fitting background for the Belgian peoples unatturable woe, but they are also the surroundings among which are own men are in the throes of their life and death struggle. The symbolic meanings which the poets attaches to many of these pictures will be felt with no less force. The first impression is one of Siden Jorans, but I am glad to remember that in later pages of this volume the sun breaks through, and that's glorious St. George, with his special message to English hearts, brings a note of good cheer to all militant spirits.

Masters of the Vortex,E. E. Smith,37886,1.0,"November 11, 2022",[],0,"vox.org. Read by Harley James. Master of the Vortex by EE Smith. Chapter 1. Cattastrophe. Safety devices that do not protect. Uncinkable ships that before the days of Burgham home and a vitomic and cosmic energy sink into the waters of Earth. More particularly safety devices which, while protecting its one agent of destruction, attract magnet-like another and worse, such as the armored cable within the walls of wooden house. It protects the electrical conductors within it against accidental external shorts, but in and out quickly grounded it may attract an upon occasion has attracted this tremendous force of lightning. Then steel armor exploding into incudestence inside walls and ceilings, that house is existence thereafter as to be measured in minutes. Specifically for lightning rides. The lightning rides protecting the Chromium glass and plastic home of Neal Cloud. These rides were adequately grounded with copper silver cables the size of a big man's forefinger. For Neal Cloud, Dr. of Neuclinics knew his lightning and was taking no chances whatever with the safety of his wife and children. He did not know, did not even suspect. That under certain conditions of atmospheric potential and of ground magnetic stress, his perfectly designed and perfectly installed system would become a super powerful attractor for flying vortices of atomic disintegration. So now Neal Cloud neclonices set his desk in a strained ol' apathy. His face was a yellowish gray white, his tendon hands gripped rigidly the arms of his chair, his eyes hardened lifeless, stared unceingly, past the small, three-dimensional block portrait of all that had made life worth living. For his guardian on against lightning had been a vortex magnet. At the moment when some loxless white had tried to abate the nuisance of a loose atomic vortex. That white dies, of course, they almost all is dead. And the vortex instead of being destroyed was simply broken up into a number of widely scattered new vortices. In one of those bits of furious uncontrolled energy, resembling a handful of substance torn from a depths of a sun, darted toward and sought downward to earth's or kneel clouds new house. The house did not burn, it exploded. Nothing of it in it or near it stood a chance. For in the few seconds the place where it had been was a crater of seething boiling lava, a crater which filled the atmosphere with poisonous papers, which flooded all nearby space with lethal radiations. Cosmicly the whole thing was infinitesimal. Ever since man learned how to use atomic power, the vortices of disintegration had been breaking out of control. Such accidents had been happening and would continue to happen. More than one world perhaps had been or would be consumed the last gram by such loose atomic vortices. What of that? Of what real importance are a few grains of sand to a pile 5,000 miles long, 100 miles wide and 10 miles deep. Even to that individual grain of sand called earth or in modern parlance, sol 3 or telas of soul, or simply telas, the affair was negligible. One man had died but in dying he'd added one more page to the thick bulk of negative results already on file. The Mrs. Cloud and her children had perished was merely unfortunate. The vortex itself was not yet a real threat to telas. It was a new one and that's it would be a long time before it become other than a local man. Nor to any except a tiny fraction of earth's inhabitants was the question of loose atomic vortices of matter of concern. It was unthinkable that telas, the point of origin in the very center of galactic civilization, could cease to exist. Long before such fortices could eat away much of her mass or poison much of her atmosphere. Earth's scientists would have solved the problem. But to Neil Cloud, the accident was ultimate catastrophe. His personal universe had crashed in ruins. What was left was not worth picking up. He enjoyed been married for more than 15 years and the bonds between them had grown stronger, deeper true with every passing day and the kids, couldn't have happened. They couldn't do this to him, but it had, it could, gone, gone, gone. In Neil Cloud, Singler's desk and black abstraction with maggots of thought nine holes in his mind, the catastrophe was doubly galling because of its cruel irony. For he was second from the top in the vortex control laboratory, his life's work had been a search for a means of a method of extinguishing loose atomic vortices. His eyes focus vaguely upon the portrait. Wave you brown hair, clear on his gray eyes, lines of character, of strength and of humor, sweetly curved lips, ready to smile or to kiss. He arranged his attention away and scribbled briefly upon his sheet of paper. Then, getting up stiffly, he took the portrait and moved woodenly across the room to a furnace. After the flaming arc had done its work, he turned and handed the paper to a tall man with a lens glowing upon his wrist, who had been watching him with quiet understanding eyes. Significant enough to the initiate of the importance of the laboratory is the fact that it was headed by a lensman. As of now, Phil, if it's QX with you, the lensman took the document glance at it and slowly meticulously toward into 16 equal pieces. Ah, Storm, he denied gently, not a resignation, leave of absence perhaps, but not severance. Why not? His scarcely a question, clads voice with level and inflected, I wouldn't be worth the paper I'd waste. Now, no, but the future's another matter. I haven't said anything so far because I knew you and Joe, nothing could be said. Two hands gripped and held. For the future, though, four words that were spoken long ago have never been improved upon. This, too, shall pass. You think so? I know, so, Storm. I've been around a long time. Your two go to man to go down on a control. You've got a place in the world in a job to do. You'll be back. The thought struck the lensman and he went on and strangely altered tone. But you wouldn't, of course you wouldn't. You couldn't. I don't think so, no. Suicide tempting all that might be was not the answer. Goodbye, Phil. Not goodbye, Storm. Our Ravar. Maybe. Cloud left the laboratory and took an elevator down to the garage. Into his big blue Declancky special in a way. Through traffic so heavy that front rear and side bumpers almost touched. He drove with his wanted cool skill, even though he did not know consciously that the other cars were there. He slowed turns stop shoveled on the coal all correctly and all purely automatically. He did not know where it was going, nor care. His numbed brain was simply trying to run away from its own bitter imaginations, which, if he thought at all, he would have known helpless of accomplishment. But he did not think. He simply acted dumbly miserably. Into a one way skyway he rocked, along it over the suburbs and into the transcontinental superhighway. Edging in where Lane after Lane, he reached the unlimited way, unlimited that is except for being limited to cars of not less than 700 horsepower. In perfect mechanical condition, driven by registered test of drivers, had not less than 125 miles per hour. Flashed his number at the control station and shoved his foot right down to the floor. Everyone knows that ordinary Declancky sporter will do 140 unasslee-majored miles and one honestly timed hour. But very few drivers have ever found out how fast one of those brutal, big, souped-up specials can wheel. Most people simply haven't got what it takes to open one up. Storm Cloud found out that day. He held that 6,000-pound junker nut onto the road, wide open, for mile after mile, after mile. But it didn't help. Drivers he would, he could not outrun that which rode with him. Beside him and with him him and behind him for Joe was there. Joe and the kids, but mostly Joe, it was Joe's car as much as it was his, babe the big blue ox was her pet name for it. Because like Bunyan's fabulous beast, he was pretty nearly 6 feet between the eyes. Joe was in the seat beside him, every deer, every sweet, every luscious, lovely memory ever was there. And behind him just beyond eye-corner visibility were the three kids. In a whole lifetime of this loom to head, a vist of emptiness more vacuous by far than the emptiness reaches an intergalactic space. Damn nation, he couldn't stand much more of. However the roadway far ahead of brilliant octagon flared red, that meant stop in any language. Cloud eased up on the accelerator eased down on the brake pedal, took his place in line of almost stalled traffic. There was a barrier in a trimmer uniform policeman. Sorry sir, the officer said with a sweeping turning gesture. But you'll have to detour over to 20. There's a luscious atomic vortex beside the road up ahead. Oh, it's you Dr. Cloud. You can go ahead of course. A couple of miles yet before you'll need your armor. They didn't tell us they were sending for you. It's just a little new one and the dope we got was that they were going to shove it over to the badlands with pressers. They didn't send for me. Cloud tried to smile. I'm just driving around. No armor even so I might as well go back. He turned the special around. Alus Fortex, new. There might be three or four of them scattered over that many counties. Sisters of the one that had murdered his family. Spawn of that damn number 11 that bungling nitwit had tried to blow out. Into his mind they're leap to picture wire sharp of number 11 as he'd last seen it. And simultaneously an idea hit him like the blow of a fist. He thought really thought now intensely and clearly if he could do it could actually blow out the atomic flame of atomic vortex. Not exactly revenge, but it would work. It would have to work. He'd make it work and grimly quietly, but alive now in every fiber. He drove back to the city almost as fast as he had come away. The Philip strong was surprised to cloud suddenary appearance in the laboratory. He did not show it. Nortied to offer any comment as a zerswile assistant went to various lockers and cuddlers, assembling coils, tubes, armor, and other paraphernalia. Guess that's all I'll need chief cloud remarked finally. Here's a blank check. If some of this stuff shouldn't happen to be an usable condition when I get done with it, fill it out the suit will you? No. The linsman tore up the check to see the torn up the resignation. If you want the stuff for legitimate purposes, you're on troll business and it's the troll's risk. But if you're thinking of trying to snuff a vortex, the stuff stays here. That's out storm. But I'm going to really snuff them starting with number one and taking them in order. No suicide. Huh? Skip to a system incarnate. It can't be done, except by an almost impossible fortuitous accident, which is why you yourself have always been opposed to such attempts as the rest of this. The charge of explosive must match within very narrow limits. The activity of the vortex itself for the instance of detonation, and that activity varies so greatly and so unpredictably that all attempts at accurate extrapolation of failed. Even the conference of scientists couldn't develop a usable formula, any more that they can work out a tractor that could be used as a total line on one. Wait a minute, Cloud protested. They found that it could be forecast for a length of time proportional to the length of the cycling question, but an extension of the calculus of warp surfaces. Huh? I said a usable formula, the linsman snorted. What good is a 10 second forecast when it takes a gummy act twice that long to solve? Oh, he broke off staring. Oh, he repeated slowly. I forgot for a minute that you were born with a super-go-man can you're head, but there are other things. There were, now there are none. No? No. I couldn't take such chances before, and I'd have tied myself up in a nod so if I did. Now nothing can throw me. I can compute all the elements of a sigma curve and nothing flat. A 10 second prediction gives me 10 seconds of action. That's plenty. I see. Strong pondered, his fingers drumming softly upon his desk. Linsman did not ordinarily use their linses on their linseless friends, but this was no ordinary occasion. You aren't afraid of death anymore, but you won't invite it, and you might have a fun linsue on that. Come in. I'll not invite it, but that's as far as I'll go in promising. I won't make any superhuman effort to avoid it. I'll take all due precautions for the sake of the job, but if one gets me, what the hell? QX. Linsman withdrew from Cloud's mind. Not too good, but good enough. What's your plan? You won't have time for the usual method of attack. Like this. Cloud found a sheet of drafting paper and sketched rapidly. There's the crater with the vortex of the bottom there. From the sigma curve I estimate the most probable value of the activity I'll have to shoot at. Then I select three duoteck bombs from the 100 or so, I'll have made up in advance. One on the mark, one each 5% and over and under the mark. The bombs, of course, will be case in NeoCarbell Eye, thick enough for penetration. Then I take off from the shield and armored flying suit, say about there. If you take off at all, you and your suit will be inside of Flitter, the lens is been interrupted. Too many instruments for a suit to say nothing of bombs, and you'll need heavier screen than a suit can put out. We can adapt a flitter for bomb throwing easily enough. That'd be better, of course. QX, I set my Flitter into projectile trajectory towards the center of disturbance. 12 seconds away at about this point here. I take my instantaneous reading, solve the equations of that particular warp surface for some definite zero time. But suppose the cycle won't give you a 10 second solution. Then I'll swing around and try again until the long enough cycle does show up. QX, it will sometime. Sure, then having everything set for zero time and assuming that the activity is somewhere near my assumed value, assume it isn't, it probably won't be. Accelerator D-cellerate, solving new equations, differential equations at that, all the while. Certainly, don't interrupt so. I stick around until the sigma curve extrapolated to zero time. Matches one of my bombs. I build up the right velocity, cut that bomb loose, shoot myself off in a sharp curve, and Zweetie Pauy, she's out. It was an expressive sweeping gesture. You hope, strong was frankly dubious, and there you are right in the middle of the damn best explosion you ever saw. Oh no, I've gone free in the meantime, so nothing can touch me. I hope. But do you realize just how busy you're going to be during those 10 or 12 seconds? Yes, Clouds face Groo's somber, but I'll be in full control. I won't be afraid of anything that can happen. Of anything that can happen. For my standpoint, that's the hell of it. QX, the lens is been decided. You can go. Why are not the kinks as we go? We, I'll be in the lookout shack with the boys, at least on the first ones. When you want to start, how long will it take to fix up the flitter? Two days. Say we meet you there Saturday morning. I'll be there. And again, Neil Cloud and Bay of the big blue ox hit the road. And as you roll to on, the physicist mold over in his mind, the assignment to which he'd set himself. Like fire only were, satomic energy was a good servant, but a very bad master. Man had liberated it before he could really control it. In fact, control was not yet and probably never would be perfect. True, all except to my new fraction of 1% of the multitudes, a small team, self-limiting vortices were perfect servants. But at long intervals for some unknown reason, science knew so little fundamentally of nuclear reactions. And one of them flared noveliak into a huge wild self-sustaining monster. It ceased being a servant then and became a master. Such flare-ups occurred very infrequently. The trouble was that the loose vortices were so utterly, so damn-nidly permanent. They never went out no data were ever obtained. Every living thing in the vicinity of a flare-up died, every instrument and every other solid thing within a radius of hundreds of feet melted down into the wreaking boiling slag of its crater. Fortunately, the rate of growth was slow, as slow almost as it was persistent. But even so unless something could be done about loose vortices before too many years, the situation would become extremely serious. That was why the laboratory had been established in the first place. Nothing much had been accomplished so far. Character beams would not hold. Nothing material was even used. Pressors worked after a fashion. Vortices could be moved from one place to another. One or two through sheer luck had been blown out by heavy charges of Deco-Flettle, Omey. But Deco-Deck could take in many lives, and since it's scattered of vortexes often as it fed it, Deco-Deck could cause vastly more damage than it had cured. No end of fantastic schemes had been proposed, of course, of varying degrees of fantasy. Some of them sounded almost practical. Some of them had been tried, some were still being tried. Some such as the prenealy appearing one of installing a free drive and fleeing the whole neighborhood off into space were perhaps feasible from an engineering standpoint. They were potentially so capable of making things worse however that they could not be used except as last-ditch majors. In short, the control of loose atomic vortices was very much an unsolved problem.

As usual, my Lord, but bless me, how early your Lord ship is. I'll let you mean. I have not been in bed since yesterday at one. I am going home now to rest for an hour or two, and then to the drawing room. But, what are the two rustics about? I have not been plagued with them these three or four days. They are now out. I suppose that or I should not have called. But, privy, today talk a returning to their native woods again? Oh, no, sir. The young gentleman seems to have very different ideas. Miss, too, has great spirits. Oh, she seems now and then, at a loss what to do with herself. Do with herself? Why don't you persuade her to go back to Cornwall? You should tell them what a vile place London is. Full of snares and barcharies and witchcrafts. You don't preach to them, Johnson? Indeed, I do my Lord, and their constant answer is, oh Lord, Sparkle is our friend. Lord, Sparkle would take it a mess if we should go. It would look like distrusting his Lordship. Oh, was ever man so hampered, two fools to mistake common forms and civilities for attachments. I fear my Lord towards the young lady something more than forms. Never upon my honor. I kissed her, so I did all the women in the parish. The septennial ceremony. The brother I used to drink vile port with, listened to his village stories, call his vulgarity wit, and his impudence spirit. Was not that fatigue and modification enough, but must I be bored with them here in town? But Miss, sir, talks of press again, vitations and letters and things, of course, they had influence and got me the borough. I, in return, said she was the most charming girl in the world that I adored her, and some few things that everybody says on such occasions and nobody thinks of. But it appears that Miss did think. Yes, faith and, on my writing a civil note that I should be happy to see them in town, etc. Which I meant to have suspended our acquaintance till the general election. They took me out of my word. And before I thought the letter had reached them, they were in my house, all joined congratulations. I didn't choose to be in combat with them, so placed them with you. The boy was at first amusing, but our circles have had him, and I must be rid of him. I must say I wish I was quit at the net present. For my constant larger, Mr. Belleville came to town last night, and he once distraught in room to himself. He's obliged to share it now with Mr. Pendragon and his sister. Hey, Belleville. Yeah, that's lucky. There is not a fellow in town better received by the women. For the girl in his way, get rid of her at once. If you mean dishonestly, my Lord, you have mistaken your person. I did not live so many years with your mother to be capable of such a thing. My Lord, if my lady were living. He was gold, a little purpose. And you may spare yourself the trouble. I tell you, I care nothing about the girl. I merely want to get rid of her, and you must assist me. Mrs. Johnson turns from him with disgust. Hey, day, the nicer to leave your lady ship's order is peaked. The mistress of a lodging house. Biendrol. Exit Mrs. Johnson. But who was this hobbling upstairs? Oh, old Kate of the censor, my honorable cousin. What the devil shall I do? No avoiding him, however. Enter Mr. Fitzgerald. I wish I had been out of the house that served it before you appeared. I know I had to not escape without some of you's. I never throw away reproof, when there are no hopes of amendment. Your lordship is safe. Am I to take that for wit? No. For then I fear you would not understand it. Possitively, you must give me more of a fococity of your conversation. I want you to teach me some of that happy ease which you possess in your rudeness, to be to me an acquisition. I am eternally getting into the most horrors, grapes, merely by politeness and good breeding. Here are two persons now in this house, for instance? Who do not know? The language of what you call politeness differs from that of truth and honor. You see, I know those to whom you are lured. But we only lose time. Good day my lord. Lose time? Oh, I have what value can time be to you. The greatest enemy you have, adding every day to your wrinkles and you'll you. I'll prove to you now that I have employed the last 12 hours to better purpose than you have. Nine of them, you slept away. The last three you have been running about town, snarling and making people uneasy with themselves. While I have been fitting peacefully at Wilkes where I have won, guess what? Half as much as you lost yesterday, a thousand or two guinea's perhaps. Gini's, poor, you are justing. Gini's are as scarce with us as in the coffers of the Congress. Like them, we stick with counters and play for solid earth. Well, bullion is a mercantile kind of wealth, passing through the hands of dry salters, vinegar merchants, and lord mayors. Our goddess holds a corner copier instead of a purse from which she pours cornfields, fruitful valleys, and rich herds. This morning she popped into my dicebox a snug villa, 500 acres, arable pastures, with the next presentation to the living of Gossleton. A church living in a dicebox. Well, well, I suppose it will be bestowed as worthy as it was gained. Good day, my lord. Good day. Turning from him. Good night, gradry. Good night. Going off. Enter a servant. Tell Billville I called to congratulate his escape from the stupid country. Going. My lord. Sparkle, returning. Sir. I am going this morning to visit Lady Burl Bluma. I give you this information that we may not risk another raconter. Civility designed. And for the same polite reason, I inform you that I shall be there in the evening. Exit Lord Sparkle. Your master in bed yet? What time was he in town yesterday? Lates, sir. We should have been earlier, but we met with Mr. Ayerbrain on the road, with his new foxhounds. Felling with the untit bagshot, broke cover, run the first birds to cross the east towards Datchett. She then took right and in foring him. Sunk the wind upon us as far as stains, where Reina took the road to Oxford and we'd the route to Townsir. Bowing. Very geographical, indeed, sir. Now, pray. Inform your master. Oh, here we come. Enter Belleville in Orope de Schwamp. Just risen from your pillows. Are you not ashamed of this? A fox hunter, and in bed at 11. My dear Maros Charming Cross, my friend. I am ever in character. In the country, I defy for Teagan Harchip. Up before the lazy slut Aurora has put on a pink colour gown to captivate the plowboys. A scamper over her genditch. Dead with hunger, a lighted cottage, drink milk from the hands of a brown wench eat from a wooden clatter. In town, I am a fine gentleman. Have my hair, exactly dressed. My clothes are Dernier Gou, Dine on made dishes, drink burgundy, and in a word I'm everywhere the tongue. So much the worse, so much the worse young men. To be the tongue, where vise and folly are the ruling date, is proved that you must be sometimes a fool. And others are, you satirists, like mulls, shot your eyes to the light, and grow up about for the dark side of the human character. There is a great deal of good sense and good meaning in the world. As for its folly, I think folly are mighty pleasant thing. At least to play the fool gracefully, requires more talents and would said, but doesn't sit in. Then half the people I know must have wonderful talents. For they have been playing the fool from 16 to 60. A propot. I found my precious kingsman, Lord Sparkle here. There is an instance of the happy effects of total indifference to the sage Maxime's you recommend. Happy effects do you call them? Well, most triumphant, who so much the fashion, who so much admired the general favorite of the ladies, and the common objective imitation with the men, is not law-sparkled a happy man who is to carry the rich and charming widow lady belplum of so many rivals, and will not you after quarreling with him half your life not leave him the finest date at the end of it? No, no, I tell you, no. No, his success with the widow is certain. He boasts his triumph everywhere, and as she is such a favorite of yours, everything else will follow. No, for if she marries Sparkle, she will be no longer of favorite. Yet she receives him with the degree of distinction that sometimes makes me fear it, for we frequently see women of accomplishments and beauty to which every heart yields homage. Throw themselves into the arms of the debauched, the silly and the vain. Enter a servant, Mr. Beachen, exit. Oh, I expected him to call on you this morning. You must obtain his confidence. It will assist me in my designs. When I found myself disappointed in my hopes of his lordship, I selected Bullshop from the younger branches of my family. But of this, he knows nothing, and thinks himself on the high obligations to the patronage of the peer, an error in which I wish him to continue, as it will give me an opportunity of proving them both. But here he comes, this way I can avoid him. Exit. Enter Bochon. Bocham, and in Regimentals, while I crit the George, what spirit has seized the now? When I saw the last, I worked averted to the grave profession of the law, or the church, and I expected to have seen the enveloped in wake, wrangling at the bar or seated in a fat benefits receiving tithe pigs and poultry. Those, Belville, were my school designs, but the fire of youth gave me orders of a different fort. The heroes of the Herobagus and the forum have yielded to those of Marathon, and I feel that will, my country is struggling amidst surrounding foes. I ought not to devote a life to learn it indolence, that might be gloriously hazarded in her defense. Belville, smiling. I shant give you credit now for that fine flourish. This sudden order for the pride, pomp, circumstance of glorious war, I dress where the sorrow-experienced brings from the whim of some fine lady who fancy do be a smarter fellow in a cock-aiden gorgot than in a stiff band and peri-wig. If your insinuation means that my heart has not been insensible of the charms of some fair lady. You are right, but my transformation is owing to no whim of hers. For oh, Charles, she never yet condescended to make me the object of her thoughts. What is, too? I, you are right to give up the law, but who pray may this exalted fair one be, who never condescended? I never suffer my lips to wanton with the charming sounds that form her name. I have a kind of miserly felicity, including on her dear idea that would be impaired, should it be known to exist in my heart? You can be the nith who is inspired so obsolete a passion in the days of shivari would have been the tonne? I will gratify you thus far. The lady has beauty, wit and spirit, but above all, a mind. Is it possible, Charles, to love a woman without a mind? As you have mine for you? That's the most important question. I dare not feed my passion, so presumptuous I hope. Yet I would not extinguish it if I could. For it is not a love that tempts me into corners, to wear out my days and complaints. It prompts me to use them for the most important purposes. The ardors it gives me. Shall we felt in the land of our enemies? They shall know how well I love. This is the gallantry of 1,101. The kind of passion that would have animated our father's in the field of crescent and pothy-a, while no beauty of our age might be one in this style. Now, suppose yourself for the opera? Looking through his hand. Oh, you're good. That's a fine girl. 20,000 you say. I think I'll have her. Yes, I think so, do I must have her. I'll call on her tomorrow until her so. Have you spirit encouraged enough for that? My kid is? No, truly. Thank you for your time. I have no thoughts of hazarding a reception, the pride of birth, and a few hundreds for my education, with the sole patrimony, the impudence of a father left me. My relation, Lord Sparkle, is procured for me a commission. Generously to offer that, and an app sack to a lady of 5,000 a year would be properly answered by a contemptuous, dismission. But suppose she should take a fancy to an app sack? That would reduce me to the necessity of depriving myself of a happiness I would die to obtain. For never can I submit to be courtered on a wife's fortune, will it die have a sword to carve, substance for myself? That may be in the great style, but to scarcely in the polite. Will you take chocolate in my dressing room? No, I'm going to take orders at my kernels, where shall we meet in the evening? We're fed to this impossible to tell.

Gifts the catalogue to the maid. He must be a great comfort to her to see her jewels worn by her friends. Who was here last night? Sitting down and taking some cards from the table. I came home so late, I forgot to inquire. Mrs. Vesamey, lady racket, Miss Belvour, Lord Sparkle. Stouting up. Lord Sparkle here. Oh heavens and earth. What possessed me to go to lady prices? I wish she and her concert of three fiddles and a flutip and plain to her kids on the Welsh mountains. Why did you persuade me to go out last night? DMM, you seem so low-spinited that I thought. I missed him everywhere. At four places he was just gone as I came in. But what does it signify? To us lady Bell Blumer he was seeking. I dare swear. His attachment to the relict is everywhere the subject. Hang those widows. I really believe there's something capitalist to call in their names. No less than 14 young fellows of fortune have been drawn into the matrimonial news by them since last February. To as well they were threatened with imprisonment or we should not have had an unmarried infant above 17 between cherry cross and portman square. Well, I'm sure I wish lady Bell Blumer married. She's all with putting you out of temper. Have I not caused? Till she broke upon the town I was at the top of fashion. You know I was. My dress, my equipped, my furniture and myself were the criterions of taste. But a new French chamber made enable her lady ship at one stroke to turn the tide against me. I don't know I'd good these mademoiselle. But Tiffany, she has to be at court today. Out of mourning for the first time. I am resolved to be there. No, I won't go neither. Now I think on it. If she should really outshine me, her triumph will be increased by my being witnessed to it. I won't go to Saint James, but I'll go to her route this evening. Hand, if it is possible, prevent Lord Sparkles being particular to her. Perhaps that will put her in an ill humor and then the advantage will be on my side. Exit Clarinder Mercy on us to be a chamber made to a myth on the brink of 30 requires us good politics that's being prime minister.

Whatever may be the thought of these stories by older people, they have served with some others to induce a certain little boy to go to sleep. And for nearly three years, my one listener has heard them repeated many times, and his interest has never flagged, as the farmstories slowly grew in number, they entirely displace the other stories, and that farm has become as real in the mind of my audience as it was, in fact, when Little John was driving the cows, or planting the corn 75 years ago. The detail which may seem excessive to an older critic was in every case until I had learned to put it in at the start, the result of a searching cross examination. If the bars were not put up again, the cows might get out, and if the oxen did not pass on their return, all the familiar objects, how did they get back to the barn? It is the young critics that I hope to please those whose years count no more than six. If they like these farmstories, half as well as my own young critic likes them, I shall be satisfied.

When the sightseeing bus from Boston carries tourists from the West and South through the crooked and historic streets of Salem, Massachusetts. The lecturer waves his megaphone toward a long, turtle-backed rise of land with a stereotyped announcement. On your left-lead, you can zoom in as the famous Gallows Hill where witches were hanged in the colonial days. Just that. A 19 word sentence. A craning of curious necks, a raising of pro-funked orally interested eyes, and the cumbersome omnibus rumbles and bumps away on its homework trip. Leaving behind the monument of the most dreadful chapter in American history. A spot accursed to this day by the blood of innocent victims of fanaticism. A landmark bearing testimony to the terrible conflagration kindled by the effort of a bigoted, ignorant, self-righteous man to reassert his sway over the community, and retain the pitiful salary of a person in a small and un-tooth-riving colonial church. Let us push back the hands of the clock two and a half centuries. Salem village, small, but even now prosperous, clings to the rocky promatory, jutting your upward into the Atlantic Ocean. A few substantial houses of clapboard, fewer mentions of brick, brought as ballast and ships from England, and a forescwear white-dored church. On an heavenly cloak against the shrewish October wind, stride determinately through the narrow unpaid street talking earnestly. They are Joseph Parker, Joseph Hutchinson, Joseph Putnam, and Daniel Andrews, all freeholders in Salem village. A pointed at a recent town meeting, two considered ways and means for adjusting the controversy raging between the Reverend Samuel Paris, pastor of Salem Village Church, and his congregation two years before the Reverend Mr. Paris was called to the pulpit of Salem Village Church, in an effort to heal the dissension, cleaving the congregation, and settling in his position, the Reverend gentlemen drove a hard bargain with his people, extracting and pay the last brass-farthing the congregation could raise. Since his installation, he had intrigued continually for greater power in the community, failing to secure a deed to the parsnage property in his own name, he had set one faction of the congregation against the other, taking sides first with one side, then the other to the little band of worshippers is torn to pieces with factional strife. From the window of his study in the man's, Mr. Paris sees the foreselect men striding down the street, and his shallow face reflects the misgivings as heart feels. These men, substantial citizens all, are not to be brow beaten or bullied by any clergyman, no matter how thunderous his words are violent his temper. They will surely suggest the emptying of his pulpit as the only means of settling the controversy. Something must be done, a means must be found to unite the people in one common cause, and divert their dislike from their pastor. Love? No. The Reverend Mr. Paris's religion knows and love. He is a fundamentalist of the fundamentalists, and like his modern brethren of the same school finds his favorite passages of Scripture among those which tell of the dreadful vengeance of the Almighty. Fear? hatred? Perhaps? Those emotions sway men and women more vigorously than anything else. But how? How? The Reverend gentlemen takes up his great, cedar bound Bible, and opens it at random. Why, if not comfort, is to be found in its pages. He reads intently by the waning after noon sunshined, his long crooked nailed forfinger tracing the words of the eyes of our line after line. The twenty-seventh verse of the twentieth chapter of the book of Leviticus. And a man, also, or a woman, that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death, their blood shall be upon them. Their Paris closes the holy book and paces his study floor. His head bent, his lean, naughty fingers, locked behind his back. He meditates the text he had just read. Their blood shall be upon them. Among other household effects, the Reverend Mr. Paris owned two servants, John Indian partially civilized American Aberrigen, and Tituba, a half-breed woman from the West Indies part Indian Part Negro. Like most West Indian slaves, this woman laid claim to a knowledge of vooduism or obey a, pretending to tell fortunes by palmustrian, fortale the future by divination and communion with the spirits of the dead. Such things were roundly denounced and heavily penalized by the laws of the colony, which makes what followed doubly hard to explain. During the winter of 1691 and 92, a circle of young girls and women began meeting at the Reverend Mr. Paris's home for the purpose of consulting Tituba, and learning the secrets of palmustrian fortune telling. Those engaged in the forbidden pastime were Elizabeth Paris, aged 9, Abigail Williams, 17, and Putnam, 12, Mary Walcott, 17, Elizabeth Hubbard, 17, Susanna Sheldon, 18, Elizabeth Booth, 18, Sarah Churchill, 20, and several others in their late teens or early 20s. Mr. Paris could not have been unaware of these gatherings or of their purpose for two of the young women, Elizabeth Paris and Abigail Williams were members of his immediate family, and all the sehonses were held in his kitchen. Nevertheless, it does not appear that he forbade Tituba to teach the black arts to members of his family in flock, or denounced the unlawful assemblies to the authorities. On the contrary, he seems to have exhibited a mildness and tolerance entirely at variance with his usual habit and the custom of the times and community. Winter ran its course and springtime came, and with it a remarkable sequel to the meetings at Mr. Paris's house. The girls and women who had studied with Tituba began behaving in a most unaccountable manner. Some of them would creep under chairs, tables, or benches, others uttered strange and unintelligible words and cries. Still, others indulged in spasms and fainting fits, choosing the most public places to display their seizures. Simple home remedies failing to relieve the children's strange illness, the village physician I, Dr. Griggs, was called in, and after making an exhaustive examination of the patients, gave it as his opinion that they were bewitched. This was quite an accordance with medical ethics of the times, which permitted physicians to make the devil the excuse for their own inability to diagnose a case or effect a cure. The devil was no laughing stock in the 17th century. He was a very real and personal fiend, devoutly believed in by all who called themselves Christians and was ever on the watch for some unwavery soul. All the world was a sector on which the forces of good and evil contended unremittingly, and just as God chose his ministers, so the devil chose his to further his work among men. Holy scripture declared there were such things as witches, and it was man's bound in duty as a good follower of the church, to kill off this wicked brood wherever found. So it was in Salem Village in 1692, and the doctor's announcement of which craft set the superstitious people a fire. The afflicted children, differing not at all from children today, proceeded to make them most of their position in the public eye, and acted more outlandishly than before. Abigail Williams, Mr. Paris' own niece, rose in church one Sunday morning, and shouted to her uncle. Now stand up a name thy text! All eyes were turned on her and horrified amazement, but Mr. Paris, who had never before been known to let us slight to his ministerial dignity go unreduced, looked mildly at her, and announced his sermon would be based on the 18th verse of the 22nd chapter of the book of Exodus. thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. Since in those days were not gaged by the minute hand of the preachers' watch, but by the sins of an hourglass on the pulpit rail, and it was not till the glass had been twice reversed that Mr. Paris concluded his impassioned herring. He traced the abominable crime of witchcraft from biblical days to the founding of the Massachusetts Bay colony, ever reverting to his text and urging the congregation to perform their religious duty and put all witches to death. At the conclusion of his discourse, the little church was filled with an hysterical mob, ready to turn upon any suspected person and execute him on the spot. And the excitement was raised to fever pitch when one of the bewitched girls suddenly rose to her feet and cried, look where she sets upon the beam! Who? Who? Asked the congregation excitedly for they, of course, saw no one seated on the ceiling beams. Another girl, also eager to be noticed, rose with a wild shriek and exclaimed, there was a yellow bird sitting on a minister's hat! Where? Where? The bewildered people cried, for the yellow bird was naturally as invisible to them as the witch on the crossbeams. When meeting was over, the children's parents pressed them to name the wicked persons who had bewitched them. But here the girls became vague, contending themselves, was rolling their eyes, uttering terrified cries and pointing distractedly at terrible sights visible only to themselves. The afflicted children were hurried to the parsnige, where their parents besought Mr. Paris to pray for them. Just missing the elders, the minister locked himself in his study with the bewitched persons. At the end of an hour, he opened the door and announced the children had accused Sarah Good and Sarah Osburn, as the witches who had cast the spell upon them. Sarah Good was a poor, friendless old woman, subsisting largely on the charity of her neighbors. Sarah Osburn was, near in 80 years of age, and had been confined to bed by a lingering illness for several weeks. Both of these hapless creatures were dragged to the church, or a tribunal of clergyman, hastily summoned by Mr. Paris, bullied and hectic them for hours on end. No third degree imposed by modern police ever approached the methods employed by these godly men and attempting to extort confessions from two distracted and friendless old women. But the prisoners stood firm in maintaining their innocence. Then it was that Mr. Paris took counsel with the bewitched girls again, exhorting them to name some other which responsible for their agony. Soon he returned with these scandalous intelligence that Tituba, his own slave, had been denounced by the afflicted children. Tituba was hailed before the meeting, but her terror was so great that no intelligent answers could be extracted from her. She was parrolled in the custody of her master, who promised his reverend colleagues he would reason with her, and impress her with the error of her ways. Years later when she had been sold to another master, Tituba, then an old woman told of the terrible beatings administered by her reverend owner. She means merciless and unceasing until she willingly agreed to confess herself a witch and implicate Gudi Osborne and Gudi Good in her confession. Before a court composed of John, Hathorn, and Jonathan, and Corwin, the two leading magistrates of the neighborhood, assisted by Mr. Paris and several other, imminent, devines, Tituba gave her testimony. The devil, she said, had appeared to her and asked her to serve him. She agreed to do his bidding, and was told to attend to which his meeting in a nearby wood. Together with Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, she had mounted a wagon pole and had been whisked through the air with the speed of the wind. And the heart of a deep, dark grove, the location of which she was unable to give, the devil awaited them in the form of a huge black man, with one eye in the center of his forehead. She and the other two women had signed their names in his book with a pen dipped in their own blood, kissed him on an unusual part of his anatomy, and acknowledged themselves his servants forevermore. All this time, the afflicted children had been keeping up in an instant noise, screaming, groaning and writhing on the floor. When Gudi Osborne's poor old hands twitched with nervousness, the children declared they suffered agonies for she was pinching them. Sarah Good brought her toothless gums together in sea-nile terror, the shameless little wretched shrieked out that they were being bitten. Poor bed-ridden Sarah Osborne showed conclusively that she could not have attended any such meeting as that described by Tuba, for she had been confined to her home with illness at the time she was supposed to be attending the assassination. That the court decided was all the more proof of her witchcraft. Only a witch could be in two places at once, and since Tuba had testified Sarah Osborne was present at the meeting with the devil, and Sarah Osborne had shown she was home and bed at that very time, while for Suith she was in both spots at the same moment, and therefore more undoubtedly a witch than ever. Tuba, Sarah Osborne and Sarah Good were sent to Ipswich Jail as convicted witches, their to lie awaiting the hangman's convenience. Sphosure in the way to the heavy iron fetters riveted on her wrists and ankles proved too much for Mrs. Osborne. She died in Jail. Tuba, because she had confessed and especially because she had made the other two women's conviction possible, was granted a pardon and sent a Boston to be sold as a slave where it was supposed she would fall into the hands of an owner who would take her and her power for working evil far away from Salem village. Perhaps the fact that her removal would prevent her battling from connecting the Reverend Mr. Paris with the inception of the witchcraft prosecutions might have had some weight. Sarah Good lived to mount the gallows, as she stood with the rope about her throat. A clergyman said, thou ought to wick at which. The second of C. Barry Quinn's true tales of witchcraft will describe the accusations of evil, made by our pureton ancestors against Giles and Martha Cory, whose memory has been preserved in long fellow's poem drama.

Home Education Series Volume 6 towards a philosophy of education by Charlotte Mason. Forward, Preface, Synopsis and Introduction. Forward, our forefathers trusted of you all to the wrong and too coercion for the evoking in children of a love of learning. For the last 50 years we have rested our hopes on the enthusiasm of the teachers. But that enthusiasm were not fictitious, often acts prejudishly by diverting the child's love of knowledge and new ideas into admiration for his teacher and when that fails, as it frequently does, nothing is left except extraneous and baneful appeals to self-interest. This Mason saw and in this volume has explained that the natural and only quite wholesome way of teaching is to let the child's desire for knowledge operate in the schoolboy and guide the teacher. This means that without foregoing discipline or cutting ourselves off from tradition, we must continue experiments already being started in our elementary schools. These are based on the chasening fact that children learn best before we adults begin to teach them at all and hence that however unconjennial the task may be, we must conform our teaching methods to those of nature. The attempt has often been made before but in this volume there is a rare combination of intuitive insight and practical sagacity. The author refused to believe that the collapse of the desire for knowledge between seven and 17 years of age is inevitable. So must we. Edward Littleton, D.D. Preface It would seem a far cry from undine to a liberal education where there is a point of contact between the two. A soul awoke within a water sprite at the touch of love. So I have to tell of the awakening of a general soul at the touch of knowledge. Eight years ago the soul of a class of children in a mining village school awoke simultaneously at this magic touch and has remained awake. We know that religion can awaken souls that love makes a new man that the call of a vocation may do it and in the age of the Renaissance men's souls the general soul awoke to knowledge. But this appeal rarely reaches the modern soul and notwithstanding the pleasantness, attending lessons and marks in all our schools. I believe the harder for knowledge in the children of this mining village is a phenomenon that indicates new possibilities. Already many thousands of the children of the Empire had experienced this intellectual conversion but they were the children of educated persons. We find that the children of a mining population were equally responsive seemed to open a new hope for the world. It may be that the souls of all children are waiting for the call of knowledge to awaken them to delightful living. This is how the late Mrs. Francis Steintier, who was the happy instigator of the movement in council schools, wrote, quote, I think of the meaning of this in the lives of the children. Disciplined lives and no lawless strikes, justice and end to class warfare developed intellect and no market for trashy and corrupt literature. We shall, or rather, they will live in a redeemed world."" This was written in a moment of enthusiasm on hearing that a certain county council had accepted a scheme of work for this pioneer school. In enthusiasm sees in advance the fields white to the harvest, but indeed the event is likely to justify high expectations. Though less than nine years have passed since that pioneer school made the bold attempt, already many thousands of children working under numerous county councils are finding that, quote, studies serve for delight, hint-quot. No doubt children are well-tought and happy in their lessons as things are, and this was especially true of the school in question, yet both teachers and children find an immeasurable difference between the casual interest roused by marks, pleasing oral lessons and other school devices, and the sort of steady evidity for knowledge that comes with the awakened soul. The children have converted the school inspectors, quote, and the English, and quote, said one of these in astonishment, as he listened to their long graphic dramatic narrations of what they had heard. During the last 30 years, we, including many fellow workers, have had thousands of children in our schoolrooms, home, and other, working on the lines of Dean Colett's prayer for St. Paul's school, quote, pray for the children to prosper in good life and good literature, and quote, probably all children so taught, grow up with such principles and pursuits as make for happy and useful citizenship. I should like to add that we have no acts to grind. The public goodies are aim and the methods proposed are applicable in any school. My object in offering this volume to the public is to urge upon all who are concerned with education a few salient principles, which are generally either unknown or disregarded, a few methods, which, like that, batting in Jordan, are simple to commend themselves to the general. Yet, these principles and methods make education entirely a factual. I should like to add that no statement that I have advanced in the following volume rests upon opinion only. Every point has been proved in thousands of instances, and the method may be seen at work in many schools, large and small, elementary and secondary. I have to beg the patience of the reader who is asked to approach the one terminus by various avenues, and I cannot do so better than in the words of old Fula, called Good Reader. I suspect I may have written something's twice, if not in the same words yet in sense, which I desire you to pass by favorably for as much as you may well think. It was difficult and a dull thing for me in so great a number of independent sentences to find out the repetitions. Besides the pains, such a search would cost me more time than I can afford, and my glass of life running now low, I must not suffer one's sand to fall in waste, nor suffer one minute in picking off straws. But to conclude this, since in matters of advice, precept must be upon precept, line upon line, I apologise in the words of St. Paul, to write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe."" I am unwilling to close what is probably the last preface I shall be called upon to write, without a grateful recognition of the cooperation of those friends who are working with me in what seems to us a great cause. The parents' national education union has fulfilled its mission as declared in its first prospectus, nobly and generously. Quote, the union exists for the benefit of parents, and teachers of all classes. In Quote, and for the last eight years it has undertaken a labour and expense of an energetic propaganda on behalf of elementary schools of which about 150 are now working on the programs of the parents' union school. During the last year a pleasing and hopeful development has taken place under the auspices of the Honorable Mrs. Franklin. It was suggested to the head of a London County Council school to form an association of the parents of the children in that school, offering them certain advantages and requiring a small payment to cover expenses. At the first meeting one of the fathers present got up and said that he was greatly disappointed. He had expected to see some 300 parents and they were only about 60 present. The promoters of the meeting were, however, well pleased to see the 60 most of whom became members of the parents' association and the work goes on with spirit. We are deeply indebted to many fellow workers, but not even that very courteous gentleman who once wrote a letter to the Romans, could make suitable acknowledgment to all of those to whom we owe the success of a movement, the rationale of which I have attempted to make clear in the following pages. While at him Mason, House of Education, Embleside, 1922, a short synopsis of the educational philosophy advanced in this volume. No sooner doff for truth come into the soul's sight, but the soul knows her to be her first and old acquaintance. The consequence of truth is great, therefore the judgment of it must not be negligent. One, children are born persons. Two, they are not born either good or bad, but with possibilities for good and for evil. Three, the principles of authority on the one hand and of obedience on the other are natural, necessary and fundamental. But, for these principles are limited by the respect due to the personality of children, which must not be encroached upon, whether by the direct use of fear or love, suggestion or influence or by undue play upon any one natural desire. Five, therefore we are limited to three educational instruments, the atmosphere of environment, the discipline of habit and the presentation of living ideas. The P in E U motto is, quote, education is an atmosphere, a discipline and a life in quote. Six, when we say that education is an atmosphere, we do not mean that a child should be isolated in what may be called a child environment, especially adapted and prepared, but that we should take into account the educational value of his natural home atmosphere, both as regards persons and things, and should let him live freely among his proper conditions. It stultifies a child to bring down his world to the child's level. Seven, by education is a discipline, we mean the discipline of habits formed definitely and thoughtfully with a habits of mind or body. The other just tell us of the adaptation of brain structures to habitual lines of thought are to our habits. Eight, in saying that education is a life, the need of intellectual and moral as well as of physical sustence is implied. The mind feeds on ideas and therefore children should have a generous curriculum. Nine, we hold that the child's mind is no mere sack to hold ideas but is rather, if the figure may be allowed a spiritual organism with an appetite for all knowledge. This is its proper diet, with which it is prepared to deal and which it can digest and assimilate as the body does foodstuffs. Ten, such a doctrine, as for example the Hobartian, that the mind is a receptacle, lays the stress of education, the preparation of knowledge in enticing morsels, do the ordered upon the teacher. Children taught on this principle are in danger of receiving much teaching with little knowledge and the teacher's axiom is, quote, what a child learns, matters less than how he learns it into quote. 11, but we, believing that the normal child has powers of mind which fit him to deal with all knowledge proper to him, give him a full and generous curriculum, taking care only that all knowledge offered him is vital, that is, that facts are not presented without their informing ideas. One of this conception comes our principle that, twelve, education is the science of relations. That is, that a child has natural relations with the vast number of things and thoughts. So we train him upon physical exercises, nature law, and de-crafts, science and art, and upon many living books. For we know that our business is not to teach him all about anything but to help him to make valid as many as may be of, quote, those first-born affinities that fit our new existence to existing things, and quote. 13, in devising a syllabus for a normal child of whatever social class three points must be considered. A, he requires much knowledge, for the mind needs sufficient food as much as does the body. B, the knowledge should be various, for sameness in mental diet does not create appetite, I curiosity. C, knowledge should be communicated in well-chosen language because his attention responds naturally to what is conveyed in literary form. 14, as knowledge is not assimilated until it is reproduced, children should till back after a single reading or hearing or should write on some part of what they have read. 15, a single reading is insisted on because children have naturally great power of attention, but this force is dissipated by the rereading of passages, and also by questioning, summarizing and the like. Having upon these and some other points in the behavior of mind, we find that the educated ability of children is enormously greater than has here that we being supposed. And he is but little dependent on such circumstances as heredity and environment. Nor is the accuracy of this statement limited to clever children or to the children of the educated classes, thousands of children in elementary schools respond freely to this method, which is based on the behavior of mind. 16, there are two guides to the moral and intellectual self-management to offer to children, which we make all the way of the will and the way of the reason. 17, the way of the will, children should be taught, A, to distinguish between I want and I will, B, that the way to will effectively is to turn our thoughts from that which we desire, but do not will. C, that the best way to turn our thoughts is to think of or do some quite different thing entertaining or interesting. D, that after a little rest in this way, the will returns to its work with a new vigor. This adjunct of will is familiar to us as diversion whose office it is to ease us for a time from will effort that we may will again with added power. The use of suggestion as an A to the will is to be deprecated as tending to stultify and stereotype character. It would seem that spontaneity is a condition of development and that human nature needs the discipline of failure as well as of success. 18, the way of reason, we teach children to not to lean to confidently on their own understanding, because the function of reason is to give logical demonstration A of mathematical truth, B of an initial idea accepted by the will. In the former case, reason is practically an infallible guide, but in the latter it is not always a safe one, for whether that idea be right or wrong, reason will confirm it by irrefutable proofs. 19, therefore children should be taught as they become mature enough to understand such teaching that the chief responsibility which rests on them as persons is the acceptance or rejection of ideas. To help them in this choice we give them principles of conduct at a wide range of knowledge fitted to them. These principles should save children from some of the loose thinking and heedless actions which cause most of us to live at a lower level than we need. 20, we allow no separation to grow up between the intellectual and spiritual life of children, but teach them that the divine spirit has constant access to their spirits and is there continual helper in all the interests, duties and joys of life. Introduction These are anxious days for all who are engaged in education. We rejoice in the fortitude, vala and devotion shown by our men in the war and recognise that these things are due to the schools as well as to the fact that England still breeds called very valiant creatures, it is good to know that, quote, the whole army was illustrious in, quote. The heroism of our officers derives and added impulse from that tincture of letters that every public school boy gets and those playing fields where boys acquire habits of obedience and command. What about the abysmal ignorance shown in the wrong thinking of many of the men who stayed at home? Are we to blame? I suppose most of us feel that we are, for these men are educated as we choose to understand education that is, they can read and write, think perversely and follow an argument, though they are unable to detect a fallacy. If we ask in Pplexity why do so many men and women seem incapable of generous impulse of reasoned patriotism, of seeing beyond the circle of their own interests is not the answer that men are enabled for such things by education. These are the marks of educated persons and when millions of men who should be the backbone of the country seem to be dead to public claims, we have to ask why then are not these persons educated and what have we given them in lieu of education. Our errors in education so far as we have heard turn upon the conception we form of mind and the theory which has filtered through to most teachers implies the out of date notion of the development of faculties, a notion which itself rests on the axiom that thought is no more than a function of the brain. Here we find the sole justification of the scanty curricula provided in most of our schools for the torturous processes of our teaching, for the mischief of a assertion that, quote, it does not matter what a child learns but only how he learns it. If we teach much and children learn little, we come for ourselves with the idea that we are developing this or the other faculty. A great future lies before the nation which shall perceive that knowledge is the sole concern of education proper as distinguished from training and that knowledge is the necessary daily food of the mind. Teachers are looking out for the support of a sound theory and such a theory must recognize with conviction the part mind plays in education and the conditions under which this prime agent acts. We want a philosophy of education which, admitting that thought alone appeals to mind, that thought begets thought, shall relegate to their proper subsidiary places, all those sensory and muscular activities which are supposed to afford intellectual as well as physical training. The latter is so important in and for itself that it needs not to be bolstered up by the notion that it includes the whole or the practically important part of education. The same remark holds good of vocational training. Our journalists ask with Skorn, is there no education but what is got out of books at school, is not the lad who works in the fields getting education and the public lacks the courage to say definitely no, he is not. Because there is no clear notion current as to what education means and how it is to be distinguished from vocational training. But the people themselves begin to understand and to clamour for an education which shall qualify their children for life rather than for earning a living. As a matter of fact it is the man who has read and thought on many subjects who is with the necessary training the most capable, whether in handling tools, drawing plans or keeping books. The more of a person we succeed in making a child, the better will he both fulfill his own life and serve society. Much thoughtful care has been spent in ascertaining the causes of the German breakdown in character and conduct. The war scourge was symptomatic and the symptoms have been due the traced to their cause in the thoughts that people have been taught to think during three or four generations. We have heard much about Nietzsche, Träicchka, Bänhardi and the rest, but Professor Muaheid did a good service in carrying the investigation further back. Darwin's theories of natural selection, the survival of the fittest, the struggle for existence, struck root in Germany, in fitting soil and the ideas of the Superman, the super-state, the right of might, to repudiate treaties, to eliminate feeble powers, to recognise no law but expediency, all this appears to come as naturally out of Darwinism as a chick comes out of an egg. No doubt the same Diktor have struck us in the commentaries of Frederick the Great, quote they shall take who have the power and they shall keep who can, in quote, is ages older than Darwin, but possibly this is what our English philosopher did for Germany. There is a tendency in human nature to elect the obligations of natural law in preference to those of spiritual law, to take its code of ethics from science and following this tendency the Germans found in their reading of Darwin, sanction for manifestations of brutality. Here are a few examples of how German philosophers amplify their Darwinian text, quote, in matter, dwell all natural and spiritual potencies, matter is the foundation of all being. To equal spirit, thought, the faculty of knowledge consists of natural, though peculiarly combined forces, in quote. Darwin himself protests against the struggle for existence being the most potent agency, where the higher part of man's nature is concerned, and he no more thought of giving a materialistic tendency to modern education than lock thought of teaching principles, which should bring about the French revolution. But these men's thoughts are more potent than they know, and these two English men may be credited with influencing powerfully to worldwide movements. In Germany, prepared by a quarter of a century of materialistic thought, the teaching of Darwin was accepted as offering emancipation from various moral restraints. Ansthecker is distinguished follower finds in the law of natural selection, sanction for Germany's lawless action, and also that pregnant doctrine of the Superman. This principle of selection is nothing less than democratic, on the contrary, it is aristocratic, and the strictest sense of the word, in quote. We know how Buchenne, again simplified and popularised these new theories, quote, all the faculties which we include under the name of psychological activities, are only functions of the brain substance. Thought stands in the same relation to the brain as the goal to the liver, in quote. That useful misuse Germany has made of the teaching of Darwin would not save for the war be of immediate concern to us, where it not that she might have given us back our own, in the form of that, quote, mythology of sacculties psychology, and quote, which is always possess in the way of educational thought. English psychology proper has advanced, if not to firm ground at any rate to the point of repudiating the faculty basis. Quote, however much a sail the concept of a mind is, we are told to be found in all psychological writers, and quote, but there are but mind and matter, and when we are told again that psychology rests on feeling where are we? Is there a middle region? 2. We fail the recognised that as the body requires wholesome food and cannot nourish itself upon any substance, so the mind too requires meat after its kind. If the war toward nothing else it taught us that men are spirits that the spirit, mind of a man is more than his flesh, that his spirit is the man, that for the thoughts of his heart he gives the breath of his body. As a consequence of this recognition of our spiritual nature, the lesson for us, at the moment, is that the great thoughts, great events, great considerations, which form the background of our national thought shall be the content of the education we pass on. The educational thought we hear most about is, as I have said, based on sundry Darwinian axioms, out of which we get the notion that nothing matters but physical fitness and vocational training. However important these are, they are not the chief thing. A century ago when Prussia was shipwrecked in the Napoleonic Wars, it was discovered that not Napoleon but ignorance was the formidable national enemy. A few philosophers took the matter in hand, and history, poetry, philosophy, proved the salvation of a ruined nation. Of course, such studies make for the development of personality, public spirit, initiative, the qualities of which the state was in need, and which most advanced individual happiness and success. On the other hand, the period when Germany made her school curriculum utilitarian marks the beginning of her moral downfall. History repeats itself. There are interesting rumours of float of how the students at Bon, for example, went in solemn procession to make a bonfire of French novels, certain prints, articles of luxury and their like. Things like these had brought about the ruin of Germany, and it was the part of the youth to save her now as before. Are they to have another Toulken Bund? We want an education which shall nourish the mind while not neglecting either physical or vocational training, in short, we want a working philosophy of education. I think that we of the P&EU have arrived at such a body of theory, tested and corrected by some 30 years of successful practice with thousands of children. This theory has already been set forth in volumes published at intervals during the last 35 years, so I shall indicate here on the a few salient points which seemed to me to differ from general theory and practice. A. The children, not the teachers, are the responsible persons. They do the work by self-effort. They teach us give sympathy and occasionally illucidate, some up or in large, but the actual work is done by the scholars. See, these read in a term 1 or 2 or 3,000 pages, according to their age, school and form, in a large number of set books. The quantity set for each lesson allows of only a single reading, but the reading is tested by narration or by writing on a test passage. When the terminal examination is at hand, so much ground has been covered that revision is out of the question. Without the children have read, they know and write on any part of it with ease and fluency in vigorous English, they usually spell well. Much is said from time to time to show that mere book learning is rather contemptible and that things are in the saddle and ride man-kind. May I point out that whatever discredited is due to the use of books does not apply to this method, which, so far as I can discover, has not here that who been employed. As an attempt being made before on a wide scale to secure that scholars should know their books, many pages in many books at a single reading, in such a way that months later they can write freely and accurately on any part of the term's reading. D. There is no selection of studies or of passages or of episodes on the ground of interest. The best available book is chosen and is read through perhaps in the course of two or three years. E. The children study many books on many subjects, but exhibit no confusion of thought and howlers are almost unknown. F. They find that in bacon's phrase studies serve for delight. This delight being not in the lessons or the personality of the teacher, but purely in their lovely books, glorious books. G. The books used are, whenever possible, literary in style. H. Marx, prizes, places, rewards, punishments, praise, blame or other inducements are not necessary to secure attention, which is voluntary, immediate and surprisingly perfect. I. The success of the scholars in what may be called disciplinary subjects, such as mathematics and grammar, depends largely on the power of the teacher, though the pupils have a bit of attention, is of use in these two. J. No stray lessons are given on interesting subjects, the knowledge the children get is consecutive. The unusual interest children show in their work, their power of concentration, their wide, and as far as it goes accurate knowledge of historical literary and some scientific subjects has challenged attention and the general conclusion is that these are the children of educated and cultivated parents. It was vain to urge that the home school room does not usually produce remarkable educational results, but the way is opening to prove that the power these children show is common to all children. At last there is hope that the offspring of working class parents may be led into the wide pastures of a liberal education. We not justified in concluding that singular effects must have commensurate causes, and that we have chanced to light on unknown tracks in the region of educational thought. At any rate that golden rule of which communeous was in search has discovered itself, the rule called whereby teachers shall teach less and scholars shall learn more, and quote, let me now outline a few of the educational principles which account for unusual results. Three. Principles hitherto unrecognized or disregarded. I have enumerated some of the points in which our work is exceptional in the hope of convincing the reader that unusual work carried on successfully in hundreds of school rooms, home or other, is based on principles hitherto unrecognized. The recognition of these principles should put our national education on an intelligent basis and should make for general stability, joy in living and personal initiative. May I add one or two more arguments in support of my plea? The appeal is not to the clever child only but to the average and even to the backward child. This scheme is carried out in less time than ordinary schoolwork on the same subject. There are no revisions, no evening lessons, no cramming or getting up of subjects. Therefore there is much time, whether for vocational work or interests or hobbies. All intellectual work is done in the hours of morning school, and the afternoon are given to field nature studies, drawing, handicrafts, etc. Notwithstanding these limitations the children produce a surprising amount of good intellectual work. No homework is required. It is not that we of the PMEU are persons of peculiar genius. It is that like Paley's man who found the watch, we have chanced on a good thing. No gain that I experience must remain unshared. We feel that the country and indeed the world should have the benefit of educational discoveries which act powerfully as a moral lever for we are experiencing a new the joy of the Renaissance, but without its pagan lawlessness. Let me trace as far as I can recall them, the steps by which I arrived at some of the conclusions upon which we are acting. While still a young woman I saw a great deal of a family of Anglo-Indian children who had come home to their grandfather's house and were being brought up by an aunt who was my intimate friend. The children were astonishing to me. They were persons of generous impulses and sound judgment of great intellectual aptitude, of imagination and moral insight. These last two points were I recollect illustrated one day by a little maiden of five who came home from her walk, silent and sad. Some letting alone and some wise openings brought out at last between sobs, quote, a poor man, no home, nothing to eat, no bed to lie upon, in court, and then the child was relieved by tears. Such incidents are common enough in families, but they were new to me. I was reading a good deal of philosophy and education at the time, for I thought with the enthusiasm of a young teacher that education should regenerate the world. I had an elementary school and a pioneer church high school at this same time, so that I was enabled to study children in large groups, but at school children are not so self-revealing as at home. I began under the guidance of these Anglo-Indian children to take the measure of a person and soon to suspect that children are more than we, their elders, accept that their ignorance is illimitable. One limitation I did discover in the minds of these little people, my friend insisted that they could not understand English grammar. I maintained that they could and wrote a little grammar, still waiting to be prepared for publication, for the two of seven and eight, but she was right. I was allowed to give the lessons myself with what lucidity and freshness I could command. In vain the nominative case baffled them. Their minds rejected the abstract conception just as children reject the notion of writing and essay on happiness, but I was beginning to make discoveries. The second being that the mind of a child takes or rejects according to its needs. From this point it was not difficult to go on to the perception that, whether in taking or rejecting the mind was functioning for its own nourishment. That the mind, in fact, requires sustenance as does the body. In order that it increase and be strong, but because the mind is not to be measured or weighed, but is spiritual so its sustenance must be spiritual too. Must in fact be ideas, in the platonic sense of images. I soon perceived that children were well equipped to deal with ideas and that explanations, questionings, amplifications, unnecessary and weri-sum. Children have a natural appetite for knowledge which is informed with thought. They bring imagination, judgment and the various so-called faculties to bear upon a new idea pretty much as the gastric juices act upon a food ration. This was illuminating but rather startling. The whole intellectual apparatus of the teacher is power of vivid presentation, apt illustration, able summing up, subtle questioning, all these were hindrances and intervened between children and the right newtrumant duly served. This, on the other hand, they received with the sort of avidity and simplicity with which a healthy child eats his dinner. The Scottish school of philosophers came to my aid here with what may be called their doctrine of the desires which I perceived stimulate the action of mind and so cater for spiritual, not necessarily religious sustenance as the appetites do for that of the body and for the continuance of the race. This was helpful. I insert that one of these, the desire of knowledge, curiosity, was the chief instrument of education. That this desire might be paralyzed or made powerless like an unused limb by encouraging other desires to intervene between a child and the knowledge proper for him, the desire for place, emulation, for prizes, Everest, for power, ambition, for praise, vanity, might each be a stumbling block to him. It seemed to me that we teachers had unconsciously elaborated a system which should secure the discipline of the schools and the eagerness of the scholars by means of marks, prizes and the like, and yet eliminate that knowledge hunger itself the quite sufficient incentive to education. Then arose the question, cannot people get on with little knowledge? Is it really necessary after all? My child friends supply the answer, their insatiable curiosity showed me that the wide world and its history was barely enough to satisfy a child who had not been made apathetic by spiritual malnutrition. What then is knowledge? Was the next question that occurred, a question which the intellectual labour of ages has not settled, but perhaps this is enough to go on with? That only becomes knowledge to a person, which he has assimilated, which his mind has acted upon. Children's aptitude for knowledge and their eagerness for it made for the conclusion that the feel that a child's knowledge may not be artificially restricted, that he has a right to and necessity for as much and as very knowledge as he is able to receive. And that the limitations in his curriculum should depend only upon the age at which he must leave school. In a word, a common curriculum up to the age of, say, 14 or 15 appears to be due to all children. We have left behind the feudal notion that intellect is a class prerogative, that intelligence is a matter of inheritance and environment. Inheritons no doubt means much, but everyone has a very mixed inheritance. Environment makes for satisfaction or uneasiness, but education is of the spirit and is not to be taken in by the eye or affected by the hand. Mind appeals to mind and thought gets thought, and that is how we become educated. For this reason we owe it to every child to put him in communication with great minds that he may get at great thoughts, with the minds that is of those who have left us great works. And the only vital method of education appears to be that children should read worthy books, many worthy books. It will be said on one hand that many schools have their own libraries, or the scholars have the free use of a public library and that children do read. And on the other that the literary language of first-rate books offers an impossible barrier to working men's children. In the first place, we all know that desultory reading is delightful and incidentally profitable, but is not education whose concern is knowledge. That is, the mind of the desultory reader only rarely makes the act of appropriation, which is necessary before the matter we read becomes a personal knowledge. We must read in order to know, or we do not know by reading. As for the question of literary form, many circumstances and considerations which it would take too long to describe brought me to perceive that delight in literary form is native to us all until we are educated out of it. It is difficult to explain how I came to a solution of a puzzling problem, how to secure attention. Much observation of children, various incidents from one's general reading, the recollection of my own childhood, and the consideration of my present habits of mind brought me to the recognition of certain laws of the mind by working in accordance with which the steady attention of children of any age and any class in society is ensured, we can, we can, we can, attention, not affected by distracting circumstances. It is not a matter of personal magnetism, for hundreds of teachers of very varying quality, working in home school rooms and in elementary and secondary schools on this method, secure it without effort. Neither does it rest upon the doctrine of interest. No doubt the scholars are interested, sometimes delighted, but they are interested in a great variety of matters and their attention does not flag in the dull paths. It is not easy to sum up in a few short sentences those principles upon which the mind naturally acts and which I have tried to bring to bear upon a school curriculum. The fundamental idea is that children are persons and are therefore moved by the same springs of conduct as they elders. Among these is the desire of knowledge, knowledge honger being natural to everyone. History, geography, the thoughts of other people, roughly the humanities, are proper for us all and are the objects of the natural desire of knowledge. So two are science for we all live in the world and art for we all require beauty and are eager to know how to discriminate. Social science ethics for we are aware of the need to learn about the conduct of life and religion for like those men we heard of at the front we all want God. In the nature of things then the unspoken demand of children is for a wide and very varied curriculum. It is necessary that they should have some knowledge of the wide range of interests proper to them as human beings and for no reasons of convenience or time limitations may we curtail their proper curriculum. Perceiving the range of knowledge to which children as persons are entitled the questions are how shall they be induced to take that knowledge and what can the children of the people learn in the short time they are at school. We have discovered a working answer to these two conundrums. I say discovered and not invented for there is only one way of learning and the intelligent persons who can talk well on many subjects and the expert in one learn in the same way. That is they read to know. What I have found out is that this method is available for every child whether in the dilatory and desultory home school room or in the large classes of elementary schools. Children are no more come into the world without provision for dealing with knowledge than without provision for dealing with food. They bring with them not only that intellectual appetite, the desire of knowledge but also an enormous and unlimited power of attention to which the power of retention memory seems to be attached. As one digestive process succeeds another until the final assimilation. Yes it will be said they are capable of much curiosity and consequent attention but they can only occasionally be begiled into attending to their lessons. Is not that the fold of the lessons and must not be regulated as carefully with regard to the behaviour of mind as the children's meals are with regard to physical considerations. Let us consider this behaviour in a few aspects. The mind concerns itself only with thoughts, imaginations, reasoned arguments. It declines to assimilate the facts unless in combination with its proper pabulum. It being active is weird in the passive attitude of a listener. It is as much bored in the case of a child by the discursive twaddle of the talking teacher as in that of a grown-up by a conversational twaddle. It has a natural preference for literary form, given a moral less literary presentation the curiosity of the mind is enormous and embraces a vast variety of subjects. I predicate these things of the mind because they seem true of all persons minds. Having observed these and some other points in the behaviour of mind, it remained to apply the conclusions to which I had come to a test curriculum for schools and families. ORL teaching was to a great extent ruled out. A large number of books on many subjects were set for reading in morning school hours, so much work was set that there was only time for a single reading, all reading was tested by an erasure of the whole or a given passage, whether ORL or in writing. Children working on these lines no months after that which they have read and are remarkable for their power of concentration, attention. They have little trouble with spelling or composition and become well-informed intelligent persons. But it will be said reading or hearing various books read, chapter by chapter and then narrating or writing what has been read or some part of it, all this is mere memory work. The value of this criticism may be readily tested, will the critic read before turning off his light, a leading article from a newspaper, say, or a chapter from Boswell or Jane Austen, or one of Lams essays. Then will he put himself to sleep by narrating silently what he has read? He will not be satisfied with the result, but he will find that in the act of narrating every power of his mind comes into play, that points and bearings which he had not observed and brought out, that the whole is visualized and brought into relief in an extraordinary way. In fact, that scene or argument has become a part of his personal experience. He knows he has assimilated what he has read. This is not memory work. In order to memorize we repeat over and over a passage or a series of points or names with the aid of such clues as we can invent. We do memorize a string of facts or words and the new possession serves its purpose for a time, but it is not assimilated. It's purpose being served, we know it no more. This is memory work by means of which examinations are passed with credit. I will not try to explain or understand this power to memorize. It has its subsidiary use in education, no doubt, but it must not be put in the place of the prime agent which is attention. Long ago I was in the habit of hearing this axiom quoted by a philosophical old friend, quote, The mind can know nothing, say what it can produce in the form of an answer to a question, put to the mind by itself, and quote, I have failed to trace the saying to its source, but a conviction of its importance has been growing upon me during the last 40 years. It tacitly prohibits questioning from without. This does not of course affect the secretic use of questioning for purposes of moral conviction, and it is necessary to intellectual certainty to the act of knowing. For example, to secure a conversation or an incident we go over it in our minds, that is the mind puts itself through the process of self-questioning, which I have indicated. This is what happens in the narrating of a passage raid, each new consecutive incident or statement arrives because the mind asks itself what next. For this reason, it is important that only one reading should be allowed, if it's to memorize weaken the power of attention, the proper activity of the mind. If it is desirable to ask questions in order to emphasize certain points, these should be asked after and not before, or during the act of narration. They too predicate, instead of a country of faculties, a single subjective activity attention. And again, there is one common factor in all psychical activity that is attention. My personal addition is that attention is unfailing, prompt, and steady when matters presented suitable to a child's intellectual requirements, if the presentation be made with the conciseness, directness, and simplicity, proper to literature. Another point should be born in mind. The intellect requires a moral impulse and we all stir our minds into action the better, if there is an implied must in the background, for children in class the must acts through the certainty that they will be required to narrate or write from what they have read with no opportunity of looking up or other devices of the idle. Children find the act of narrating so pleasurable in itself that urgency on the part of the teacher is seldom necessary. Here is a complete chain of the educational philosophy I have in David to work out, which has at least the merit that it is successful in practice. Some few hints I have, as I have said, adopted and applied, but I hope I have succeeded in methodising the whole and making education what it should be, a system of applied philosophy. I have, however, carefully abstained from the use of philosophical terms. This is briefly how it works. A child is a person with the spiritual requirements and capabilities of a person. Knowledge nourishes the mind as food nourishes the body. A child requires knowledge as much as he requires food. He is furnished with the desire for knowledge, I.e. curiosity, with the power to apprehend knowledge that is attention, with powers of mind to deal with knowledge without aid from without, such as imagination, reflection, judgment. With innate interest in all knowledge that he needs as a human being, with power to retain and communicate such knowledge and to assimilate all that is necessary to him. Here requires that in most cases knowledge be communicated to him in literary form and reproduces such knowledge, touched by his own personality. Thus his reproduction becomes original. The natural provision for the appropriation and assimilation of knowledge is adequate and no stimulus is required, but some moral control is necessary to secure the active attention. A child receives this in the certainty that he will be required to recount what he has read. Children have a right to the best we possess, therefore their lesson books should be as far as possible, our best books. They weary of talk and questions bore them so that they should be allowed to use their books for themselves. They will ask for such help as they wish for. They require a great variety of knowledge about religion, the humanities, science, art. Therefore they should have a wide curriculum with a definite amount of reading set for each short period of study. The teacher of forwards direction, sympathy and studies, a verifying word here and there, help in the making of experiments, etc, as well as the usual teaching in languages, experimental science and mathematics. Pursued under these conditions, studies serve for delight and the consciousness of daily progress is exhilarating to both teacher and children. The reader will say with truth, I knew all this before and have always acted more or less on these principles, and I can only point to the unusual results we obtain through adhering not more or less, but strictly to the principles and practices I have indicated. I suppose the difficulties are of the sort that Lister had to contend with every surgeon knew that his instruments and apprentices should be kept clean, but the saving of millions of lives as resulted from the adoption of the great surgeons and to septic treatment. That is the substitution of exact principles, scrupulously applied for the rather casual, more or less methods of earlier days. Whether the way I have sketched out is the right and the only way remains to be tested still more widely than in the thousands of cases in which it has been successful, but assuredly, education is slack and uncertain for the lack of sound principles exactly applied. The moment has come for a decision. We have placed our faith in civilisation, have been proud of our progress and of the pangs that the war has brought us. Perhaps none is keener than that caused by the utter breakdown of the civilisation which we have held to be synonymous with education. We know better now and are thrown back on our healthy human instincts and the divine sanctions. The educational part of a person is his mind. The training of the senses and muscles is strictly speaking training and not education. The mind, like the body, requires quantity, variety and regularity in the sustenance offered to it. Like the body, the mind has its appetite, the desire for knowledge. Again, like the body, the mind is able to receive and assimilate by its powers of attention and reflection. Like the body, again, the mind rejects in sippid, dry and unsevery food that is to say its pambilum should be presented in a literary form. The mind is restricted to pambilum of one kind. It is nourished upon ideas and absorbs facts only as these are connected with the living ideas upon which they hang. Children educated upon some such lines as these, respond in a surprising way, developing capacity, character, countenance, initiative, and a sense of responsibility. They are, in fact, even as children, good and thoughtful citizens. I have in this volume attempted to show the principles and methods upon which education of this sort is being successfully carried out and have added chapters which illustrate the history of a movement, the aim of which is in the phrase of Communus, all knowledge for all men. As well as these, I have been permitted to use the criticisms of various teachers and directors of education and others upon the practical working of the scheme. It is a matter of rejoicing that the way is open to give to all classes a basis of common thought and common knowledge, including a common store of literary and historical illusions, a possession, which has a curious power of cementing bodies of men. And in the next place, it is an enormous gain that we are within sight of giving to the working classes, notwithstanding their limited opportunities that stability of mind and magnitude of character, which are the proper outcome and the unfailing test of a liberal education. I shall confine myself in this volume to the amplification and illustration of some of the points I have in David to make in this introductory statement.

Section 1, Meltyd Melody by James J. McAvoy. Wherever the famous band leader and composer, misuse Susan, appears with his orchestra. He is preceded like royalty by an advanced career. Consequently, when the world-known orchestra was built for one night at a certain town in the Great Lake region, the manager arrived early in the morning, arranging that misuse Susan with his half-hundred men should follow in the afternoon. He had barely completed his preliminary business and gone up to his room when a black faced buttons brought in a card and mumbled confidently that the gentleman was in a mighty bakery. Before misuse Susan manager had read the name on the card, a man stepped briskly into the room, closed the door with a quick backward movement and spoke abruptly. You are misuse Susan's manager? I am. You play tonight at the grand opera house? Yes. The concert will close about 11. Near that. I wish to engage the full band for the rest of the night. What will be the amount of the bill? Misuse Susan's manager stared. Back pardon? He queried. And when the singular quest was repeated, began to shake his head dubiously. He was not a hasty man. However, and he took second thoughts and a second look at the other before speaking the point blank refusal that was on his lips. The man was tall, firmly built, and perhaps 55 or 60. His flowing hair was white, and his face smoothed shavin. Safe for a thin, blanch, moustache, though brimming with nervous energy he scooped slightly, and his grey penetrating eyes peered through gold, bowed spectacles in a searching questioning way. He was well dressed, and he had the appearance of a man of affairs. The manager's tone altered. Your desire, you will permit me to say, is not exactly of the usual sword. Our services and the price, well, that would depend on what you wish us to do, where you would wish us to play and to what audience. I want your musicians under Mr. Susan's leading to play for about half, or possibly three quarters of an hour. There will be no audience. The place is not in the city, but some distance outside. I will be at the opera house at the close of the concert. I will have characters in waiting at the stage entrance. It will be at two hours ride each way. Then, as though noting the dubious look again, stealing over the face of the manager, he went unheardly. The service desired, maybe unusual, I dare say, you are right, but I am ready to pay you well. At the time chosen best serves, the essential condition of secrecy. For there must be a promise on the part of yourself and of Mr. Susan and his men to reveal nothing whatever of the affair until I make it public. Certain other requirements will be made known to you all before we start. I guarantee your entire satisfaction with my arrangements, and I guarantee the safe return of the entire party by six o'clock tomorrow. Now, what is your price? Again, the manager hesitated, repeated his remark about the unusualness of the proposition, and ended by postponing his decision until the arrival of Mr. Susan at five that afternoon. To this arrangement, the other consented, though with the cessness of one accustomed to dominate, remarking as he went out that the band he did engage would be likely to add an interesting leaf to its laurels, as well as money to its pockets. As the door closed, Mr. Susan's manager tilted his chair, pushed back his coat, slit his thumbs into the armholes of his vest, and whistled along Christian Luw whistle, with in-drawn breath. He had just turned to the consideration of how big a bill the man would stand when the door opened and Mr. Susan entered, to be greeted by a heard recital of the proposition just submitted to his manager. But who was it? What's the man's name? The band Master asked as the other finished his story. Confounded, if I know, wait, the boy did bring a card, I believe, but the man got in ahead of time, and then so astonished me that I forgot it. Here it is now. This was the card. Professor John Henry Pierce, American Museum. Oh, Professor Pierce, exclaimed Mr. Susan. Very well, tell him we will go and don't charge him over 500 either. There, there, to the other's stammering junior, his old right, he may do queer things he has often, but whatever he proposes, it's old right. Who is he anyway? Oh, a big scientist, one of the great guns of the museum, did some curious things in chemistry, then took up ethnology and went rummaging about in caves, crying into the secrets of prehistoric man, expects to find the skeleton of the missing link for all I know. After ransacking and digging into the deposits in the great caves, mammoth, lurei, and the others and crawling through all the little ones, he went down and swallowed in the caves of Yuketan, and the last I heard it was feared he was lost off in the Jolounen Carvins in Australia. Interesting man remarked the manager. Yes, and when he first took to spectacles his friends in Washington used to tell him jokingly that it all came of living underground, and that presently he would have nothing left but rummidently eyes, like the blind fish in mammoth cave, all the same the professor can see a mightily sight more than most men even now. As to his latest scheme, with a finality of action that silence the objection on the manager's lips, you may be sure that we shall come out of it okay, and the result will probably some surprising addition to the world's stock of knowledge. Now, he added, I'm going over to the opera house when professor Pierce returns tell him that the whole concern shall be at his service at the close of the concert, and be sure you agree to anything that he proposes. So it was that when the professor walked in on the stroke of five, he found the way he made smooth before him. The manager followed Miss Jozo's instructions in every particular, save one. In writing the bill for advanced payment, he added 50% to the amount Miss Jozo's in had named as outside limit, and chuckled to himself when without blinking the professor drew his check for the amount and hurried away. The hangers on at the opera house were puzzled. There was an air of mystery about the place that peaked their curiosity. The last number on the program in the final enquire had been rendered. The lost burst of applause had died away in the Russell and Bustle and Chatter of the departing audience. The musicians had come out of the hall and crossed the passage into the main dressing room. An unusual time had lapsed, yet no one had reappeared. Outside the drivers of a few night liners were gathered in a group at the back stand on the square discussing the meaning of the row of great close six horse, omnibuses drawn up before the stage entrance. The drivers of the omnibuses sat on the boxes as mute as statues. The stream of humanity which had poured out of the pillar, cortico of the opera house, had flowed away into the night. The blaze of lights had been quenched. The square had sunk into its midnight repose of dimness and silence. As the musicians entered the main dressing room at the close of the concert, they each in succession noticed Mr. Zousen and his manager, standing by a table at one side, and then each in succession started at sight of a most unusual figure beside them. A man with flowing white hair wearing a dark robe that fell to his feet and rolled away from the neck into a hooded cape that lay over the shoulders and ended in a point half down the back. Miss Yuzouzhen almost immediately turned to his men. I have not often had occasion to test your cooperative spirit, hit or marked quietly, but I do so now with confidence even when I announce that I have made an engagement for the National Symphony Orchestra to go some distance out of the city and give another performance between now and morning. I need hardly say that I shall make due return for this extra service. And you will permit me, said that curiously wrote a stranger before the first surprise could pass into possible objection, to add to Miss Yuzouzhen's business statement a few particulars. First, I wish to assure you of your personal comfort and safety, before leaving here I shall serve you substantial refreshments, and you will be returned to your hotel in season for at least a cat nap before breakfast. I am aware that the snide expedition and performance following the concert just ended, make a large demand upon you. And in appreciation of that fact, with Miss Yuzouzhen's sanction, I now hand his manager an additional check for 200 dollars to be divided among you on your return. The stranger here handed a check to the manager. And now, gentlemen, he resumed. I have two favors to ask, first that you will humor the, well, the way of an old man, an eccentric old man if you like, and each wear over his dress suit a rule, such as I have on myself. Then, while some of the older men began to look as canes, and most of the younger, to show an eager interest and to pass about the hint of a must grade, he took his step forward, definitely lifted the peaked hood, drew it out his head, and dropped down before his face a curtain-like visor with a breathing hole and discs of colored glass set before the eyes. I must ask, went on the disguised figure before them, that no man left his visor after leaving this room until our return to the hotel. Also, as this is a secret expedition, I must ask the individual promise of each man to reveal nothing of the affair until I make it public. Miss Yuzouzhen and his manager go under the same conditions. The old man touched a bell, folding doors at one side slide back, disclosing a stable spread with substantials and waiters in attendance. As the man came back into the main dressing room, talking and laughing in high-good humor, they found a long table piled with the mass-grading robes, and as each received his garment, he gave his promise of secrecy. The manager then let the monk-like procession through the lobby down the stairs and out to the waiting omnivisues. Miss Yuzouzhen and his manager were to ride with Professor Pierce in his private carriage, which stood at the rear end of the line. As the professor held open the door, Miss Yuzouzhen stepped in and then drew back with a surprise exclamation. He had found himself face-to-face with a feminine figure, cloaked and veiled sitting silent and moveless on the back seat. Professor Pierce laughed lightly. A friend, he said simply, Yuzouzhen had an introduction later if you need one. Then began the long ride, first the rapid jolting over a couple city streets after that, with the scattering of lights, the yielding rave of country roads. There was no moon, and though the colored glasses they felt only a vague colour-scopic obscurity, flashed through at times by the light of lamps burned late in village homes or outlaying farms. By lovers, loath to part, or may have, by lonely souls holding vigil by the dead. While and then came hells out which the horses toiled only to gallop down the decline, and then satel into a swift even pace across the level. Gradually the levels shortened in and the hells rose up higher and steeper. The road ruffened until they seemed to be riding over untracked ground. In the momentary pauses, the panting with the horses was half lost in the soothing of the wind through the trees, then the panting pauses alternated with jerky poles, upper precipitous steeps, the wheels grinding over ledges, and sinking into silences of fallen leaves until finally the forward movement ceased altogether. Word was now passed from one vehicle to another, and the men, their vision obscured, and their movements hindered by the clinging robes descended cautiously to the ground and stood waiting orders. Somewhere ahead a fearful light flared up as of a torch carried in the windy darkness. The professor and his party passed along to the head of the line, but nobody noted the unmasculined form of one of the four. Then the right hand of each man was placed upon a guideline, and he was told to move forward slowly following the man ahead of him. Presently the suppressed acceleration of wonder and amazement yielded to a vague apprehension. The will of a whisper light had only emphasized the blacker darkness into which they had entered. There were no longer stars overhead, there was an uncanny shill in the air, a faint hollow reverberation repeated the footfalls of the procession. They were aware of pat-like wings. Gradually it stole into the consciousness of one and another that they were descending into a cavern, and the thought went in whisper from man to man. After a time the way no longer slanted downward, but stretch out in a smooth level, and progress was more rapid. Suddenly the verb-bration seemed to come from a receding distance as if they had reached an open space. Then sounded the command to halt and lift guisers. Missyu Zouzen and his half-hundred musicians as their eyes were unveiled to their surroundings. Theld as might enchanted men in an enchanted palace, they were grouped in a great rounded alcove, in the side of the vaulted passage along which they had come, which stretch on beyond to the limit of vision. The opposite across the vaulted passage opened another great alcove carved and doomed like an abs of a cathedral. As a dozen torches were rapidly set in a semicircle around the space, the musician gazed in wonder at the dazzling spectacle before them. Thunder gleaming select eyes as of albaster descended on all sides, often joining with up-spraining stalactmites to far on unbroken columns. Back at the center where might have stood the high altar was a marble-wide projecting ledge down over which spread a shimmering flow as of water, though it disappointed the expectation in never falling from the edge. Beneath the singular sloping shelf and extending out to the center of the alcove floor, a wide limbed pool of water mirrored, the glittering torch lumened scene, from the domed roof and out across the passage and over their heads, dependent a mirrored minor stalactites. Translucing as icicles each holding at its stiff at trembling drop. The professors stood for a moment motionless before the torch led grotto as before a shrine, and indeed such it was to him that night, then he turned to Mr. Zousin. Play, Hisa. And either as a result of the leader's sense of the fitness of things or the professors' stipulation, the band broke into the stately music of old-hundred, while each memory supply the stately words. B. Tao, O god, exalted high, as thy glory fills the sky. That henhouseer, overture, followed, and then one of Mr. Zousin's own famous marshes fit for a nation's advancing feet. The marchum music died and splendid echoing stunned the endless passage and a movement in the professor's party drew O eyes. As a butterfly emerges from its closeless, a silken white woman emerged from her rapings and stepped out into the rosy light of the torches. Had an inf reason from the pool, no greater would have been the surprise. The half-hundred men leaned forward, looked and then listened, while a marvelous voice sang, Martinez-Moravless, swan song of the queen. As the tragic tones of the hard break had their lost echoed repetition, La Diva-Morayana shouted the musicians and fairly went wild in applause. The professor had a short misuse-osens manager that the band would have no audience. But for those musicians, La Diva-Morayana, where it was indeed the world famous Prima-Dona, was alone an audience, and in their long-life garb, in that subterranean torches like whole, they rendered in a trianfent wave for her one-hormers' multidaneous sea, with all its amazing range of atletting tumble and a pacific con. Its rappelling runs up sandy beaches, its groundswell kidnises, flashing thundering to Mendris-Fanali. As La Diva-Morayana rose like a white whirlwind kissing her hand to the men in graceful acknowledgement, they are befell a startling phenomenon. Jard, perhaps by the tremendous musical vibration, the mirried drops that trembled at the select-type tips overhead fell in a shower, a shower not a rain, but through some transformation in their transit, a shower of rattling glittering hail, and the men picked the hellstones up in wonder and watched the melds in their hands. They were half inclined to attribute this strange thing to the magic of the professor, for the manager had given them a hint as to his personality, but they had not long to meditate upon this wonder, for again La Diva-Morayana stood before them, she lifted her hand for silence, and now she was singing home-sweet-hole, as only she can sing it. And as always when she sings, men weft with the homeless pain. For such music silence was the only possible applause in the hush following a sharp crackling report turned every eye to the opposite alcove, as the alter-life projection plunk forward and fell with a gleaming splash into the pool below. Instantly, as the ripple rings such the edges of the basin, a delicate musical harmony provided all the air, sounding on and on in swelling tones, as if augmented by its own echoes until rumbling down the vaulted passage in melodic thunder. It receded far, far and died away, then suddenly reflected by the some opposing wall of rock, the great melody came rolling back in redoubled volume. The voice of many waters cried La Diva-Morayana in a tone of awe. Professor Pierce who has sprung forward and stood peering into the pool, now turned to earn misyozozen and his musicians. His white hair was shaken into a hollow about his head, his face glowed, and there was a ring of triumph in his voice. Gentlemen, he said, you have my thanks, your performance has been a great musical success, I believe it will also prove a great scientific achievement, you may now go all of you. Slowly the cowled procession as the torches died down to dimness, followed the guideline back to the omin buses, and if unwaking from his catnap before breakfast, one another pinched himself and still could not say if he waked or dreamed. It is little wonder. Professor Joan Henry Pierce appears in public an audible audience is present. At the last session of the International Science Association, the interest and expectancy were increased by his recent resurrection from the Jolene, carvings and by the rumor that he was to make a new and startling revelation. As the audience gathered groups of great conservatives, mingling with young men fired with the enthusiasm of discovery, and with end of century visions of the undiscovered, the eyes of all turned to the stage was undisclosed curiosity, attendance, were bringing in a tool gas stove with a large picture near talk. This was connected by flexible tubing with a gas picture, then a huge cabinet was wheeled in and its outer doors swung back, revealing though a thick, flat glass, a frosty white interior. Pretty little pleasantries began to flit about the room. One was the professor was about to make a visible exhibition of the hottest heat in Zachter position with the coldest cold. One of the feminine origin asserted that they would presently be invited to a sample and absolutely scientific omelet, a third declared that they were about to witness an exposition of prehistoric quickly, favorite dish in the age of tales. The professor's first words arrested this likeness of mind. I have one son again, he said, been honored with a commission as ambassador of nature, if I may so put it, to bring before this association facts new designs. I am again so commissioned. He paused, then resumed. One of the great English scientists, Faraday, was it not, when about to witness another demonstration as to know for what he should watch, giving you likewise a clue. I will say that you are not to look but to listen. Professor Pierre is now motioned to his attendance and while one lighted the gas stove, he himself unlocked the cabin and directed the other to remove a large porcelain pan on which stood edge-wise a white-ish slab and placed it upon the top of the stove. The porcelain pan stated the professor holds a slab of ice, white and translucent from air imprisoned in rapid freezing, slowly frozen water as you know yielding in a set transparent ice, but there is more than air imprisoned in this ice, as it melts a marvel will be manifest. Listen. Professor Pierre slowly raised his right hand as if in response to the movement, the music of all 100 took its stately way of silence into the hearing of the people. The full rich music of an orchestra rendering yet no orchestra was in the hall. There was indeed a faint quality of remoteness in the music as if it played behind a screen or curtain yet no one thought of a hidden band. The audience knew Professor Pierre's and that knowledge granted the genuineness of the marvel checking the movement to applaud at the end of the him, professors stood with uplifted hand, a quiet smile on his face while everyone listened in wonder to that end-houser overture and then to the most famous of those and marshes at that the applause started with cries of zozen, zozen wonderful. Professor stepped forward with both hands lifted warning to silence while martini is swung song floated through the air. Then it was that the audience praying to its feet and sheer la diva mariana, men cried Bravo and in the first law of who is called out to it again, professor. There can be no decor at this concert, remarked a professor with a light laugh, the music which was frozen into eyes has escaped in the melting and I have no power to recapture it. More music however is imprisoned in the unmelted section of the eyes and that you shall hear presently. When the tempestuous finale of one Homer's multidus sees, had dissolved into the air, professor Pierre's mentioning his attendance to return the remaining eyes to the cabin said, Before resuming the concert I will give you briefly the history of my discovery, the mystery of which I have as yet been partly penetrated. Sometime after my return from the hill caves of yukatan and before my departure for Australia in the course of my ethnologic researches, I opened what proved to be the grave mound of a medicine man or priest of now extended people. Among the relics they have labelled covered with hero glyphic writing, then in an narrative bristling with technicalities the professor related how the tablet translated during his absence by the experts in the museum proved the key to the location of a sacred cover, where in before a shrine or altar the priest performs sacred rides. At this altar so the tablet read in mid-summer flowing water was miraculously changed to white rock. This white rock presumably eyes took within itself the chance of the priest and on being grown to outlaying parts delivered the sacred music to other tribes. And in so doing itself vanished, to the speaker with his extensive knowledge of caves and cave dwellers it had proved an easy matter to discover this holy of hollies and to verify the statement concerning the properties of the white rock. Nor was it any wonder that a primitive people discovering the cave by accident the formation of eyes in mid-summer had seemed supernatural its vocal qualities worshipped and that the spot thought by them as sheltered had soon been converted into shrine whose vocal eyes was made to serve priestly purposes. For the experiments of the scientists had confirmed the record of pre-historic man through repeated tests he had discovered that in that immemorial carbon by some marvelous but so unexplained acoustic and chemical combination every vibration of sound was conveyed to the waterfall. The pros and into the constantly forming slap of eyes as sounds are recorded on the slender of the phonograph and they're imprisoned until released by the melting of the eyes. My final test, Hoes Rosals, you know, the professor said in finishing, was performed by taking to the cavern, misuse of zanz band and a famous prima donna. By another year I expect not only to melt melody but to congeal it in your presence and who knows but that at the banquet following the meeting your eyes may melt in your mouth to the melody of enchanting music. Even while his book The attendees had been making ready the last slap and now I made a hush such as might precede a penidiction. They're gushed from the melting eyes like water from the rock touched by Ernst Rod, the liquid notes of La Divina Marianna's voice in the music of Hoes Sweet Home.

Read by Jen Broda. Gentleman preferablauns by Anita Luz. Chapter 1. Gentleman preferablauns. March 16th. A gentleman friend and I were dining at the ritz last evening, and he said that if I took a pencil and a paper and put down all of my thoughts, it would make a book. This almost made me smile as what it would really make would be a whole row of encyclopedias. I mean, I seem to be thinking practically all of the time. I mean it is my favourite recreation, and sometimes I sit for hours and do not seem to do anything else but think. So this gentleman set a girl with brains ought to do something else with them besides think. And he said he ought to know brains when he sees them because he is in the Senate, and he spends quite a great deal of time in Washington, D.C. And when he comes into contact with brains, he always notices it. So it might have all blown over, but this morning he sent me a book. And so when my maid brought it to me, I said to her, well Lulu, here is another book, and we have not read half the ones we have got yet. But when I opened it and saw that it was all a blank, I remembered what my gentleman acquaintance said, and so then I realized that it was a diary. So here I am, writing a book instead of reading one. But now it is the 16th of March, and of course it is too late to begin with January, but it does not matter, has my gentleman friend, Mr. Isman, was in town practically all of January and February, and when he is in town, one day seems to be practically the same as the next day. I mean Mr. Isman is in the wholesale button profession in Chicago, and he is the gentleman who is known practically all over Chicago as Gus Isman, the button king, and he is the gentleman who is interested in educating me. So of course he is always coming down to New York to see how my brains have improved since the last time. But when Mr. Isman is in New York, we always seem to do the same thing, and if I wrote down one day in my diary, all I would have to do would be to put quotation marks for all the other days. I mean we always seem to have dinner at the colony and see a show, and go to the Troca D'Aro, and then Mr. Isman shows me to my apartment. So of course when a gentleman is interested in educating a girl, he likes to stay and talk about the topics of the day until quite late, so I am quite fatigued the next day, and I do not really get up until it is time to dress for dinner at the colony. It would be strange if I turn out to be an authorous. I mean at my home near Little Rock Arkansas, my family all wanted me to do something about my music, because all my friends said I had talent, and they all kept after me, and kept after me about practicing. But some way I never seemed to care so much about practicing. I mean I simply could not sit for hours and hours at a time practicing just for the sake of a career. So one day I got quite temperamental, and through the old mandolin clear across the room, and I have really never touched it since. But writing is different because you do not have to learn or practice, and it is more temperamental, because practice seems to take all the temperament out of me. So now I really almost have to smile, because I have just noticed that I have written clear across two pages on to March 18th, so this will do for today and tomorrow, and it just shows how temperamental I am when I get started. March 19th. Well, last evening Dorothy called up, and Dorothy said she has met a gentleman who gave himself an introduction to her in the lobby of the rits. So then they went to luncheon and tea and dinner, and then they went to a show, and then they went to the trocadero. So Dorothy said his name was Lord Cooksley, but what she really calls him is Kuku. So Dorothy said, why don't you and I and Kuku go to the folly's tonight and bring Gus along if he isn't down? So then Dorothy and I had quite a little quarrel, because every time Dorothy mentions the subject of Mr. Isman, she calls Mr. Isman by his first name, and she does not seem to realize that when a gentleman who is as important as Mr. Isman, spends quite a lot of money educating a girl, it really does not show reference to college entomined by his first name. I mean I never even think of calling Mr. Isman by his first name, but if I want to call him anything at all, I call him daddy, and I do not even call him daddy if a place seems to be public. So I told Dorothy that Mr. Isman would not be in town until day after tomorrow. So then Dorothy and Kuku came up and we went to the folly's. So this morning Kuku called up and he wanted me to luncheon at the Ritz. I mean these foreigners really have quite a nerve, just because Kuku is an Englishman and a Lord, he thinks a girl can waste hours on him just for a luncheon at the Ritz. When all he does is talk about some exposition he went on to a place called Typet, and after talking for hours, I found out that all they were was a lot of China men. So I will be quite glad to see Mr. Isman when he gets in, because he always has something quite interesting to talk about. As for instance, the last time he was here, he presented me with quite a beautiful emerald bracelet. So next week is my birthday and he always has some delightful surprise on holidays. I didn't tend to luncheon at the Ritz with Dorothy today, and of course Kuku had to spoil it as I told him that I could not luncheon with him today, because my brother was in town on business and had the mumps, so I really could not leave him alone. Because of course, if I went to the Ritz now, I would bump into Kuku. But I sometimes almost have to smile at my own imagination, because of course, I have not got any brother, and I have not even thought of the mumps for years. I mean it is no wonder that I can write. So the reason I thought I would take luncheon at the Ritz was because Mr. Chaplin is at the Ritz, and I always like to renew old acquaintances, because I met Mr. Chaplin once when we were both working on the same lot in Hollywood, and I am sure he would remember me. Gentlemen always seem to remember blondes. I mean the only career I would like to be besides an authorist is a cinema star. And I was doing quite well in the cinema when Mr. Eisenman made me give it all up. Because of course, when a gentleman takes a friendly interest in educating a girl as Mr. Eisenman does, you like to show that you appreciate it, and he is against a girl being in the cinema, because his mother is Orthodox. March 20th. Mr. Eisenman gets in tomorrow to be here in time for my birthday. So I thought it would really be delightful to have at least one good time before Mr. Eisenman got in. So last evening I had some literary gentleman in to spend the evening, because Mr. Eisenman always likes me to have literary people in and out of the apartment. I mean he is quite anxious for a girl to improve her mind, and his greatest interest in me is because I always seem to want to improve my mind, and not waste any time. And Mr. Eisenman likes me to have what the French people call, a solo, which means that people all get together in the evening and improve their minds. So I invited all of the Brainy gentlemen I could think of. So I thought a gentleman who is the professor of all the economics up at Columbia College, and the editor who is the famous editor of the New York transcript, and another gentleman who is the famous playwright who writes very, very famous plays that are all about life. I mean anybody would recognize his name, but it always seems to slip my memory, because all of we real friends of his only call him Sam. So Sam asked if he could bring a gentleman who writes novels from England, so I said yes, so he brought him, and then we all got together, and I called up Gloria and Dorothy, and the gentleman brought their own liquor. So of course the place was erect this morning, and Lulu and I worked like proverbial dogs to get it cleaned up, but heaven knows how long it will take to get the shandleer fixed. March 22nd. Well, my birthday has come and gone, but it was really quite depressing. I mean it seems to me a gentleman who has a friendly interest in educating a girl like Gus Eisenman, would want her to have the biggest square cut diamond in New York. I mean I must say I was quite disappointed when he came to the apartment with a little thing you could hardly see. So I told him I thought it was quite cute, but I had quite a headache, and I had better stay in a dark room all day, and I told him I would see him the next day perhaps, because even Lulu thought it was quite small, and she said if she was I, she really would do something definite, and she said she always believed in the old adage, leave them while you're good looking. But he came in at dinner time with really a very, very beautiful bracelet of square cut diamonds, so I was quite cheered up. So then we had dinner at the colony, and we went to a show and supper at the Trocadero, as usual whenever he is in town. But I will give him credit that he realized how small it was. I mean he kept talking about how bad business was, and the button profession was full of Bolsheviks, who made nothing but trouble. Because Mr. Eisenman feels that the country is really on the verge of the Bolsheviks, and I become quite worried. I mean if the Bolsheviks do get in, there is only one gentleman who could handle them, and that is Mr. D. W. Griffith. Because I will never forget when Mr. Griffith was directing intolerance. I mean it was my last cinema just before Mr. Eisenman made me give up my career, and I was playing one of the girls that fainted at the battle when all of the gentlemen fell off the tower. And when I saw how Mr. Griffith handled all of those mobs and intolerance, I realized that he could do anything, and I really think that the government of America ought to tell Mr. Griffith to get already if the Bolsheviks start to do it. Well, I forgot to mention that the English gentleman who writes novels seems to have taken quite an interest in me, as soon as he found out that I was literary. I mean he has called up every day, and I went to teach twice with him, so he has sent me a whole complete set of books for my birthday by a gentleman called Mr. Conrad. They all seem to be about ocean travel, although I have not had time to more than glance through them. I have always liked novels about ocean travel, ever since I posed for Mr. Christi, for the front cover of a novel about ocean travel by McGrath, because I always say that a girl never really looks as well as she does on board a steamship or even a yacht. So the English gentleman's name is Mr. Gerald Lamson, as those who have read his novels would know, and he also sent me some of his own novels as they seem to be about middle-age English gentleman who live in the country over in London and seemed to write bicycles, which seems quite different from America, except at Palm Beach. So I told Mr. Lamson how I write down all of my thoughts, and he said he knew I had something to me from the first minute he saw me, and when we become better acquainted, I am going to let him read my diary. I mean, I even told Mr. Isman about him, and he is quite pleased, because of course Mr. Lamson is quite famous, and it seems Mr. Isman has read all of his novels, going to and fro on the trains, and Mr. Isman is always anxious to meet famous people and take them to the Ritz to dinner on Saturday night. But of course, I did not tell Mr. Isman that I am really getting quite a little crush on Mr. Lamson, which I really believe I am, but Mr. Isman thinks my interest in him is more literary. March 30th, At last, Mr. Isman has left on the 20th century, and I must say, I am quite fatigued, and a little rest will be quite welcome. I mean, I do not mind staying out late every night if I dance, but Mr. Isman is really not such a good dancer. So most of the time we just sit and drink some champagne or have a bite to eat, and of course, I do not dance with anyone else when I am out with Mr. Isman. But Mr. Isman and Jerry, as Mr. Lamson wants me to call him, became quite good friends, and we had several evenings all three together. So now that Mr. Isman is out of town at last, Jerry and I are going out together this evening, and Jerry said not to dress up, because Jerry seems to like me more for my soul. So I really had to tell Jerry that if all the gentlemen were like he seems to be, Madam Francis's whole dress making establishment would have to go out of business, but Jerry does not like a girl to be nothing else but a doll, but he likes her to bring in her husband's slippers every evening, and make him forget what he has gone through. But before Mr. Isman went to Chicago, he told me that he is going to Paris this summer on professional business, and I think he intends to present me with a trip to Paris, as he says there is nothing so educational as traveling. I mean, it did worlds of good to Dorothy when she went abroad, mass-spring, and I never get tired of hearing her telling how the merry-go-rounds in Paris have pigs instead of horses. But I really do not know whether to be thrilled or not, because of course, if I go to Paris, I will have to leave Jerry, and both Jerry and I have made up our minds not to be separated from one another, from now on. March 31st, last night Jerry and I had dinner at quite a quaint place where we had roast beef and baked potato. I mean, he always wants me to have food, which is what he calls nourishing, which most gentlemen never seem to think about. So then we took a handsome cab and drove for hours around the park, because Jerry said the air would be good for me. It is really very sweet to have someone think of all those things that gentlemen hardly ever seem to think about. So then we talked quite a lot. I mean, Jerry knows how to draw a girl out, and I told him things that I really would not even put in my diary. So when he heard all about my life, he became quite depressed, and we both had tears in our eyes, because he said he never dreamed a girl could go through so much as I, and come out so sweet, and not made bitter by it all. I mean, Jerry thinks that most gentlemen are broots, and hardly ever think about a girl's soul. So it seems that Jerry has quite a lot of trouble himself, and he cannot even get married on account of his wife. He and she have never been in love with each other, but she was a suffragette and asked him to marry her, so what could he do? So we rode all around the park until quite late, talking and philosophizing quite a lot, and I finally told him that I thought, after all, that bird life was the highest form of civilization. So Jerry calls me his little thinker, and I really would not be surprised if all of my thoughts will give him quite a few ideas for his novels. Because Jerry says, he has never seen a girl of my personal appearance, with so many brains, and he had almost given up looking for his ideal, when our paths seemed to cross each other, and I told him I really thought a thing like that was nearly always the result of fate. So Jerry says that I remind him quite a lot of Helen of Troy, who was of Greek extraction. But the only Greek I know is a Greek gentleman by the name of Mr. George Opaulis, who was really quite wealthy, and he is what Dorothy and I call a shopper, because you can always call him up at any hour and ask him to go shopping, and he is always quite delighted, which very few gentlemen seem to be. And he never seems to care how much anything costs. I mean, Mr. George Opaulis is also quite cultured. As I know quite a few gentlemen who can speak to a waiter in French, but Mr. George Opaulis can also speak to a waiter in Greek, which very few gentlemen seem to be able to do. April 1st, I am taking special pains with my diary from now on, as I am really writing it for Jerry. I mean, he and I are going to read it together, some evening in front of the fireplace. But Jerry leaves this evening for Boston, as he has to lecture about all of his works at Boston, but he will rush right back as soon as possible. So I am going to spend all of my time improving myself while he is gone. And this afternoon, we are both going to a museum on Fifth Avenue, because Jerry wants to show me a very, very beautiful cup, made by an antique jeweler called Mr. Chilini. And he wants me to read Mr. Chilini's life, which is a very, very fine book, and not dull while he is in Boston. So the famous playwright friend of mine, who is called Sam, called up this morning, and he wanted me to go to a literary party tonight that he and some other literary gentlemen are giving to Florence Mills in Harlem, but Jerry does not want me to go with Sam, as Sam always insists on telling risk-a-s stories. But personally, I am quite broad-minded, and I always say that I do not mind a risk-a-s story, as long as it is really funny. I mean, I have a great sense of humor, but Jerry says Sam does not always select and choose his stories, and he just as soon as I did not go out with him. So I am going to stay home and read the book by Mr. Chilini instead. Because after all, the only thing I am really interested in is improving my mind. So I am going to do nothing else, but improve my mind while Jerry is in Boston. I mean, I just received a cable from Willy Quinn, who arrives from Europe tomorrow, but I am not even going to bother to see him. He is a sweet boy, but he never gets anywhere, and I am not going to waste my time on such as him after meeting a gentleman like Jerry. April 2nd, I seem to be quite depressed this morning, as I always am when there is nothing to put my mind to, because I decided not to read the book by Mr. Chilini. I mean, it was quite amusing in spots because it was really quite risky, but the spots were not so close together, and I never seemed to like to always be hunting clear through a book for the spots I am looking for, especially when there are really not so many spots that seem to be so amusing after all. So I did not waste my time on it, but this morning I told Lulu to let all of the house work go, and spend the day reading a book entitled, Lord Jim, and then tell me all about it, so that I would improve my mind while Jerry is away. But when I got her the book, I nearly made a mistake, and gave her a book by the title of the Nigger of Narcissus, which really would have hurt her feelings. I mean, I do not know why authors cannot say Negro, instead of Nigger, as they have their feelings just the same as we have. Well, I just got a telegram from Jerry, that he will not be back until tomorrow, and also some orchids from Willi-Gwin, so I may as well go to the theater with Willi tonight, to keep from getting depressed, as he really is a sweet boy after all. I mean, he never really does anything of noxious, and it is quite depressing to stay at home and do nothing but read, unless you really have a book that is worth bothering about. April 3rd, I was really so depressed this morning that I was even glad to get a letter from Mr. Isman, because last night, Willi-Gwin came to take me to the fallies, but he was so intoxicated that I had to telephone his club and send around a taxi to take him home. So that left me alone with Willi-Gwin, 9 o'clock with nothing to do. So I put in a telephone call for Boston to talk to Jerry, but it never went through. So Willi-Gwin tried to teach me how to play Majong, but I really could not keep my mind on it, because I was so depressed. So today, I think I had better go over to Madam Francis's, and order some new evening gowns to cheer me up. Well, Willi just brought me a telegram from Jerry that he will be in this afternoon, but I must not meet him at the station on account of all the reporters who always meet him at the station, wherever he comes from. But he says he will come right up to see me as he has something to talk about. April 4th, What an evening we had last evening. Hi, I mean, it seems that Jerry is madly in love with me, because all of the time he was in Boston lecturing to the women's clubs, he said, as he looked over the faces of all those club women in Boston, he never realized I was so beautiful. And he said that there was only one in the world, and that was me. But it seems that Jerry thinks that Mr. Iceman is terrible, and that no good can come of our friendship. I mean, I was quite surprised, as they both seemed to get along quite well together. But it seems that Jerry never wants me to see Mr. Iceman again, and he wants me to give up everything and study French, and he will get a divorce, and we will be married. Because Jerry does not seem to like the kind of life all of us lead in New York, and he wants me to go home to Papa in Arkansas, and he will send me books to read so that I will not get loaned some there. And he gave me his uncle's Masonic ring, which came down from the time of Solomon, and which he never even lets his wife wear, for our engagement ring. And this afternoon, a lady friend of his is going to bring me a new system as she thought up of how to learn French. But some way, I still seem to be depressed. I mean, I could not sleep all night thinking of the terrible things Jerry said about New York, and about Mr. Iceman. Of course, I can understand Jerry being jealous of any gentleman friend of mine, and of course, I never really thought that Mr. Iceman was rude all fell in Tino, but Jerry said it made him cringe to think of a sweet girl like I, having a friendship with Mr. Iceman. So it really made me feel quite depressed. I mean, Jerry likes to talk quite a lot, and I always think a lot of talking is depressing, and worries your brains with things you never even think of when you are busy. But so long as Jerry does not mind me going out with other gentlemen when they have something to give you mentally, I am going to luncheon with Eddie Goldmark of the Goldmark films, who is always wanting me to sign a contract to go into the cinema. Because Mr. Goldmark is madly in love with Dorothy, and Dorothy is always wanting me to go back to the cinema, because Dorothy says that she will go if I will go. April 6th. Well, I finally wrote Mr. Iceman that I was going to get married, and it seems that he is coming on at once, as he would probably like to give me his advice. Getting married is really quite serious, and Jerry talks to me for hours and hours about it. I mean, he never seems to get tired of talking, and he does not seem to even want to go to shows or dance, or do anything else but talk. And if I don't really have something definite to put my mind on soon, I will scream. April 7th. Well, Mr. Iceman arrived this morning, and he and I had quite a long talk, and after all, I think he is right. Because here's the first real opportunity I have ever really had. I mean to go to Paris and broaden out and improve my writing, and why should I give it up to Marion Author, where he is the whole thing, and all I would be, would be the wife of Gerald Lamsen. And on top of that, I would have to be dragged into the scandal of a divorce court and get my name smirched. So Mr. Iceman said that opportunities come to seldom in a girl's life. For me to give up the first one I have really ever had. So I am sailing for France and London on Tuesday, and taking Dorothy with me, and Mr. Iceman says that he will see us there later. So Dorothy knows all of the ropes, and she can get along in Paris just as though she knew French and the size. She knows a French gentleman who was born and raised there, who speaks it like a native, and knows Paris like a book, and Dorothy says that when we get to London, nearly everybody speaks English anyway. So it is quite lucky that Mr. Lamsen is out lecturing and Cincinnati, and he will not be back until Wednesday, and I can send him a letter and tell him that I have to go to Europe now, but I will see him later, perhaps. So anyway, I will be spared listening to any more of his depressing conversation. So Mr. Iceman gave me quite a nice drink of pearls, and he gave Dorothy a diamond pin, and we all went to the colony for dinner, and we all went to a show and supper at the Trocadero, and we all spent quite a pleasant evening.

The Romance of Modern Photography,Charles R. Gibson,29795,1.0,"November 16, 2022",[],0,"ase visit Librevox.org. Read by Piotr Mather. The Romance of Modern Photography by Charles R. Gibson. How photography came to be invented? There are few readers who require to have the general principles of photography explained to them. Most everyone is quite familiar with the dark camera, the exposure of the sensitized plate, the later developing and fixing of the image-bicamical processes thereby producing a negative. And finally, the paper picture obtained by contact printing by daylight. The general public were not always so well versed in photographic methods. I can well remember, some 20 years ago, when in country districts one found people surprised that the photographic artist could draw that quickly. The idea being that he drew the pictures by hand, the while he disappeared, beneath his focusing cloth. Once sometimes found well educated towns people failing to grasp the first principles of photography. I remember one incident when an early enthusiast was staying in the country. He wrote, asking a friend who was about to pay him a visit to bring with him some photographic plates. The friend, when he arrived, explained that these photographic plates had given him a fright. He had let them fall by accident, and fearing they might be broken, he had opened the box on the journey, and was quite relieved to find that there was not even a crack on any of the plates. We can imagine his feelings when he was informed that the plates having been once exposed to light were absolutely useless. We have become so accustomed to photography that it will be of interest to see how men discovered this art. We hardly expect to find that photography was invented by a certain man on a certain date, and yet there must have been a first photograph. Our difficulty is to know which of the early attempts we can really call a photograph. There are, however, a few names which stand out very prominently in connection with the invention of photography. All invention is more or less an evolution, a simple association of ideas. The ideas and discoveries of one generation lead on to the third or discoveries of this exceeding generation. In some cases, progress is very slow, while in others vast strides are rapidly made. Previous to the dawn of the 19th century, all scientific progress was necessarily slow, for information travelled very slowly. Men had to carry intelligence from one place to another. News could not then be flashed to the ends of the earth with lightning speed, nor did there exist any steamers to raise across the oceans. Just as in the case of electricity, we find an important discovery lying dormant for many centuries. So, we find the basis of photography discovered hundreds of years before there was any practical application. To those who have not already considered the matter, it may at first seem somewhat strange that the camera should have existed for nearly 300 years before photography was invented. In the middle of the 16th century, there lived an Italian philosopher, Batista Porta, who exhibited what we know as a camera obscura. All he did was to put a tightly fitting shutter on his window so that no light could enter, except by a small hole, which he had cut in the center of the shutter. This hole was in size rather less than what would permit the little finger to pass through. When this was done, there appeared upon the opposite wall of the room and inverted image of the outdoor scene, immediately in front of his window. Indeed there was a facsimile of the view he had from his window, except that everything was standing on its head. The philosopher went into raptures, crowds flocked to his house enables to see these pictures painted by light, glowing with color and marvelously accurate. It has been stated by many that Batista Porta invented the camera obscura, but there are records of such camera's prior to Porta's time. Many of us have probably seen the same phenomenon accidentally produced at one time or another. I can well remember, as clearly as though it were, but yesterday, when at the age of ten, I came downstairs early one bright summer morning, before the outer front door had been opened. I was very much surprised to see on the ground glass of the inner door and inverted image of the fields and trees in front of the house. Every detail being most faithfully reproduced. I can remember that I was not satisfied till I learned the cause of the picture being upside down. Now doubt the reason for this is patent to most readers, but if not, the matter will be made clear when we come to consider nature's camera. But this Porta caused the image to fall upon a wide surface so that the details might be more clearly seen, an experiment which may be very easily repeated by anyone. About this time it was also found that the image could be improved by placing a glass lens at the hole in the dark shutter. This gave a much brighter and what photographs call a sharper image. The lens was not a new invention. People were well acquainted with glass lenses. They were in common use long before this time, having been worn in spectacles for some 200s and 50 years before this. The idea of glass lenses, where we have to focus light, must have been a very early origin. For there may be seen in the Assyrian Department of the British Museum, a glass lens which was found in the ruins of Nenewe, year 1000 BC. That great city on the top of whose high walls three chariot could drive a breast around the 60-milser conference. There is of course the possibility that this ancient lens was merely used as an ornament. The interaction of the lens into the camera obscura still left the image upside down. A mirror placed close to the lens, caused the light to be thrown down through the lens on to a horizontal table, instead of its falling upon the upright wall. The observer could then view the picture in its natural position by merely taking his stand at the base of it, without the necessity of standing on his head. When it became known that the necessary apparatus was so very simple, these dark chambers or camera obscuras became a source of amusement in the country houses of the wealthy. We still find a few such instruments exhibited in large cities by way of entertainment. I remember how many years ago one of my mother's maids returned from a visit to this cottage capital filled with delight and wonderments at what she had seen at the dispensary. It seems strange that the girl should have included a dispensary in her sightseeing, but on cross-examination it was found to be a camera obscura. Possibly her idea was that the light dispensed the picture upon the table. The idea of trying to catch and fix these pictures of nature may have occurred to many, but to the majority of people it would seem an absolute impossibility. Some early writers of fiction described nature herself producing pictures. Supposedly the idea was suggested by this 16th century camera obscuras. Late in the 17th century one writer imagines himself transported to a far-country, where pictures were produced in the following manner. Great vessels made of gold and silver were filled with water. The surface of the water reflected this surrounding scene, but strange to say, the water then froze, entertained the picture permanently. But the metal of the 18th century, another writer of fiction dreams, he is in the very heart of Africa, where he is conducted by his guide into a darkened chamber. He saw out of a window a great sea, which seemed to be a quarter of the mildestant. We can imagine his surprise upon seeing the ocean in the center of Africa. It seemed to him a miracle, as his own words will show. I hastily ran to convince my eyes of so improbable a thing, but in trying to put my head out of the window I knocked it against something that felt like a wall. Stand with the blow, and still more with so many mysteries I drew back a few paces. Thy hairy, said the guide, occasions they mistake. That window, the vast horizon, those black clouds, the raging sea, are all but a picture. The elementary spirits have composed a most subtle matter by the help of which a picture is made in the twinkle of an eye. They do all over with this matter a piece of canvas, and hold it before the objects they have in mind to paint. The first effect of the canvas is that of a mirror, but what the class cannot do, the canvas, by means of the viscous matter, retains the image. The impression of the images is made, the first instance they are received on the canvas, which is immediately carried away into some dark place. On our after, the subtle matter dies, and you have a picture so much, the more valuable, as it cannot be imitated by art, or destroyed by time. So runs the tale, which was written by Define de la Roche in 1760 under the title of Gifantique. This was assuredly a fancivil dream, and yet it is a fair description or prediction of what we have now accomplished. How many people may have made serious attempts to fix the image of the camera obscura is not known. At least three experimenters were successful, and of these two were natives of France, while the third was the grandson of an English Earl. What is the earliest date at which photography became possible? One might say that it would have been quite possible for Batista Porta to have in some measure fixed his nature's drawings as the necessary chemicals were known then to the alchemists. There is a legend that, just about the same time that this famous Italian philosopher was exhibiting his camera obscura, one of these alchemists, who was seeking in vain for the philosophers stone, or the alixirwita, changed to drops some ordinary sea salt into a solution of silver nitrate, where upon the liquid became white like milk. This phenomenon by itself would not astonish the alchemist, but he observed that when sunlight fell upon this white liquid, it very quickly turned black. However, as this new phenomenon did not seem to lead towards either of the goals for which the alchemist was striving, he did not recognise of much importance. These old time alchemists, whereby no means all rogues or charlatans, many of them, earnestly sought after the philosophers stone and the alixirwita. They really believed that they might succeed in transmuting the baser metals into precious gold and silver, and that they might also discover some panacea, which would prolong life indefinitely. With the recent discoveries of radium and radioactivity, who can say that man may not some day see such transmutations of metals. We now see the immutable atom of a few years ago, breaking up into other forms of matter. It is true, this newly discovered action of nature is only a transmutation on a very small scale, but scientists are not going to be dogmatic and say that it will forever be impossible to haze in this process. Many scientists of a century ago even believed photography to be forever an impossible thing. I imagine that as regards the second goal of the alchemist, the definite prolongation of life, the most of us are ready to be dogmatic despite the ingenious suggestions of Professor Mechnikov of the Paster Institute. This learned gentleman believes that where it permissible to prepare certain serums and inject them into the human body, all the age would be defied. However, to return to the alchemists, we find that they treated the study of chemical phenomena in very much the same spirit as the astrologers looked upon in all of the stars. To the astrologer, the only useful purpose in the study of the heavenly bodies was to enable him to fortale future events and perchance in some mysterious way to influence them. So it was, with the alchemist, he treated his discoveries lightly, if they did not seem to take him nearer his twofold goal. Nevertheless, these men made many discoveries which are of much importance to us today. Despite the existence of the legend to which I have referred, it seems doubtful whether or not the alchemists were really aware of the action of light upon silver salts. Although it is certain that these men made silver nitrate. In any case, it was well known in the 16th century that silver ore sometimes changed color when brought up from the mines. If the alchemists did know of this property of silver salts, it is clear that they did not consider the phenomenon of much importance. It is certain that the subject did not attract any attention. It is interesting to note that the German physician, some two centuries later, amused his friends by making a mixture of chalk and silver nitrate in a bottle and then exposing the bottle to sunlight. He cut out designs and words in cardboard after the manner of stencils and when he allowed sunlight to shine through these upon the contents of his bottle, they appeared the same design or word in black upon the chemical mixture. Shaking the bottle well caused the image to disappear, where upon the bottle was ready for another performance. It has been suggested that this man should be called the inventor of photography, but he really only invented a conjuring trick. Leaving the alchemists out of account, this man may have been the first to note the darkening effect of light. Early in the 19th century, Weddwood, a son of the famous English potter, made some interesting experiments with silver salts. Weddwood was assisted in some of these experiments by the great Sir Humphrey Davy, who did so much pioneer work for chemistry and electricity. These two experimenters coated paper and also white leather with a weak solution of silver salts. They then laid opaque objects upon the prepared surface and thus caused the shadows of the objects to imprint themselves. In other words, the paper turned black on exposure to light, except at those places where the paper was protected from the light by the intervening objects. The result was a white print upon a black ground. These experimenters tried some of their prepared paper in a camera obscura, but without any result. Their failure was no doubt due to the warmth of intensity in the light, which passed into the camera obscura. For Davy, afterwards succeeded in producing images of objects placed in a solar microscope, which had a more concentrated light. With a modern camera and ordinary photographic paper, it is quite easy to take a photograph directly onto the paper in the camera, provided a sufficiently long exposure is given. But with Ant Davy succeeded in copying paintings on glass by placing them in contact with a sensitized paper, but they do not seem to have considered the subject to be of much practical importance. They were not able to fix the image permanently. The lights soon blackened the whole paper and therefore destroyed the picture. One may be a little surprised that our illustrious chemist, Humphrey Davy, did not devise some means of fixing the paper print, and the surprise is increased when one learns that all that was really necessary was to dip the print in salt water. Weddwood and Davy did make some attempts to fix the picture by washing the prints thoroughly and by coating the surface with varnish, but these methods failed to prevent the further action of light. Referring to the possibility of fixing such prints, Davy wrote, only this is wanting to render the process as useful as it is elegant. I had said that one may be surprised to learn that Davy failed in overcoming so simple and abstraction, but I cannot think that he really gave the matter any very earnest attention for he was at this time deep in chemical and electrochemical research work, which no doubt appealed to him as being a far greater importance. It may be remarked in passing that these experiments made by Weddwood and Davy had also been made abroad more than half a century previously, but these two English experimenters do not appear to have been aware of this fact. This is how matters stood at the beginning of the 19th century, and indeed at the time when our late Queen Victoria was a girl. Then followed three separate romances to discover his of Nips, Dogale and Stylbot, the three pioneers already referred to, the first to being French and the third in English men.

Part 1. He walks slowly like a man plotting knee deep through the thick stuff of nightmares. There was no definite line between the dream state and wakefulness. Only a donny knowledge that he was finally conscious and would have to do something about it. He opened his eyes, but this made no difference. The blackness remained. The pain in his head brightened and he reached up and found the big lump they'd evidently put on his head for good measure, a margin of safety. They must have been prudent people, because the bang on the head had hardly been necessary. The spike drink which they had given him would have fell in ox. He remembered going down into the darkness after drinking it, and of knowing what it was. He remembered the helpless feeling. It did not worry him now. He was a philosophical person and the fact that he was still alive canceled out the drink and its result. He thought with saver of the chest-not-haired girl who had watched him take the drink. She had worn a very low bodice and that was where his eyes had been at the last moment on the beautiful tan breasts until they wavered and puddled into a blur and then into nothing. The chest-not-haired girl had been nice, but now she was gone and there were more pressing problems. He sat up, his hands behind him at the ends of stiff arms, climbed into long and disturbed dust and filth. His movements stirred the dust and it rose into his nostrils. He strengthened and bang his head against the low ceiling. The pain made him sick for a minute and he sat down to regain his senses. He cursed the ceiling, as a matter of course, in an agonized whisper. Ready to move again, he got onto his hands and knees and crawled cautiously forward, exploring as he went. His hand pushed through cobwebs and found a rough cement wall. He went around and around. It was all cement, all solid. Hell, they hadn't sealed him up in this place. There had been way in so there had to be a way out. He went around again. Then he tried the ceiling and found the opening. A wooden trap covering a four by four hole, covering it snugly. He pushed the trap away and daylight streamed in. He raised himself up until he was eye-level with a discarded shaving cream jar lying on the bricks of an alley. He could read the trademark on the jar and the slogan, for the meticulous man. He pulled himself up into the alley. As a result of an orderly childhood, he replaced the wooden trap and kicked the shaving cream jar against a garbage can. He rubbed his chin and looked up and down the alley. It was high noon, an uncoverson blazed down to tell him this. And there was no one in sight. He started walking toward the near mouth of the alley. He had been in that hole a long time, he decided. This conviction came from his hunger and the heavy growth of beard he'd sprouted. 24 hours, maybe longer. That Mickey must have been a lulu. He walked out into the cross street. It was empty. No people, no cars parked at the curbs. Only a cat washing its dirty face on a tenement stoop across the street. He looked up at the tenement windows. They stared back. There was an empty deserted look about them. The cat flowed down the front steps of the tenement and away toward the rear and he was truly alone. He rubbed his harsh chin. Must be Sunday, he thought. Then he knew it could not be Sunday. He'd gone into the tavern on a Tuesday night. That would make it five days, too long. He had been walking and now he was at an intersection where he could look up and down a new street. There were no cars, no people, not even a cat. A sign overhanging the sidewalk said, restaurant. He went in under the sign and tried the door. It was locked. There were no lights inside. He turned away, grinning to reassure himself. Everything was all right. Just some kind of a holiday. In a big city like Chicago, the people go away on hot summer holidays. They go to the beaches and the parks and sometimes you can't see a living soul on the streets. And of course you can't find any cars because the people used them to drive to the beaches and the parks and out into the country. He breathed a little easier and started walking again. Sure, that was it. Now what the hell holiday was it? He tried to remember. He couldn't think of what holiday it could be. Maybe they dreamed up a new one. He grand at that, but the grand was a little tight and he had to force it. He forced it carefully until his teeth showed white. Pretty soon he would come to a section where everybody hadn't gone to the beaches and parks and a restaurant would be open and he'd get a good meal. A meal? He fumbled toward his pockets. He dug into them and found a hand kershift and a button from his cuff. He remembered that the button had hung loose so he'd pulled it off to keep from losing it. He hadn't lost the button, but everything else was gone. He scowled. The least they could have done was to leave a man eating money. He turned another corner into another street and it was like the one before. No cars, no people, not even any cats. Panic welled up. He stopped and whirled around to look behind him. No one was there. He walked in a tight circle looking in all directions. The windows stared back at him. Eyes that didn't care where everybody had gone or when they would come back. The windows could wait. The windows were not hungry. Their heads didn't ache. They weren't scared. He began walking his path veered outward from the sidewalk until he was in the exact center of the silent street. He walked down the warn white line. When he got to the next corner, he noticed that the traffic signals were not working. Black empty eyes. His pace quickened. He walked faster. Ever faster until he was trotting on the brittle pavement. His sharp steps echoing against the buildings. Faster. Another corner. And he was running filled with panic down the empty street. The girl opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling. The ceiling was a blur but it began to clear as her mind cleared. The ceiling became a surface of dirty crack plaster and there was a feeling of dirt and squaller in her mind. It was always like that at these times of awakening, but doubly bitter now because she had never expected to awaken again. She reached down and pull the watered sheet from beneath her legs and spread it over them. She looked at the bottle on the shabby bed table. There were three sleeping pills left in it. The girl's eyes clouded with resentment. You think seven pills would have done it. She reached down and took the sheet with both hands and drew it taught over her stomach. This was a gesture of frustration. Seven hadn't been enough and here she was again, awaken the world she wanted to leave. A wake with a necessary edge of determination gone. She pulled the sheet into a watered through it at the wall. She got up and walked to the window and looked out. Bright daylight. She wondered how long she had slipped. A long time no doubt. Her naked thigh pressed against the window seal and her bare stomach touched the dirty pain. Naked in the window, but it didn't matter because it gave onto an air shaft and other windows so caked with grime as if to be of no value as windows. But even aside from that, it didn't matter. It didn't matter in the least. She went to the washstand, her bare feet making no sound on the worn rug. She turned on the faucets, but no water came. No water and she had a terrible thirst. She went to the door and had thrown the bolt before she remembered again that she was naked. She turned back and saw the half empty Pepsi-Colaboddle on the floor beside the bed table. Someone else had left it there. How many nights ago? But she drank it anyhow. Even though it was flat and warm, it suathed her throat. She banned over to pick up garments from the floor and dizziness came, forcing her to the edge of the bed. After a while it passed and she got her legs into one of the garments and pulled it on. Taking cosmetics from her bag, she went again to the washstand and tried the taps. Still no water. She combed her hair, jerking the comb through the mats and norals with the satisfying viciousness. When the hair fell into his natural, blonde curls, she applied powder and lipstick. She went back to the bed, picked up her berser and began putting it on as she walked to the cracked full-length mirror on the closet door. With the berser in place, she stood looking at her slim image. She assayed herself with complete impersonality. She shouldn't look as good as she did, not after the beating she'd taken. Not after the long nights in the days and the years, even though the years did not add up to very many. She could be someone's wife, she thought, with right humor. I could be sending kids to school and going out to argue with the grocer about the tomatoes being too soft. I don't look bad at all. She raised her eyes until they were staring into their own images in the glass and she spoke aloud in a low, wondering voice. She said, who the hell am I anyway? Who am I? A body named Linda? That's who I am? No. That's what I am. A body, not a who? It's a what? 114 pounds of well-built blonde body called Linda, model 1931. No fender dance. Nice paint job. Come in and drive me away. A, price tag. She bid into the lower lip she just finished reddening and turned quickly to walk to the bed and wriggle into her dress. A gray and green cotton. The only one she had. She picked up her bag and went to the door. There she stopped to turn and thumb her nose at the three sleeping pills in the bottle before she went out and closed the door after herself. The desk clerk was away from the cubby hole from which he presided over the lobby and there were no loungers to undress her as she walked toward the door. Nor was there anyone out in the street. The girl looked north and south. No cars inside either. No buses waddling up to the curb to spew out passengers. The girl went five doors north and tried to enter a place called Tim's hamburger house. As the lock held and the door refused to open, she saw that there were no lights on inside. No one behind the counter. The place was closed. She walked on down the street, followed only by the lonesome sound of her own clicking heels. All the stores were closed. All the lights were out. All the people were gone. He was a huge man and the place of concealment of the Chicago Avenue police station was very small. Nearly an indentation low in the cement wall behind two steam pipes. The big man had laying in this niche for 48 hours. He had slugged a man or the turn of a card in a pool room pinnacle game. Had been arrested and do course and was awaiting the disposal of his case. He was sorry he had slugged a man. He had not had any depaidred for him, but rather a rage of the moment that demanded violence as its outlet. Although he did not consider it a matter of any great importance, he did not look forward to the six month jail sentence he would doubtless be given. His opportunity to hide in the niche had come as accidentally and as suddenly as his opportunity to slug his card partner. It had come after the prisoners had been advised of the crisis and were being heard in advance for transportation elsewhere. He had snatched the opportunity without giving any consideration whatever to the crisis. Probably because he did not have enough imagination to fear anything, however terrible, which mind a car in the future. And because he treasured his freedom above all else, freedom for today, tomorrow could take care of itself. Now, after forty-eight hours, he rithed and twisted his huge body out of the niche and onto the floor of the furnace room. His legs were nomin he found that he could not stand. He managed to sit up and was able to bend his back and off so his great hands could reach his legs and begin to massage life back into them. So, he'll mentally brutal was this man that he pounded his legs and tell the were black and blue before feeling returned to them. In a few minutes he was walking out of the furnace room through the jailhouse which should now be utterly deserted. But was it? He went slowly, gliding along close to the walls to reach the front door unchallenged. He walked out into the street. It was daylight and the street was completely deserted. The man took a deep breath and grand. All be damned, he muttered. I'll be double and triple damned. They're all gone. Every damn one of them run off like rats and I'm the only one left. All be damned. A tremendous sense of exaltation ceased him. He clenched his fists and laughed loud, his laugh echoing up the street. He was happier than he had ever been in his quick, violent life. And his joy was that of a child locked in a pantry with a huge chocolate cake. He rubbed a hand across his mouth, looked up the street, began walking. I wonder if they took all the whiskey with them, he said. Then he grand, he was sure they had not. He began walking in long strides toward Clark Street, into ward the still heart of the empty city. He was a slim, pale-skinned little man and very dangerous. He was also very clever. Eventually they would have found out, but he had been clever enough to deceive them and now they would never know. There was great wealth in his family, and with the rest of them occupied with leaving the city and taking what valuables they could on such short notice, he had been put in charge of one of the chauffeurs. The chauffeur had been given the responsibility of getting the pale-skinned young man out of the city, but the young man had caused several delays until all the rest were gone. Then, meekly enough, he had accompanied the chauffeur to the garage. The chauffeur got behind the wheel of the last remaining car, a Cadillac sedan, and the young man had gotten into the rear seat. But before the chauffeur could start the motor, the young man hit him on the head with a tire bar he had taken from a shelf as they had entered the garage. The bar went deep into the chauffeur's skull with a saw at sound, and thus the chauffeur found the death he was in the very act of fleeing. The young man pulled the dead chauffeur from the car and laid him on the cement floor. He laid him down very carefully so that he was in the exact center of a large square of outlined cement with his feet pointing straight north and his outstretched arms pointing south. The young man placed the chauffeur's cap very carefully upon his chest because neatness pleased him. Then he got into the car, started it, and headed east toward Lake Michigan and the downtown section. After traveling three or four miles, he turned the car off the road and drove it into a telephone post. Then he walked until he came to some high weeds. He laid down in the weeds and waited. He knew there would probably be a last vanguard of Malaysia hunting for stragglers. If they saw a moving car they would investigate. They would take him and custody and force him to leave the city. This he felt they had no right to do. All his life had been ordered about, told to do this and that and the other thing. Stupid orders from stupid people. Idiots who went so far as to claim the whole city would be destroyed, just to make people do as they said. God, the ends to which stupid people would go in order to assert their wills over brilliant people. The young man lay in the weeds and dosed off. His mind occupied with the pleasant memory of the tire iron settling into the skull of the chauffeur. After a while he awoke and heard the cars of the last vanguard passing down the road. They stopped, inspected the cattle act and found it serviceable. They took it with them, but they did not search the weeds along the road. When they had disappeared toward the west, the young man came back to the road and began walking east, intoward the city. Complete destruction in two days? Propostrous. The young man smiled. The girl was afraid. For hours she had walked the streets of the empty city and the fear, strengthened by wearing us, was now mounting toward terror. One face she whispered, just one person coming out of a house or walking across the street. That's all I ask. Someone to tell me what this is all about. If I can find one person, I won't be afraid anymore. And the irony of its struck her. A few hours previously she had attempted suicide. Sick of herself and of all the people she had tried to end her own life. Therefore, by acknowledging death as the answer, she should now have no fear whatever of anything. Reconciled to crossing the bridge into death, no facet of life should have held terror for her. But the empty city did hold terror. One face, one moving form, was all she asked for. Then a second irony. When she saw the man at the corner of Washington and Wells, her terror increased. They saw each other at almost the same moment. Both stopped and stared. Fingers of panic ran up the girl's spine. The man raised a hand and the spell was broken. The girl turned and ran. And there was more terror in her than there had been before. She knew how absurd this was, but still she ran blindly. What had she to fear? She knew all about men. All the things men could do they had already done to her. Murder was the ultimate, but she was fresh from a suicide attempt. Death should hold no terrors for her. She thought of these things as the man's foot steps sounded behind her and she turned into a narrow alley seeking a hiding place. She found none and the man turned in after her. She found a passageway, entered with the same blindness which had brought her into the alley. There was a steel door at the end and a brick lying by the sill. The door was locked. She picked up the brick and turned. The man skitted on the filthy alley surface as he turned into the areaway. The girl raised the brick over her head. Keep away, stay away from me. Wait a minute, take it easy. I'm not going to hurt you. Get away. Her arm moved downward. The man rushed in and caught her wrist. The brick went over his shoulder and the nails of her other hand raked his face. He seized her without regard for niceties and they went to the ground. She fought with everything she had and he methodically neutralized all her weapons. Her hands, her legs, her teeth until she could not move. Leave me alone, please. What's wrong with you? I'm not going to hurt you, but I'm not going to let you hit me with a brick either. What do you want? Why did you chase me? Look, I'm a peaceful guy, but I'm not going to let you get away. I spent all afternoon looking for somebody. I found you and you ran away. I came after you. I haven't done anything to you. That silly talk. Come on, grow up. I said I'm not going to hurt you. Let me up. So you can run away again? Not for a while. I want to talk to you. I won't run. I was scared and I don't know why. You're hurting me. He got up gingerly and lifted her to her feet. He smiled, still holding both her hands. I'm sorry. I guess it's natural for you to be scared. My name is Frank Brooks. I just want to find out what they all happened to this town. He led her with draw her hands, but he still blocked her escape. She moved a pace backward and straightened her clothing. I don't know what happened. I was looking for someone too. He smiled again and then you ran. I don't know why. I guess what's your name? Nora, Nora Spade. You slept through a two? Yes. Yes. I slept through it and came out and they were all gone. Let's get out of this alley. He proceeded her out, but he waited for her when there was room for them to walk side by side and she did not try to run away. That phase was evidently over. I got slipped a Mickey and a tavern, Frank Brooks said, then they slugged me and put me in a hole. His eyes questioned. She felt their demand and said, I was asleep in my hotel room. They overlooked you? I guess so. Then you don't know anything about it? Nothing. Something terrible must have happened. Let's go down this way, Frank said, and they moved toward Madison Street. He had taken her arm and she did not pull away. Rather, she walked in vitally close to him. She said, it's so spooky, so empty. I guess that's what scared me. It would scare anybody. There must have been an evacuation of some kind. And maybe the Russians are going to drop a bomb. Frank shook his head. That wouldn't explain it. I mean, the Russians wouldn't let us know ahead of time. Besides, the army would be here. Everybody wouldn't be gone. There's been a lot of talk about germ warfare. Do you suppose the water maybe has been poisoned? He shook his head. The same thing holds true. Even if they moved the people out, the army would be here. I don't know. It just doesn't make sense. It happened, so it has to make sense. It was something that came up all of a sudden. They didn't have much more than 24 hours. He stopped suddenly and looked at her. We've got to get out of here. Norris paid smile for the first time, but without humor. How, I haven't seen one car. The bus isn't running. His mind was elsewhere. They had started walking again. Funny, I didn't think of that before. Think of what? That anybody left in this town as a dead pigeon. The only reason they clear out of city would be to get away from certain death. That would mean death is here for anybody that stays. Funny, I was so busy looking for somebody to talk to that I never thought of that. I did. Is that what you were scared of? Not particularly, I'm not afraid to die. It was something else that scared me. The aloneness, I guess. We'd better start walking west out of the city. Maybe we'll find a car or something. I don't think we'll find any cars. He drew her to a haul and looked into her face. You aren't afraid at all, are you? She thought for a moment. No, I guess I'm not. Not of dying that is. Dying is a normal thing, but I was afraid of the empty streets. Nobody around. That was weird. It isn't weird now. Not as much. I wonder how much time we've got. Noris shrugged. I don't know, but I'm hungry. We can fix that. I broke into a restaurant of a few blocks back and got myself a sandwich. I think there's still food around. They couldn't take it all with them. They were on Madison Street and they turned east on the south side of the street. Noris said, I wonder if there's any other people still here, like us. I think there must be. Not very many, but a few. They would have had to clean 4 million people out overnight. It stands to reason they must have missed a few. Did you ever try to empty a sack of sugar? Really empty it? It's impossible. Some of the grains always stick to the sack. A few minutes later, the wisdom of this observation was proven when they came to a restaurant with a front window broken out and saw a man and a woman sitting at one of the tables. He was a huge man with a shock of black hair and a mouth slightly open, showing a set of incredibly white teeth. He waved an arm and shouted, come on in, come on in for Christ's sake and sit down. We got beer and roast beef and the beer still cold. Come on in and meet Mina. This was different, Northought. Not airy. Not weird, like seen a man standing on a deserted street corner with no an else around. This seemed normal, natural, and even the smashed window didn't detract too much from the naturalness. They went inside. There were chairs at the table and they sat down. The big man did not get up. He waved a hand toward his companion and said, this is Mina. Ain't she something? I found her sitting at an empty bar scared death. We came to an understanding and I brought her along. He grinned at the woman and winked. We came to a real understanding, didn't we, Mina? Mina was a completely colorless woman of perhaps 35. Her skin was smooth and pale and she wore no makeup of any kind. Her hair was drawn straight back into a bun. The hair had no predominating color. It was somewhere between light brown and blonde. She smiled a little sadly, but the laugh did not cover her worn, tired look. It seemed more like a gesture of obedience than anything else. Yes, we came to an understanding. I'm Jim Wilson, the big man boomed. I was in the Chicago Avenue jog for slugging a guy in a card game. They kind of overlooked me when they cleaned the joint out. He winked again. I kind of helped them overlooked me. Then I found Mina. There was a tremendous relish in his words. Frank started introductions which Norris paid cut in on. Maybe you know what happened? She asked. Wilson shook his head. I was in the jog and they didn't tell us. They just started cleaning out the joint. There was talk in the bullpen and invasion or something. Nobody knew for sure. Have some bear and meat. Nor returned to the quiet Mina. Did you hear anything? Nah, Wilson said with a kind of affectionate contempt. She don't know anything about it. She lived in some attic dump and was down with the sore throat. She took some pills or something and when she woke up they were gone. I went to work and Mina began but Wilson cut her off. She swaps out some joint San Chicago Avenue for living and that was how she happened to be sitting in that tavern. It's payday and Mina was waiting for her doll. Exploaded into laughter and slapped the table with a huge hand. Can you beat that? Waiting for her payday time like this. Frank broke set down his beer bottle. The beer was cold and it tasted good. Have you met anybody else? There must be some other people around. Uh-huh. Haven't met anybody but Mina. He turned his eyes on the woman again, then got to his feet. Come on Mina. You and I got to have a little conference. We got things to talk about. Grining, he walked toward the rear of the restaurant. Mina got up more slowly. She followed him behind the counter and into the rear of the place. Along with Nora, Frank said, you aren't eating. Want me to look for something else? No, I'm not very hungry. I was just wondering. Wondering about what? When it will happen, when whatever's going to happen, you know what I mean? I'd rather know what's going to happen. I hate puzzles. It's hell to have to get killed and not know what killed you. We aren't being very sensible, are we? How do you mean? We should at least act normal. I don't get it. Nora frowned in slight annoyance. Normal people would be trying to reach safety. They wouldn't be sitting in a restaurant drinking beer. We should be trying to get away. Even if it does mean walking, normal people would be trying to get away. Frank stared at his bottle for a moment. We should be scared stiff, shouldn't we? It was Nora's turn to ponder. I'm not sure. Maybe not. I know I'm not fighting anything inside. Fear, I mean. I just don't seem to care one way or the other. I care, Frank replied. I care, I don't want to die. But we're faced with a situation, and either way it's a gamble. We might be dead before I finish this bottle of beer. If that's true, why not sit here and be comfortable? Or we might have time to walk far enough to get out of range of whatever it is that chased everybody. Which way do you think it is? I don't think we have time to get out of town. They cleaned it out too fast. We need at least four or five hours to get away. If we had that much time the army, or whoever did it, would still be around. Maybe they didn't know themselves when it's going to happen. He made an impatient gesture. What difference does this make? Where in a situation we didn't ask to get in? Our luck put us here, and I'm damned if I'm going to kick a hole in the ceiling in Yelford Hill. Nor was going to reply, but at that moment Jim Wilson came stridey now at front. He was big grin and he carried another half dozen bottles of beer. Mean all be out in a minute, he said, women are always slower than hell. He dropped into a chair and snapped the cap off a beer bottle with his thumb. He held the bottle up and squinted through it, signed gustally. Man, I ain't never had it so good. He tilted the bottle in salute and drank.

A Little Garland of Christmas Verse,Various,2507,,"November 11, 2022",[],0,"please visit Librevox.org. Read by ELPents. A little Garland of Christmas Verses by various authors. They all were looking for a king to slay their foes and lift them high. Now camest a little baby thing that made a woman cry. O son of man to write my lot, not but thy presence can avail. Yet on the road thy wheels are not. Nor on the sea thy sail. My how are wind thou wilt not heed. But come down thine on secret stare, that thou mayst answer all my need. Get every bygone prayer. George McDonald. Proham. The Christmas rose. In the great garden of the world of bloom, behold a rose. Fair with white hopes that smile away all gloom. Leading us on to that vast and tavern of the watcher nose. In the great garden of the deathless flowers, we call our sweet. Through the long glimmer of the fading hours, petals from our star blooms in ceaseless showers, fall at our feet. In the great garden of the flowers white, we kneel with tears. Watch through the mist of long and mournful night, so that at last we pour, may greet the light, when it appears. In the great garden, there are blooms and mold the watcher nose. That from the earth prepared yet dark and cold, supreme as deathless hope there will unfold, the Christmas rose. In the great garden of the wondrous store, we wonder free. What though the press be over-great and sore? Here is our peace, here watch we ever more, expectantly. In the great garden is a secret fair, the watcher nose. Watch thin and learn. There is no garden bear. Life and eternity together share. A Christmas rose. Anonymous. When Christ was born of Mary-free, in Bethlehem, in that fair city, Angel sung in with Murth and Glee, in Excellus Gloria. Herdsman beheld these angels bright, to them appeared with great light, and said, God's Son is born this night. In Excellus Gloria, this king is coming to save kind, even in scripture as we find. Therefore, this song have we in mind. In Excellus Gloria. Then dear Lord for thy great grace, grant us in bliss to see thy face, where we may sing to thee, solace, in Excellus Gloria. Harlean manuscript, AD 1500. God rest you Mary-Gentwoman. Let nothing you dismay. For Jesus Christ our Savior was born upon this day. To save us all from Satan's power, when we were gone astray. O tidings of comfort and joy. For Jesus Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day. In Bethlehem, in jewelry, this blessed babe was born, and laid within a manger. Upon this blessed mourn, the witch his mother Mary, nothing did take in scorn. O tidings, etc. From God our heavenly Father, a blessed angel came, and unto certain shepherds, brought tidings of the same, how that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name. O tidings, etc. Fear not, then said the angel, let nothing you afrite. This day is born a Savior, a virtue, power, and might. So frequently to vanquish all the friends of Satan quite. O tidings, etc. The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind, and left their flocks of feeding, in tempest storm and wind, and went to Bethlehem straight way, this blessed babe to find. O tidings, etc. But when to Bethlehem they came, were at the sinful lay. They found him in a manger, were oxen feed on hay. His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray. O tidings, etc. Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place, and with true love and brotherhood, each other now embrace, this holy tide of Christmas, all others' death deface. O tidings of comfort and joy, for Jesus Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day. Anonymous, 1,500 AD. Cradle him. Away in a manger, no crib for a bed. The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay. The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes. But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes. I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky, and stay by my cradle till morning is night. Martin Luther. For Christmas day. Immortal babe, who this dear day, didch change thy heaven for our clay, and didst with flesh thy godhead veil, eternal son of God, all hail. Shiny happy star, he angels sing, glory on high to heaven's king. Run shepherds leave your nightly watch, see heaven come down to Bethlehem's crotch. Worship, he sages of the east, the king of gods in meanness dressed, a blessed maid, smile and adore, the god thy womb and arms have bore. Star, angels, shepherds and wise sages, thou virgin glory of all ages, restored frame of heaven and earth, joy in your dear Redeemer's birth. Bishop Hall. A hymn for Christmas day. Hark the glad sound, the Savior comes, the Savior promised long, let every heart prepare a throne, and every voice a song. He comes the prisoners to release in Satan's bondage held, the gates of brass before him burst, the iron fetters yield. He comes the broken heart to bind, the bleeding soul to cure, and with the treasures of his grace, to enrich the humble poor. Our glad Hosanna's prince of peace thy welcome shall proclaim, and heavens eternal arch is ring, with thy beloved name. Philip Daudridge. Christmas him. While shepherds watch their flock by night, I'll see it on the ground. The angel of the Lord came down and glories shone around. Fear not, said he, for mighty dread, had seized their troubled mind. Glad tidings of great joy I bring to you, and all mankind. To you, in David's town this day, is born of David's line, the Savior who is Christ the Lord, and this shall be the sign. The heavenly babe, you there shall find, to human view displayed, all meanly wrapped in swathing bands, and in a manger laid. Thus spake the seraph and forthwith, appear to shining throng, of angels praising God, and thus addressed their joyful song. I'll glory be to God on high and to the earth be peace. Good will henceforth from heaven to men, begin and never cease. Nehum Tate. A cradle song. Hush my dear, lie still in slumber, holy angels guard thy bed. Heavenly blessings without number gently falling on thy head. Sleep my babe thy food and raimant house in home thy friends provide, all without thy care or payment, all thy wants are well supplied. How much better thou art attended than the son of God could be, when from heaven he descended, and became a child like thee. Soft and easy as thy cradle, course and hard thy Savior lay, when his birthplace was a stable, and his softest bed was hay. See the kinder shepherd's round him, telling wonders from the sky, where they sought him, where they found him, with the virgin mother by. See the lovely babe addressing, lovely infant how he smiled, when he wept his mother's blessing, soothed and hushed the holy child. Low he slumbers in his manger, where the horned ox and fed, peace my darling, here's no danger, here's no ox and your thy bed. May thou live to know and fear him, trust and love him all by days, then go dwell forever near him, see his face and sing his praise. I could give thee thousand kisses, hoping what I most desire, not a mother's fondest wishes, can to greater joys a spire. Eyes aquatts. Hark, the Harold Angel's sing. Hark, the Harold Angel's sing.

Memories of My Life,Sarah Bernhardt,2496,1.0,"November 11, 2022",[],0,"Vox.org. Memories of My Life by Sara Bernard. Chapter 1 My Arms Another was fond of traveling. She would go from Spain to England, from London to Paris, from Paris to Berlin and from there to Christiania. Then she would come back and brace me and sit out again for Holland, her native country. She used to send my nurse clothing for herself and cakes for me. To one of my aunts she would ride, look after little Sarpá, my sheltered her in a month's time. On myth later she would ride to another of her sisters, go and see the child that her nurses, I shall be back in a couple of weeks. My mother's age was 19, I was three years old, and my two aunts were 17 and 20 years of age. Another aunt was 15 and the other this was 28, but the latter lived at Martinique and was the mother of six children. My grandmother was blind, my grandfather dead, and my father had been in China for the last two years, I have no idea why he had gone there. My youthful aunts were always promising to come to see me, but rarely kept their word. My nurse held from Brittany and lived near Comperne, in a little wine house with a low attached hoof, on which wild, guillible hours grew, that was the first flower which tom my eyes as a child, and I have loved it ever since. Its leaves are heavy and sad looking, and its petals are made of the setting sun. Brittany is a long way off, even in our present type of velocity of travel. In those days it was the end of the world. Fortunately, my nurse falls in a pier as a good kind woman, and as her own child had died, she had only means love. But she loved me after the man of poor people, when she had time. One day, as her husband was ill, she went into the field to help gather impothators. The other damp soil was rotting them, and there was no time to be lost. She left me in charge of her husband, who was lying on his bread on bed, suffering from a bad attack of Lumbagor. The good woman had placed me in my heart, and had been careful to put in the wooden peg which supported the narrow tray for my toys. She threw a fogot in the grate, and said to me in bright and language, until the age of four I only had the soil prepped on. If you could go help me, blossom. That was my only name at the time. When she had gone, I tried to withdraw the wooden peg, which she had taken so much trouble to put in place. Finally I succeeded in pushing aside the little rampart. I wanted to reach the ground, but poor little me, I fell into the fire which was burning joyfully. The screams of my foster father, who could not move, brought in some neighbors, I was thrown all smoking into large pale of fresh milk. My aunts were informed of what had happened. They communicated the news to my mother, and for the next four days that quiet part of the country was plowed by stage coaches that arrived in rapid succession. My aunts came from all parts of the world, and my mother, in the greatest alarm, has been from Brussels with Balonlade, one of her friends, who was a young doctor just beginning to acquire celebrity, and the house surgeon whom Balonlade had brought with him. I have been told since that nothing was more pain through to witness and yet so charming, as my mother's despair, the doctor approved of the mask of butter, which was changed every two hours. Deer, by own Lade, I often saw him afterwards, and now, and again, we shall meet him in the pages of my memoirs. He used to tell me in such charming fashion how those kind, full, clothed milk blossom, and he could never refrain from laughing at the thought of that butter. There was butter everywhere he used to say, on the bedstead, on the cupboard, on the chairs on the tables, hanging on maize in bladders, all the neighbours used to bring butter to make masks for milk blossom. Mother, admirer, bebrewed, he felt looked like a Madonna with her golden hair and her eyes frined to with such long lashes that they made a shadow on her cheeks when she lowered her eyes. She distributed money on all sides. She would have given her golden hair, his lender wide fingers, her tiny feet, had life itself in order to say for child. As she was us sincere in her despair and her love, as in her unconscious for getfulness, barondlade with her to Paris, living my mother on fozine and the surgeon with me. For two days later, mother took the nurse, the foster father and me, back in triumph to Paris, and distraught us in a little house at Naï, all the bags of the sainer. I had not even a scar it appears, my skin was rather to bright a pink, but that was all. My mother had been transfer once more, began to travel again, leaving me in care of my own. To years were spent in the little garden at Naï, which was full of horrible dahlias, growing close together and colored like wooden balls. My aunts never came there. My mother used to send money, boom, and toys. The foster father died and my nurse married a concierge, we used to open the door at 65 through the provosts. Not knowing where to find my mother and not being able to write. My nurse, without telling any of my friends, took me with her to her new abode. The change delighted me. I was five years old at the time, and I remember the day as if it were yesterday. My nurse's abode was just over the doorway of the house, and the window was framed in the heavy and monumental door. From outside I thought it was beautiful, and I began to clap my hands on reaching the house. It was towards five o'clock in the evening in the month of November when everything looks gray. I was put to bed and not out. I went to sleep at once for there and my recollection of that day. The next morning there was terrible grief in store for me. There was no window in the little grooming which I slept, and I began to cry and escaped from the arms of my nurse who was dressing me so that I could go into the adjoining room. I ran to the round window which was an immense bullseye above the doorway. I pressed my stubborn brow against the glass and began to scream with rage and seen no trees. No boxwood, no leaves falling, nothing, nothing but stone, corn, gray, aglyston, and pains of glass opposite me. I want to go away, has creamed. I don't want to stay here. It's all black, black, it is ugly. I want to see the ceiling of the street and I burst into tears. My poor nurse took me up in her arms and folded me in a rug to put me down into the courtyard. Lift your head, make glass some and look. See, there is the ceiling on the street. It comforted me somewhat to see that there was some sky in this ugly place, but my little soul was very sad. I could not eat and I could pay him and became anemic and they should certainly have died of consumption if it had not been for a mere chance and most unexpected incident. One day I was playing in the courtyard with a little girl named Teteen who lived on the second floor and whose face or real name I cannot recall. When I saw my nurse his husband walking across the courtyard with two ladies, one of whom was most fashionably attired. I could only see their backs, but the voice of the fashionably attired lady caused my heart to stop beating. My poor little body trembled with nervous excitement. Do any of the windows welcome to the courtyard she asked. Yes, my down, those four, he replied, pointing to four open ones on the first floor. The lady turned to look at them and I uttered a cry of joy. At through seeing Aunt Rosine, I explained, clinging to the skirts of the pretty visitor. I buried my face in her first, stamping, sobbing, laughing and tearing her wide lace sleeves in my friends of delight. She took me in her arms and tried to calm me and questioning the concert, she stumbled out to her friend. They can't understand what the film means. This is little sawa, my sister used this child. The noise I made had attracted attention and people opened their windows. My aunt decided to take refuge in the concerto's lodge in order to come to an explanation. My poor nurse told her about all that had taken place and her husband's death and their second marriage. I do not remember what she said to excuse herself. I clung to my aunt who was deliciously perfumed and they would not let her go. She promised to come the following day to fetch me, but I did not want to say any longer in that dark place. I asked to start at once with my nurse. My aunt stroked my hair gently and spoke to her friend in a language I did not understand. She tried in vain to explain something to me. I do not know what it was, but I insisted that they wanted to go away with her at once. In a gentle tender caressing voice, but without an real affection, she said all kinds of pretty things stroked me with her globbed hands, but at my fraught which was their nap made any amount of charming, free-willed sleet of gestures, but all without any real feeling. She then went away at her friends and treaty after emptying her purse in my nurse's hands. I rushed toward the door, but has banned of my nurse who had opened it for her. Now close it again. My nurse was crying and taking me in her arms. She opened the window saying to me, don't cry me of blossom. Look at your pretty aunt. She will come back again and then you can go away with her. Great years fall down her calm, round hands some face. I could see nothing but the dark, black hole which remained very mutable behind me. And in a fit of this pair I rushed out to my aunt who was just getting into a carriage. After that I knew nothing more, everything seemed dark. There was a noise in the distance. I could hear voices far away. I had managed to escape from my pool nurse and had fallen down on the pavement in front of my aunt. I had broken my arm into places and injured my left kneecap. I only came to myself again a few hours later to find that I was in a beautiful wide bed which smelled very nice. It stood in the middle of a large room with two lovely windows which made me very joyful, where I could see the ceiling of the street through them. My mother who had been sent for immediately came to take care of me and I saw the rest of my family, my aunts and my cousins. My poor little brain could not understand why all these people should suddenly be so fond of me when I had passed so many days and nights only cared for by a one single person. As I was weekly and my bones was small and friable, I was two years recovering from this terrible fall and during that time was nearly always carried them out. I would pass over these two years of my life which have left me only with a vague memory of being patented and of a chronic state of topo. One day my mother took me on her knees and said to me, there are big girl now and you must learn to read and write. I was seven years old and could neither read, write, no count as I had been five years with your nurse and two years ill. He must go to school, continue to my mother, playing with my curly hair, like a big girl. I did not know what all this meant and I asked what a school was. It's a place where there are many little girls who apply my mother. Are they ill? I asked, oh no, they're quite well as you are now and they play together and they're very gay and happy. I jumped about in delight and gave free wind to my joy but on seeing tears in my mother's eyes I flung myself in her arms. But what about you, mama? I asked, you will be all alone and you won't have any little girl. She bent down to me and said, girl does told me that he will suddenly some flowers and a little baby. My delight was more and more boisterous than I shall have a little brother, I explained, or else a little sister, oh no, I don't want that, I don't like little sisters. Mama gives me very affectionately and then I was dressed, I remember, in a blue-coated velvet frog of which I was very proud. I read, that has been almost blended, I waited impatiently for unforeseen courage which was to take us to a tae. It was about three when she arrived, the housemate had gone on about an hour before and I had watched with delight, my little trunk and my dors being packed into the carriage. The maid climbed up and took the seat by the driver in spite of my mother protesting at first against this. When my aunts McNeficent type of hunter arrived, Mama was the first to get in, slowly and calmly, a golden slowly too, giving myself airs because the concierge and some of the shopkeepers were watching. My aunts then sprung in lightly but by no means calmly, after giving her orders in English to the safe ridiculous looking coachman and handing her a paper on which the address was written. Another carriage followed the hours in which three men were seated, Reggie L, a friend of my father's, General DePipp and the artist named Flairi, I think, whose pictures of horses and sporting subjects were very much involved just then. I heard on the way that these gentlemen were going to arrange about a little dinner in New York Day to console Mama for her great travel in being separated from me, some other guests were to be there to meet them. I did not pay very much attention to what my mother and my aunts said to each other, sometimes when they spoke of me they talked either English of German as well that mean affectionately. The long drive was greatly appreciated, bunny, for with my face pressed against the window and my eyes wide open, I gazed out eagerly at the grey muddy road with its ugly houses on each side and its bare trees, I thought it was all very beautiful because it kept changing. The carriage stopped at 18 blue well-o-hot-a, and the iron gate was a long dark signboard with gold letters. I looked up at it and Mama said, you will be able to read that soon, I hope. My aunt whispered to me, boarding school, Madam Fressa, and very promptly I said to Mama, it says boarding school, Madam Fressa, Mama, my aunt and the three gentlemen laughed hardly at my assurance and we entered the house. Madam Fressa came forward to meet us and the luck tear at once. She was of medium height rather stout with us more waste and her hair turning grey on sevignet. She had beautiful large eyes rather like dorsh sons, very white teeth, which showed up all the more as her complexion was rather dony. She looked healthy, spoke cancly, her hands were plump and her fingers long. She took my hand gently in her eyes and half kneeling so that her face was leveled with mine. She said in a musical voice, you won't be afraid of me, will you little girl? I did not answer, but my face flushed as red as a cops come. She asked me several questions but I refused to reply. They all gathered round me. Speak child, comes a rabia good girl, or they not eat little child. It was holding vein, I remained perfectly mute. The customer around was then made to the bedrooms, the dining hall, the classrooms, and the usual exaggerated compliments were paid. How beautiful it is all kept, howspotlessly clean everything is, and the hundreds deputies of this kind about the comfort of these prisons for children. My mother went to hide with Madam for sale and I clung to her knees so that she could not walk. This is the doctor's prescription, she said, and then followed along list of things that were to be done to me. Madam for sale smiled, rather ironically, you know, Madam, she said to my mother, we shall not be able to curl her hair like that. And you certainly will not be able to encourage it to apply my mother stroking my head with her blood hands. It's a regular wig and they must never attend to commit until it had been well-brushed, they could not possibly get the knots out otherwise and they would hair tear too much. Would we give children at four o'clock she asked changing this object? Oh, a slice of bread and just what the parents leave for them. There are 12 parts of different kinds of jam, said my mother, but she must have jam one day and chocolate another as she has not a good appetite and why it's changed a food. I have brought six pounds of chocolate. Madam for sale smiled in a good natured but rather ironically, she picked that packet of the chocolate and looked at the mark. Ah, from that key, what I spoiled with it, I'd go only this, she padded my cheek with her wide fingers and then as her eyes fell on the large jar she looked surprised. Her skull creamed, said my mother, I make it myself and they should like my little girl's face and hands to be rubbed with it every night when she goes to bed, but beyond Madam for sale, oh, I'll pay double laundry expenses for the sheets interrupted my mother impatiently. Ah, my poor mother, I remember quite well that my sheets were changed once a month, like those of the other pupils. The farewell moment came at last and everyone gathered around Mamma and finally carried her off after a great deal of kissing and with all kinds of consoling words, it will be good, it will be so good for her, it is just what she needs, you find her quite changed when you see her again, etc. The general who was very fond of me, picked me up in his arms and taught me in the air, you little kid he said, they are putting you to the barracks and you will have to mine your base, I pulled his long stash and he said, winking and looking into the direction of Madam for sale, who had a slight stash, you mustn't do that to a lady, you know, my aunt left hardly and my mother gave a little stifled laugh and the whole group went off in a regular will-wind of russian skirts and farewells while I was taken away to a cage where I was being imprisoned. I spent two years at the ponceo, I was taught reading, writing and reckoning, I also learned a hundred new games, I learned to sing rundos and to embroider hand kitchens for my mother, I was relatively happy there as we always went out somewhere on Thursdays and Sundays and this gave me the sensation of liberty, the very ground in the street seemed to me quite different from the ground of the large garden belonging to the pension, besides there were little festivities at Madam for sale which used to send me into ruptures, Madam's telakula who had just made her debut a detailed references, came sometimes on Thursdays and recited poetry to us. I could never sleep awake the night before and in the morning I used to come my hair carefully and get ready and I had beat in fast with excitement. In order to listen to something I did not understand at all but which nevertheless left me spellbound. Then too there was quite a legend that touched to these pretty girl, she had flank herself almost under the horse's feet as the emperor was driving along, noted what tracked his attention and obtained the pardon of her brother who had conspired against his so-rient. Madam was also telakula had a sister at Madam for sard's and this sister, kratilid, is now the wife of Nistopiae Malong and the secretary of state in the treasury department. Stila was slight and fair with blue eyes that were rather hard but expressive. She had a deep voice and when this pain Fradjaa girl began to recite Adhali's dream with thrilled me through and through. How many times seated on my child's bed did I practice saying in a low voice, from blue, fear, ding, near the wall? I used to twist my head in my shoulders, swell out my cheeks and comments, drumble, drumble, drumble, drumble, but it always ended badly and I would begin again very quietly in a stifled voice and then unconsciously speak louder and my companions browsed by the noise, where I knew that my attendants and rode with laughter. I would then rush about to the ride and left, giving them cakes and blows which they returned with interest. Madam resorts a lot the daughter, Malong was al-Qadoline, whom I chance to meet a long time after married to the celebrated artist he won, would then appear on the scene angry and impackable and would give us all kinds of punishments for the following day. As for me, I used to get locked up for three days that was followed by my being detained on the first day we were allowed out and in addition I would receive five strokes with a ruler on my fingers. Those ruler blows of Madam Azal Karoline's I reproach her about them when I met her again 25 years later. She used to make as put all our fingers round the thumb and hold our hands out straight into her and then bound came her wide, I have on ruler. She used to give us a clearly heart, dry blow which made the tears perched through our eyes. I took at this light to Madam Azal Karoline. She was beautiful but with a kind of beauty I did not care for. She had a very wide complexion and very black hair which he wore in weight pandos. When I saw her a long time afterwards one of my relatives brought her to my house and said, I am sure you will not recognize this lady and yet you know her very well. I was leaning against the large mantopies in the hole and I saw these tall woman so beautiful but rather provincial looking coming through the first drawing room. As she descended the three steps into the hole the light fell on her protruding forehead framed on each side with a hard weight bundle. But once I had carefully now explained and with a ferventive childish movement I hit my two hands behind my back. I never saw her again who the garage I had old hair on my childhood must have been apparent under my politeness as all this. As I said before I was not unhappy at Madam for salt and it seemed quite natural to me that I should stay there until I was quite grown up. My uncle Felix Fulho who at present has entered the Carthusian monastery had stipulated that his wife, my mother's sister, should often take me out. He had a very fine country place at the year with a stream running through the grounds and I used to fish there for hours together with my two cousins, a boy and a girl. These two years of my life passed peacefully without any other vents done my terrible feats of temper which upset the whole pension and always left me in the sick room for two or three days. These outbursts of temper were like attacks of madness. One day on<|translate|> Ruzine arrived suddenly to take me away all together. My father had pre-tone given orders as to where I was to be placed out. This morning as well. He protected my mother. He disوا her very careful, so she eventually helped him and Madame Frissar for not finding some way to keep me with her. The struggle lasted two hours, and Mila was being dressed, I escaped twice into the garden, and attempted to climb the trees and to throw myself into the pond in which there was more mud than water. Finally, when I was completely exhausted and subdued, I was taken off, sobbing into my aunt's carriage. I said three days at her house, as I was so furious that my life was said to be in danger. My father used to come to the house of my aunt Frissine, who was then living at six free-delish or sedan ten. He was of friendly terms with Frissini, who lived at number four in the same street. He often brought him in, and Rossini made me laugh with his clever stories and coming premises. My father was as handsome as a god, and I used to look at him with pride. I did not know him well, as I so him so rarely, but I loved him for his seductive voice, and his slow gentle gestures. He commanded a certain respect, and they noticed that even my exuberant aunt came down in his presence. I recovered, and Dr. Monon, who was attending me, said that I could now be moved without any fear of ill effects. We had been waiting for my mother, but she was ill at Halem. My aunt offered to accompany us, if my father would take me to the combat, but he refused, and I can hear him now, with his gentle voice saying, no, her mother will take her to the combat. I have written to the forwards, and the child is to stay there for night. My aunt was about to protest, but my father replied, it's quieted there, my dear Rossini, and the child needs tranquility more than anything else. I went that very evening to my aunt's force. I did not care much for her, as she was called and affected, but I adored my uncle. He was a gentle and so calm, and there was an infinite charm in his mind. His son was astubridant, as I was myself, adventures, and rather hair-brained, so that we always liked being together. His sister, an adorable, grossed-like girl, was reserved and dull as afraid of soling her fraughts, and even her peanut-flourous. The poor child married Barron'saries and died during her confinement in the very flower of youth and beauty, because her timidity, her reserve and narrow education, her might her refuse to see a doctor when the intervention of a medical man was absolutely necessary. I was very fond of her, and her death was a great grief to me. At present, I never see the faintest ray of moonlight, without its abocating a pale vision of her. I stayed three weeks at my uncle's, roaming about with my cousin and spending hours lying down flat, fishing for crayfish in the little stream that ran through the park. This park was in men since rounded by a wide fish. How many times I used to have beds with my cousins that they would jump at ditch. The bed was sometimes three sheets of paper or five pins, or perhaps my two pancakes for we used to have pancakes every Tuesday. And after the bed, I jumped more often than not falling into the ditch, as blushing about in the green water, screaming because I was afraid of the frogs, and yelling with terror when my cousin pretended to rush away. When I returned to the house, my aunt was always watching anxiously at the top of the stone steps for our arrival. What a lecture I had and what a cold look. Go upstairs and change your clothes, my father, she would say, and they'll stay in your room. Your dinner will be sent to you there without any dessert. As I passed the big glass in the hall, I would cut aside of myself looking like a rotten police dump, and see my cousin making signs that he would bring me some dessert by putting his hands to his mouth. His sister used to go to his mother, who fumbled her and seemed to say, thank heaven, you are not like that little bohemian. This was my aunt's stinging epithet for me moments of anger. I used to go up to my room with a heavy heart, thoroughly shamed and bext, bowing to myself that I would never again jump to ditch. But on reaching my room, my wood find the gardener storted there, a big awkward mirror girl who used to wait on me. Oh, how comic-ma-ma-zell looks like that, she would say, laughing so hardly that I was proud of looking comic and decided that when I jumped the ditch again, I would get weeds and mud all over me. When I had a breast and washed, I used to the proton a flan and gound, waiting my room until my dinner came. Soup was sent up and then meed, bread and water. I detested meed then just as I do now. And threw it out of the window after cutting off the fat, which I put on the ring of my plate, as my aunt used to come up unexpectedly. Have you eaten your dinner, melt-muzzle, she would ask, yes aunt, I replied, are you still hungry? No aunt, right out, our father and the queen three times, you little heathen. This was because I had not been baptized. According to our later, my uncle would come upstairs. Have you had enough dinner, he would ask, yes uncle, I replied, did you eat your meat? No, I threw it out of the window, I don't like meat, you told you aren't gonna truth them. No, she asked me if I had eaten my dinner and I answered that I had, but I did not say that I had eaten my meat. What punishment has she given you? I am to write out our father and the queen three times before going to bed. Do you know them by heart? No, not very well, I make mistakes all the way. And the adorable man would then dictate to me our father and the queen, and they would copy it in the most about way, as he used to detake with deep feeling and emotion. He was religious, very religious indeed, the son called mine, and after the death of my aunt, he became a curfewsim monk. At the present moment, ill and age as he is, and bent with pain, I know he is digging his own grave, weak with a weight of the spade, imploring God to take him and thinking sometimes of me his little Bohemian. Ah, the dear good man, it is to him that I owe all that is best in me. I love you, the Godly, and have the greatest respect for him. How many times in the difficult phases of my life, I have thought of him and consulted his ideas for I never saw him again, as my aunt quarreled purposely with my mother and me. He was all his fond of me, though, and has told his friends to assure me of this. Occasionally too, he has sent me his advice, which has always been very straightforward and full of intelligence and common sense. Recently, I went to the country where they have two sins, have taken refuge. A friend of mine went to see my uncle, and they wiped him here and the words he had dictated to be repeated to me. To return to my story, after my uncle's visit, Marie, the gardener, stored, came to my room, looking quite indifferent, but with the pocket stuffed with apples, biscuits, raisins and nuts. My cousin had sent me some dessert, but she, the good heart of girl, had cleared all the dessert dishes. I told her to sit down and crack the nuts, and I would eat them when I had finished my Lord's prayer and creed. She sat down on the floor so that she could hide everything quickly under the table in case my aunt returned, but my aunt said them came again, as she and her daughter used to spend their evenings at the piano while my uncle taught his son mathematics. Finally, my mother wrote to say that she was coming. There was great excitement in my uncle's house, and my little trunk was packed in readiness. The grandchild's comment, which I was about to enter, had a prescribed uniform, and my cousin, who loved chewing, marked all my things with initials SP and red cotton. My uncle gave me a silver spoon, fork and goblet, and these were all marked 32, which was the number and the witch I was registered there. Marie gave me a thick, full and muffler in different shades of violet, which she had been knitting for me in suitor the last few days. My aunt put round my neck a little scapularie, which had been blessed, and when my mother and father arrived, everything was ready. A farewell dinner was given, which two of my mother's friends, on cuisine and four other members of the family were invited. I felt very important. I was neither aunt nor gay, but had just this feeling of importance, which was quite enough for me. Everyone at table talked about me. My uncle kept stroking my hair, and my cousin from her end of the table through me kisses. Suddenly my father's musical voice made me turn toward him. Listen to me, Sara, he said. If you are very good at the comment, I will come in four years and fetch you away and you shall travel with me and see some beautiful countries. Oh, I will be good, I explained. I'll be as good as aunt how yet. This was my aunt for everybody's mouth. After dinner, the weather being very fine. We all went out to stroll in the back. My father took me with him and talked to me very seriously. He told me things that were sad, which I had never heard before. I understood although I was so young and my eyes filled with tears. He was sitting on an old bench and I was on his knee with my head resting on his shoulder. I listened to all he said, and cried silently. My child is mind distirped by his words. Poor father. I was never never to see him again.

The Allied forces English and French had been backward day by day until it seemed as if Paris was early within the German's grasp. Bent indeed but never broken and with the turning of the tide the Allied line had rushed forward and France breathed again. Two men seated in a room of the United Service Club in London, one gloomy afternoon in November 1914, talked over the situation in tones too low to reach other ears. The older man, Sir Perseval Hargraves, had been bemoaning the fact that England seemed honeycombed by the German secret service and his nephew John Hargraves and Officer in uniform was attempting to reassure him. It was a farewell meeting for the young officer was returning to the front. Much good will all this espionage do the Germans said the young man, we are easily holding our own and with the spring will probably come our opportunity. He clicked his teeth together, priced then all these suspected plots and futile intrigues. Don't be so damned cocksure wrapped out his uncle, his exasperation showing in heightened color and snapping eyes. It's that same cocksureness which has almost brought the British Empire to the very brink of disillusion. His nephew smiled tolerantly and shifted his thick-set figure to a more comfortable position. Now now he caution, remember what old saw bones told you yesterday about not exciting yourself. Said you weren't to read or talk about this belly-old war, leave the worrying to Kitchener. He'll see we chaps do our part. If everything were left to Kitchener, Sir Perseval thumped the arm of his chair, some of us would sleep easier in our beds and I know you chaps at the front will do your part. What to God I could be with you glancing at his shrunken and useless left leg? If I could only take a pot at the beggars. According to your belief, the firing line will shortly be on English soil, chafed his nephew, avoiding looking at his companion. He knew the tragic circumstances surrounding his uncle's maimed condition and wished to avoid anything touching upon sentiment. If the plans to undermine England's home government are perfected and carried out, every man, woman and child will have to band together to repel invasion. Sir Perseval lowered his voice. If there are any able body men left here, don't be so pessimistic. Kirchner has built up a great army and is only waiting the proper moment to launch it in the field. The best of England has volunteered to agree to Sir Perseval, but what about the slackers? What about the coal strikes? The trouble in our munition factories, all are chargeable to the Kaiser's war machine which overlooks nothing in its complete preparedness. England doesn't yet know the meaning of the word. It's time for me to leave. Said the young officer consulting his watch. Take my word for it, uncle. We're not going to the diminishing bow-outs. Count on England's bulldog grit. God help Germany when the allies get into that country. When, ah, when, echoed Sir Perseval, I hope that I live to see the day. Tell me, boy, his voice softened. How is it with you and Molly? His nephew readened under his tan. Molly doesn't care for a chap like me, he muttered. Did she tell you so? Well, no, you see, uncle. It doesn't seem the thing to suggest that a charming girl like Molly tie herself to a fellow who may get his at any time. Piffle, Sir Perseval's shaggy eyebrows met in a frown, sentimental nonsense. You and Molly were great chums a year ago. You told me yourself that you hoped to marry her. I even spoke to her mother about the suitability of the match. You had no right to blazed his nephew. It was damned important interference. You have not always thought so, retorted Sir Perseval bitterly. What had that most important American girl you met in Germany to do with your change of front toward Molly? I must insist that you speak more respectfully of Kathleen, John Hargraves, expression altered. If you must know, I asked Kathleen to marry me and she refused. I said she was important. All Americans are. They don't know any better, fumed his uncle. Forget her, John. Think of Molly. I tell you the child loves you. Don't record happiness for the sake of a fleeting fancy. fleeting fancy, John Hargraves shook his head soarfully. When Kathleen refused me, I was hard hit. So hit, I can't marry any other girl. Don't let's talk of it. He smiled wistfully as he held out his hand. Times up uncle, the train leaves in an hour, and I must get my kit. Goodbye, Sir. Wish me luck. And before the older man could stop him, he was retreating down the hall. Sir Perseval stared vagantly about the room. The last of his race he muttered, God helping Lend the toll is heavy. In spite of his haste, John Hargraves was late in reaching Victoria Station and had barely time to take his place before the train pulled slowly out. As he looked down the long train shed, he encountered the fixed stare of a tall well-grumed man standing near one of the pillars. Hargraves looked and looked again, then his hand flew up and leaning far out of his compartment, he shouted to a porter. But his message was lost in the roar of the more rapidly moving train, and the porter shaking a bewildered head turned back. The crowd of women and children and a few men which had gathered to witness the troop trains departure was silently dispersing when an obsequious porter approached the tall stranger whose appearance had so excited John Hargraves. He kept out air, sir. He said, this was why, sir. And as the stranger made no move to follow him, he leaned forward and lifted the latter's top coat from his arm. Let me carry this air for you, Governor. Then, in a whisper that none could over here, he said, in German, boy, a lie, phallamay. Go on, directed the stranger in English, pausing to adjust his crevat and made his leisurely way after the hurling porter. The latter stopped finally by the side of a somewhat battered looking limousine. Here he are, sir. Announced the porter, not waiting for the chauffeur to pull open the door. I most amissed you, he rattled on, caught the cabset and tucked your boxes inside. Then I looked for you at the booking office, according to directions, let me tuck this air lap robe, or yeah. As the stranger stepped into the limousine and seated himself, the porter clambered in after him. There on, he whispered his freckleshowing plainly against his white face. This shall first one of us, he'll take you straight to our landing. This back hurts for you. Good luck. And pocketing at the sovereign offered, the porter voicing loud thanks backed from the limousine and slammed the door shut. The outskirts of London were reached before the man in the limousine, opened the slip of paper thrust into his hand by the porter. It was wrapped about a small electric torch and a book of cigarette papers, slowly he read the German script in the note. Be it the rendezvous by Thursday, Hans the chauffeur has full directions, do not miss the 17th. After rereading the contents of the note, the man tore it into tiny bits and not content with that, stuffed them among the tobacco in his pipe. Striking a match, he lighted his pipe, and planted his feet on the bag, he gazed long and earnestly at his initials stamp on the much labeled buckskin. The slowing up of the limousine aroused him from his meditations, and he glanced out of the window to see which way they were headed. London, the metropolis of the civilized world, lay behind him, catching his chauffeur's backward glance, he signaled him to continue onward as removing his pipe, he muttered, gotthrava England, and a chapter one.","Detective Fiction, War & Military Fiction",English,06:39:45,James R.

The Adventure of the Broad Arrow and Australian Romance by morally robberts. New Find. It's possible to be damned without being dead, said Smith, as he drank his noblur at the Pilbara Hotel. And minors are the men who know it in such a place as this. He looked out of the wreaking bar room on the light brown glare of waterless desert with a few thirsty trees scattered over it. We're in the pit, so to speak he continued, but not the lowest, for there are drinks here still. Warm up again, Bob, and have one yourself. As for me, I feel like it blew my skin and shirt for a last one before I tumble to pieces and rot finger by finger in this hole. The men in the bar stood in drink with him silently. Yet, one who was mad drunk with brandy and sunlight smashed his tumbler on the bar top, and pitched the bottom at a mongrel dog slinking outside in the thin shadow. Where's the best news, Smith? As Bob, who was the only cheerful man in the crowd, the best news answered Smith, is that we are back, and the water's nearly done here, and the rain is not coming, and the camp is rotting. Tin meats and fever water are doing for us. A might as well have stayed out younger and got sun-dried and mulled and spinoffed. He went off foolishly into the blazing sun, which came down at a slam of 90 degrees, and shone back from the hot dust with a glare that could blister a man under his chin. The town that he strode through was a board's and canvas and corrugated iron. It's stink in the still air, and, as man, or horse, or camel went by, the dust rose thick, and empty cans rang. But into the stagnant desolation came men perpetually. They came in with gold fever and went out with typhoid, and still their empty places filled up. The western Australian paper screamed no water, and the eastern papers copied them with jealous additions, but men came in to drink thick mud and raw, like silly sheep piled against the winward fence in a dry season, when the creeks and tanks are dry and grasses not. From Albany, Perth, and Fring mantle, from Kimberly, Merchison, and Cool Guardian, men rushed in till new find, so greatly boomed, with full of good men and thieves of workers and loafers of white men and of China men, and they were all bent on gold to the fever got them, and the yelled under canvas, which was a no shelter from the sun. But ants and spiders and scorpions glowy, while men died, and the flies were thick on sick men's mouths, and onerless dogs dug up corpses and died of blood poisoning. For the ways of men under ancient stresses, are as that ways of ancient instinct, in inevitable, in unalterable channels. They drift where gold is, or where the thought of its possibility lies, they marched like locus into a ditch, which is death. They pour out of the towns like ants from a disturbed ant hill, they try the absurd, and storm the impossible, they raw and stick in the mire, they perish, and are known no more, they will, wither like grass, and are of no avail. Yet each individual man is even there the center of his world, and thinks that he will do this and do that, and each day he does what the dead day wills. And the night subscribe to, but does no more and does no other, and such as these was Smith, who braved some death in a bitter sun, as he walked through the hideous town to his mates' hut out west on the plain. As he went out of the sunlight into shadow, which was thick darkness after the glare of the new day light, he stumbled across someone. Where the devil are you, treading, growled the sun-nullant man he had disturbed, can't see after being in the sun, said Smith, is that you, Tom? Yes, Tom, the water-carter, whose job looked like giving out. For water now was bought by Richmond, in measured buckets, and by poor ones, in mean, tin, panicons. You mean you can't see after soaking in whiskey at the pel barra, don't you? He added, a little boat said Smith, lying down on a pile of dirty guinea sacks, I've been out facing the earth destroyer and the dryer up of water, and I wanted to get blind. Why are you back at the cast-on? I came in and saw the baker yonder, and I found hicks too, so I just lay down. You had a bad time? The men he spoke of were at the far end of the hut, one was in an old bushbed made of steaks and sticks, and stretched sacking, while the other sat at the table, unscraped grease from it with a glass knife. We funked it, said Smith, there's no other word for it. Oh, blazes, I can't lie still. He rose and went to the table and sat opposite to hicks. Reaching over, he borrowed the other man's knife without ceremony, and scratched his name in big capital letters in the wood. When he had finished Smith, he jabbed the knife into the eye of his name, and went on talking. We got sixty miles out across the sand, a moga, and the porcupine grass. Yes, sixty miles into the desert, and we saw its red rim dance, and its scrub crackle, and the water bags looked mean bedding against the sun. So we put our tails between our legs and crawled back sick, and ready to rock here, but when the rain comes, where there, where there? Why didn't you take camels as Tom? Smith smiled. Why didn't we organize an expedition? Camels and Atkins cost money, and I don't like their ways. Courses are good enough for me. You wait till the rain comes, but another chip into the talk. It'll never rain no more so the man lay on the bed. I'm going home to my mom, and I'll live where there's water, and make love to the apocryan a week's slavy, and be it tough in a back street. What did I come out here for? That's better to be a sneak, and be jubbed and lundered than the ear if they did anything, and so bad, the long timers, as making come to such a place as this ear, they'd have a valley agitation in England, and a meaten in the park. Why, up you cockney baker, you said, Smith, more good humor to you than he and yet spoken. It's never home, you'll get, you and I will fill a sand pit here, and I'll dig yours. We'll scrape it out with a broken bottle, and a carousine tin, and we'll write your name on the height of your dead dog, and plan them with you to keep you faithful company. But the cockney took it all in a good park, and only pretended to weep at his mates' brutal suggestions. Boo-hoo-hoo said he, that I should ever be mates with a man whose name is Smith, when mine is mom the bill, and that you stole with your passage money said, Hicks, who had not spoken yet, but now he angered man the bill, who suggested forcibly in the very choices all strung, that if he didn't dry up, he would soon put the kabash on him. But hits laughed, as he was six feet foreign high, and the five stone the heavier man, he could afford to let the cockney say, would he please? And mom the bill said it till Smith interfered. Now then, leave each other alone. It's not you that's quarrelin, it's the sun, moon, and stars, the wind, and sand, and whether you've got a fight with. Get out and claw the sand, man. Arrah-rah, go it, dear boys against the devil, who is the painter's seat of Pilbara? He lied it his pipe and smoke, and there was silence for a space in that sweet heaven.

When he saw something was wrong, he tried to correct it. Then one day he saw it hanging in the town square. The hanging stranger, by Philip K. Dick. Five o'clock. Ed loised washed up, tossed on his hat and coat. God is car out and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His back and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and wheelling it into the backyard. But for a 40-year-old man he had done okay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved. And he liked the idea of repairing the foundations himself. It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurry and commuters. Tired and grim-faced women loaded down with bundles and packages. Students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks and businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his packered for a red light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him. He'd arrived just in time to spell a help for dinner. Go over the records of the day. Maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. There were no parking spaces in front of, loised TV sales and service. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a euteron. Again he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamp post. From the lamp post something was hanging. As shapeless dark bundle swinging a little with the wind, like a dummy of some sort. Loised rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the chamber of commerce put up displays in the square. Again he made a euteron and brought the car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display, it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed un-easily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands. It was a body, a human body. Look at it, loised snapped. Come on out here. Don Ferguson came slowly out of the store, butning his pin-striped coat with dignity. This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there. See it? Ed pointed at the gathering gloom. The lamp post jetted up against the sky. The post and the bundle swinging from it. There it is. How the hell long has that been there? His voice rose excitedly. What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past. Don Ferguson, with a cigarette. Take it easy old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there. A reason? What kind of reason? Ferguson's shrug. Like the time the traffic safety council put the wrecked view at there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know? Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. Why, sir, boys? There's a body hanging from the lamp post. Loised said, I'm gonna call the cops. They must know about it, Potter said, or otherwise it wouldn't be there. I've got to get back in. Ferguson headed back into the store. Business before pleasure. Loised began to get hysterical. You see it? You see it hanging there? A man's body. A dead man. Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee. You mean it's been there all afternoon? Sure. What's the matter? Potter glanced at his watch. Have to run. See you later, Ed. Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Man and women passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundle. And then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention. I'm going nuts, Loised whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic among the cars. Horne's honked angrily at him. He gained the curb and stepped up into the little square of green. The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped in torn. A gray suit splashed and caked with dry mud. A stranger. Loised had never seen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned away. And in the evening wind, he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes. Deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel rim glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His eye is bulged. His mouth was open. Tong thick and ugly blue. For heaven's sake, Loised muttered second. He pushed down his nausea and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over with revulsion and fear. Why? Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean? And why didn't anybody notice? He bumped into a small man hurring along the sidewalk. Watch it, the man grated. Oh, it's you, Ed. Ed nodded, dazily. Hello, Jenkins. What's the matter? The stationary clerk caught Ed's arm. You look sick. The body therein the park. Sure, Ed. Jenkins led him to the alcove of Loised TV sales in service. Take it easy. Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store, join them. Something going on? Ed's not feeling well. Loised, yank himself free. How can you stand there? Don't you see it? For God's sake. What's he talking about? Margaret asked nervously. The body, Ed shouted. The body hanging there. More people collected. Is he sick? It's Ed Loised. You okay, Ed? The body, Loised screams. Struggling to get past them? Hands caught at him. He tore loose. Let me go. The police. Get the police. Ed. Better get a doctor. He must be sick or drunk. Loised fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell. Through a blur he saw two rows of faces. Curious, concerned, anxious. Man and women, halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward his store. He could see Ferguson inside, talking to a man, showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley was in the back at the service counter, setting up a new Philco. Loised shouted at them frantically. His voice was lost in the roar of traffic, and the murmur around him. Do something he's creamed. Don't stand there. Do something. Something's wrong. Something's happened. Things are going on. The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy set cops moving efficiently toward Loised. Name. The cop with the notebook murmured. Loised, he mopped his forehead weirdly. Edward C. Loised. Listen to me. Back there. Address. The cop demanded. The police car moves swiftly through traffic, shooting among the cars and bushes. Loised sagged against the seat, exhausted, and confused. He took a deep, shuttered breath. 1368 Hearst Road. That's here in Pikeville. That's right. Loised pulled himself up with a violent effort. Listen to me. Back there in the square, hanging from the lamp post. Where were you today? The cop behind the wheel demanded. Where? Loised, echoed? You were in your shop. Were you? No. He shook his head. No, I was home. Down at the basement. In the basement. Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour the cement frame. Why? What has that got to do with? Was anybody else down there with you? No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school. Loised look from the one heavy set cop to the other. Hope. Lickered across his face. Wild hope. You mean, because I was down there, I missed the explanation. I didn't get in on it. Like everybody else? After a pause, the cop with the notebook said, That's right. You missed the explanation. Then it's official. The body. It's supposed to be hanging there? It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see. And Loised, grand weekly. Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep end. I thought maybe something had happened. You know something like the Ku Klux Klian. Some kind of violence communist surface just taking over. He wiped his face with his breast pocket hegarchiff. His hand shaking. I'm glad to know it's on the level. It's on the level. The police car was getting near the hall of justice. The son had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. Loised had not yet come on. I feel better, Loised said. I was pretty excited back there for a minute. I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to take me in, is there? The two cops said nothing. I should be back in my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all right now. No more trouble. Is there any need of this won't take long. The cop behind the wheel interrupted? A short process. Only a few minutes. I hope it short. Voice muttered. The car slowed down for a stoplight. I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny getting excited like that. And Loised yanked open the door. He sprang out into the street and rolled to his feet. The cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as a light changed. Loised left under the curb and raced among the people, burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts, people running. They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in Pikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operated business in a small town for 25 years without getting to know all the cops. They weren't cops. And there hadn't been any explanation. Potter, Ferguson, Jenkins. None of them knew why it was there. They didn't know and they didn't care. That was the strange part. Loised ducked into the hardware store. He raced toward the back, passed the startled clerks and customers into the shipping room and through the back door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete steps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side, gasping and panting. There was no sound behind him. He had got away. He was at the entrance to an alley, dark and strung with boards and ruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end, a streetlight wavered and came on. Man and women, stores, neon signs, cars. And to his right, the police station. He was close, terribly close. Passed the loading platform of the grocery store, rose the white concrete side of the hall of justice. Barred windows, the police antenna, a great concrete wall rising up in the darkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to keep moving, get further away from them. Them? Loised moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the city hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass and broad cement steps. He could see the endless rose of offices, dark windows, the cedars and the beds of flowers on each side of the entrance. And something else. Above the city hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night. A prism, a black that spread out and was lost into the sky. He listened. Good, God, he could hear something. Something that made him struggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound. A buzzing, a distant, muted hum, like a great swarm of bees. Loised gazed up, rigid with terror. The splotch of darkness hanging over the city hall. Darkness so thick that it seemed almost solid. In the vortex, something moved, flickering shapes. Things descending from the sky, pausing momentarily above the city hall, fluttering over it in a dense swarm, then dropping silently onto the roof. Shapes, fluttering shapes from the sky, from the crack of darkness that hung above him. He was seeing them. For a long moment, loised watched, crouching behind a second fence in a pool of scummy water. They had landed, coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the city hall, and disappearing inside. They had wings, like giant insects of some kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest, and then crawled, crab-like, sideways across the roof, and into the building. He was sick and fascinated. Cole, night wind blew around him, and he shuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the city hall, where men standing here and there, groups of men coming out of the building, halting for a moment, then going on. Were there more of them? It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm, were men, they were alien, from some other world, some other dimension. Slighting through this slit, this break in the shell of the universe. Antwering through this gap, winged insects from another realm of being. On the steps of the city hall, a group of men broke up. A few moved toward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter the city hall. It changed its mind, and turned to follow the others. Loise closed his eyes in horror, his senses reeled, he hung on tight, clutching the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shaped, had abruptly flooded up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk, and came to rest among them. Sudo-man, imitation men. Insects with the ability to disguise themselves as men. Like other insects familiar to earth. Protective coloration. Mimacri. Loise pulled himself away, he got slowly to his feet. It was night, the alley was totally dark, but maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe darkness made no difference to them. He left the alley cautiously, and moved out into the street. Man and women flowed past, but not so many now. At the bus stops, stood waiting groups. A huge bus lumbered along the street. It's light flashing in the evening loom. Loise moved forward, he pushed his way among those waiting, and when the bus halted, he boarded it, and took a seat in the rear by the door. A moment later, the bus moved into life, and rumble down the street. Loise relaxed a little. He studied the people around him. Dulled, tired faces. People going home for work. Quite ordinary faces. None of them paid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats. Jiggling with the motion of the bus. The man sitting next to him unfolded in his paper. He began to read the sports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man, blue suit, tie, a businessman, or a salesman, on his way home to his wife and family. Across the aisle, a young woman, perhaps 20, dark eyes and hair, a package on her lap. Nailons and heels. Red, coat, and white, and gourous sweater. Gazing absolutely ahead of her. A high school boy in jeans and black jacket. A great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with packages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness. Ordinary people. The guy in that rode the bus every evening. Going home to their families to dinner. Going home with their minds dead. Control. Filmed over with the mask of an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them. Their town, their lives. His self too, except that he happened to be deep in his cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked. They had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect. Fulproof. Maybe there were others. Hope flickered in a voice. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a mistake. Not got control of him. Their net. Their field of control had passed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down. Apparently, their powers-owned was limited. A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loise broke off his chain of thought. A slender man with dark hair and small massage. Welldressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small hands. He was watching Loise, studying him intently. He turned quickly away. Loise tensed. One of them? Or another they had missed. The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes alive and clever. Shrewd. A man too shrewd for them. Or one of the things itself. An alien insect from beyond. The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into the box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loise. The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second, something passed between them. A look. Rich with meaning. Loise got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step down into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber door swung open. Hey! The driver shouted. Jamming the brakes. What the hell? Loise squirm through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A residential district. Loise and tall apartment buildings. Behind him, the bright eyed man had leapt up. The elderly man was also on his feet. They were coming after him. Loise leapt. He hit the pavement with the terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain leapt over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid down again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off. Loise gropped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock lying in the gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed before him. A man. The bright eyed man with the book. Loise kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loise brought the rock down. The man screamed and tried to roll away. Saap. For God's sake listen. He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and dissolved in a bubbling whale. Loise scrambled up and back. The others were there all around him. He ran awkwardly down the sidewalk. Up the driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were bending over the inert body of the man with the book. The bright eyed man who had come after him. Had he made a mistake. But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out away from them. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between their world and his. Ed? Janet Loise backed away nervously. What is it? What? Ed slammed the door behind him and came into the living room. Pull down the shades. Quick. Janet moved toward the window. But do as I say. Who else is here besides you? Nobody, just the twins, their upstairs in their room. What's happened? You look so strange. Why are you home? Ed locked the front door. He prowled around the house into the kitchen. From the drawer under the sink, he slid out the big butcher knife and ran his finger along it. Sharp. Pluddy sharp. He returned to the living room. Listen to me, he said, I don't have much time. They know I escaped and they'll be looking for me. Escape. Janet's face twisted with bewilderment and fear. Who? The town has been taken over. They're in control. I've got it plenty well figured out. They started at the top at the city hall and the police department. What they did with the real humans, they... Why are you talking about? We've been invaded from some other universe, some other dimension. They're insects, mimicry, and more. Power to control minds. Your mind. My mind? Their entrance is here in Pikeville. They've taken over all of you. The whole town. Except me. We're up against an incredibly powerful enemy, but they have their limitations. That's our hope. They're limited. They can make mistakes. Janet shook her head. I don't understand, Ed. You must be insane. Insane? No. Just lucky. If I hadn't been down in the basement, I'd be like all the rest of you. Lois peered out the window. But I can't stand here talking. Get your coat. My coat! We're getting out of here. Out of Pikeville. We've got to get help. Fight this thing. They can be beaten. They're not infallible. It's going to be close, but we may make it if we hurry. Come on. He grabbed her arm roughly. Get your coat and call the twins. We're all leaving. Don't stop to pack. There's no time for that. White faced his wife moved forward the closet and got down her coat. Where are we going? Ed pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out on the floor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. They have the highways covered, of course, but there's a back road to Oak Grove. I got onto it once. It's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about it. The old ranch road? Good. Lord. It's completely closed. Nobody's supposed to drive over it. I know. Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. That's our best chance. Now, call down the twins and let's get going. Your car is full of gas, isn't it? Janet was daysed. The Chevy, I had it filled up yesterday afternoon. Janet moved toward the stairs. Ed, I call the twins. Ed unlocked the front door and pierced out. Nothing stirred. No sign of life. All right, so far. Come on down stairs. Janet called in a wavering voice. We're going out for a while. Now, Tommy's voice came. Hurry up, Ed barked. Get down here, both of you. Tommy appeared at the top of the stairs. I was doing my homework. We're starting fractions. Miss Parker said, if we don't get this done, you can forget about fractions. Ed grabbed his son as he came down the stairs and propelled him toward the door. Where's Jim? He's coming? Jim started down the stairs. What's up, Dad? We're going for a ride. A ride? Where? Ed turned to Janet. We'll leave the lights on and the TV said. Go turn it on. He pushed her toward the set. So they'll think we're still. He heard the buzz. And dropped instantly. The long butcher knife out. Second, he saw it coming down the stairs at him. Wings a blur of motion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy. It was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse. The thing hurtled at him. Cold, multi-elensed, inhumanized. Wings. Body still clothe and yellow t-shirt and jeans. The mimicked outline still stamped on it. A strange half turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing? A stinger. Loist stabbed while the edit. It retreated buzzing frantically. Loist rolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still a statues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loist stabbed again. This time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It bounced against the window. It bounced against the wall and fluttered down. Something left through his mind. A wall of force energy. An alien mind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his own, touching against him briefly, shockingly. An utterly alien present settled over him. And then it flickered out. As the thing collapsed in a broken heap on the rug. It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect. A fly of some kind. Yellow t-shirt. Jeans. His son Jimmy. He closed his mind tight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely, he scooped up his knife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood still. Neither of them moving. The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd been waiting for him. It was ten miles on foot. Ten long miles. Over rough country. Gullies. And open fields. And hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone. Loise opened the door. For a brief second, he looked back at his wife and son. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps. A moment later, he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness, for the edge of town. The early morning sunlight was blinding. Loise halted. Gasping for breath. Swing back and forth. Sweat ran down in his eyes. His clothing was torn, shredded by the bushes and thorns, through which he had crawled. Ten miles on his hands and knees. Crawling. Creeping through the night. His shoes were mudcaped. He was scratched and limping. Oddderly exhausted. But ahead of him lay up grove. He took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice he stumbled and fell, picking himself up and trudging on. His ears rang. Everything receded and wavered. But he was there. He had got out away from Pikeville. A farmer in a field gamed at him. From a house a young woman watched in wonder. Loise reached the road and turned into it. A head of him was a gasoline station and a drive-in. A couple of trucks. Some chickens pecking in the dirt. A dog tied with a string. The white clad attended watched suspiciously as he dragged himself up to the station. Thank God. He caught hold of the wall. I didn't think I was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear them buzzing. Buzzing and flitting around behind me. What happened? The attended demanded. You in a wreck? A hold up? Loise shook his head weirdly. They have the whole town. The city hall and the police station. They hung a man from the lamp post. That was the first thing I saw. They've got all the roads blocked. I saw them hovering over the cars coming in. About four this morning, I got beyond them. I knew it right away. I could feel them leave. And then the sun came up. The young attended licked his lips nervously. Here, out of your head. I better get a doctor. Get me into Oak Grove. Loise gasped. He sank down on the gravel. We've got to get started cleaning them out. Got to get started right away. They kept a tape recorder going all the time. He talked. When he had finished, the commissioner snapped off the recording and got to his feet. He stood for a moment. Deep in thought. Finally, he got out of cigarettes and lit up slowly. A frown on his beefy face. You don't believe me? Loise said. The commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loise pushed it impatiently away. Suit yourself. The commissioner moved over to the window. And stood for a time. Looking out at the town of Oak Grove. I believe you. He said abruptly. Loise staggered. Thank God. So you got away. The commissioner shook his head. You were down in your cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million. Loise sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. I have a theory he murmured. What is it? About them. Who they are? They take over one area at a time. Starting at the top. The highest level of authority. Working down from there. In a widening circle. When they're firmly in control. They go onto the next town. They spread. Slowly. I think it's been going on for a long time. A long time. Thousands of years. I don't think it's new. Why do you say that? When I was a kid. A picture they showed us in Bible League. A religious picture. An old print. The enemy gods defeated by Jehovah. Molock. Beels above. Moab. Baalin. Asteroth. They were all represented by figures. Loise looked up at the commissioner. The Elzab was represented as a giant fly. The commissioner granted. An old struggle. They've been defeated. The Bible isn't account of their defeats. They made gains. But finally, they're defeated. Why defeated? They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the Hebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The realization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they understood. Had a scape like I did. He clenched his fists. I killed one of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance. The commissioner nodded. Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped. As you did. Freak accidents. But the rest of the town is firmly in control. He turned from the window. Well, Mr. Loise, you seem to have figured everything out. Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the lamp post. I don't understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there? That would seem simple. The commissioner smiled faintly. Bait. Loise stiffened. His heart stopped beating. Bait? What do you mean? To draw you out. To make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was under control. And who had escaped. He was recolored with horror. Then they expect failures. They anticipated. He broke off. They were ready with a trap. And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known. The commissioner abruptly moved toward the door. Come along, Loise. There's a lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste. Loise started slowly to his feet. Numb. And the man, who was the man? I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger. All muddy and dirty. His face cut. Slashed. There was a strange look on the commissioner's face as he answered. Maybe he said softly. You'll understand that, too. Come along with me, Mr. Loise. He held the door open. His eyes gleaming. Loise caught a glimmer of the street in front of the police station. Policeman, a platform of some sort. A telephone pole. And a rope. Write this way. The commissioner said smiling coldly. As the sunset, the vice president of the Oak Grove Merchants Bank came up out of the vault. Through the heavy timeblocks, put on his hat and coat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were there. Hurrying home for dinner. Good night. The guard said locking the door after him. Good night. Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street toward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the vault, examining the layout of the safety deposit boxes. To see if there was room for another tear. He was glad to be finished. At the corner he halted. The streetlights had not yet come on. The street was dim. Everything was vague. He looked around and froze. From the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large and shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind. What the hell was it? Mason approached it whereal he. He wanted to get home. He was tired and hungry. He thought of his wife. His kids. A hot meal on the dinner table. But there was something about the dark bundle. Something ominous and ugly. The light was bad. He couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew him on. Made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made him uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened and fascinated. The strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it.

The Crack of Doom,Robert Cromie,15568,4.0,"November 10, 2022",[],0,"breVox.org. The crack of doom by Robert Chromey. Chapter one, the universe a mistake. The universe is a mistake. The spake Herbert Brand, a passenger on the majestic making for Queens Town Harbor, one evening early in the past year. Foolish as the words may seem, they were partly influential in leading to my terrible association with him, and all that is described in this book. Brand was standing beside me on the starboard side of the vessel. We had been discussing a current astronomical essay, as we watched the hazy blue line of the Irish coast rise on the horizon. This conversation was interrupted by Brand, who said impatiently, why tell us of stars distant so far from this insignificant little world of ours? So insignificant that even its own inhabitants speak disrespectfully of it, that it would take hundreds of years to telegraph to some of them, thousands to others, and millions to the rest. Why limit oneself to a mere million of years for dramatic illustration? When there is a star in space distant so far from us, that if a telegram left the earth for this very night and maintained forever its initial velocity, it would never reach that star. He said this without any apparent effort after rhetorical effect, but the suddenness with which he had presented a very obvious truism and a fresh light to me made the conception of the vastness of space, absolutely oppressive. In the hope of changing the subject I replied, nothing is gained by dwelling on these scientific speculations. The mind is only bewildered. The universe is inexplicable. The universe, he exclaimed. That is easily explained. The universe is a mistake. The greatest mistake of a century I suppose. I added somewhat annoyed. For I thought brand was laughing at me. Say of time, and I agree with you, he replied, careless of my astonishment. I did not answer him for some moments. This man brand was young in years, but middle-aged in the expression of his pale intellectual face and old, if age-be synonymous with knowledge and his ideas. His knowledge indeed was so exhaustive that the scientific pleasantries to which he was prone could always be justified, dialectically at least, by him when he was contradicted. Those who knew him well did not argue with him. I was always stumbling into intellectual pitfalls, for I had only known him since the steamer left New York. As to myself, there is little to be told. My history prior to my acquaintance with brand was commonplace. I was merely an active, athletic Englishman, Arthur Marcel by name. I had studied medicine and was a doctor in all but the degree. This certificate had been dispensed with owing to an unexpected legacy, on receipt of which I determined to devote it to the furtherance of my own amusement. In the pursuit of this object, I visited many lands and had become familiar with most of the beaten tracks of travel. I was returning to England after an absence of three years spent in aimless roaming. My age was 31 years, and my salient characteristic at the time was to hold fast by anything that interested me until my humor changed. Brands' conversational legaries had amused me on the voyage. His extraordinary comment on the universe decided me to cement our ship board acquaintance before reaching port. That explanation of yours, I said, lighting a fresh the garb and returning to a subject which I had so recently tried to shelf. It's not rather vague. For the present, it must serve, he answered absolutely. To force him into admitting that his phrase was only a flawless exclamation, or induced him to defend it. I said, it doesn't serve any reasonable purpose. It adds nothing to knowledge, as it stands, it is neither academic nor practical. Brand looked at me earnestly for a moment, and then said gravely, the academic value of the explanation will be shown to you if you will join a society I have found it, and its practicalness will soon be made plain, whether you join or not. What do you call this club of yours, I asked? We do not call the club, we call it a society, the quibono society, he answered coldly. I like the name, I returned. It is suggestive, it may mean anything, or nothing. You will learn later that the society means something a good deal in fact. This was said in the dry, unemotional tone, which I afterwards found was the only sign of disclosure brand ever permitted himself to show. His arrangements for going on shore at Queenstown had been made early in the day, but he left me to look for his sister of whom I had seen very little on the voyage. The weather had been rough, and she was not a good sailor, I had only a rare glimpse of a very dark and handsome girl, whose society possessed me for a strange attraction, although we were then almost strangers. Indeed, I regretted keenly as the time of our separation approached, having registered my luggage, consisting largely of curios and mementos of my travels, of which I was very careful, for Liverpool. My own time was valuedless, and it would have been more agreeable to me to continue the journey with the brands no matter where they went. There was a choppy sea on when we reached the entrance to the harbor, so the majestic steamed in between a car-liling camton fort and on to the man of war roads were the tender metas. By this time, brand and his sister were ready to go on shore, but as there was a heavy mailed be-tranship, we still had an hour at our disposal. For some time we paced the deck, exchanging common places on the voyage, and confidence is as to our future plans. It was almost dark, but not dark enough to prevent us from seeing those wonderfully green hills which land-locked the harbor. To me, the verdant woods and hills were delightful after the brown plains and interminable prairies on which I spent many months. As the lights of Queens town began to speck the slowly gathering gloom, Miss Brand asked me to point out Ross Dellen Castle. It could not be seen from the vessel, but the familiar legend was easily recalled, and this led us to talk about Irish tradition with its weird romance and never failing pathos. This interested her. Fried now from the last atudosy sickness, the girl became more fascinating to me every moment. Everything she said was worth listening to, apart from the charming manner in which it was said. To declare that she was an extremely pretty girl would not convey the strange, almost unearthly beauty of her face, as intellectual as her brothers, and of the charm of her slight but exquisitely molded figure. In her dark eyes there was a sympathy, a compassion that was new to me. It thrilled me with an emotion different from anything that my frankly happy but hitherto wholly selfish life had known. There was only one note in her conversation which jarred upon me. She was apt to drift into the extraordinary views of life and death, which were interesting when formulated by her eccentric brother, but pained me coming from her lips. In spite of this, the purpose I contemplated of joining brand society, a vote as it had been by his own whimsical observation, now took definite form. I would join that society. It would be the best way of keeping near to Natalie brand. Her brother returned to us to say that the tender was about to leave the ship. He had left us for half an hour. I did not notice his absence until he himself announced it. As we shook hands, I said to him, I have been thinking about that society of yours. I mean to join it. I'm very glad he replied. You will find it a new sensation, quite outside the beaten track, which you know so well. There was a shade of half kindly content in his voice, which missed me at the moment. I answered galey, knowing that he would not be offended by what was said in just. I'm sure I shall. If all the members are as mad as yourself, it will be the most interesting experience outside Bedlam that any man could wish for. I had a foretaste of that interest soon. As Miss Brand was walking to the gangway, a lamp shone full upon her gypsy face. The blue black hair, the dark eyes, and a deep red rose she wore in her bonnet, seemed to me an exquisite arrangement of harmonious color. And the thought flash into my mind very vividly, however trivial it may seem here when written down in cold words, the queen of women, and the queen of flowers. That is not precisely how my thought ran, but I cannot describe it better. The finer subtleties of the brain do not bear well the daylight of language. Brand drew her back and whispered to her. Then the sweet face, now slightly flushed, was turned to me again. Oh, thank you for that pretty thought. She said with a pleasant smile. You are too flattering. The queen of flowers is very true, but the queen of women, oh no, she made a graceful gesture of the sun and passed down the gangway. As the tender disappeared into the darkness, a tiny scrap of lace waved, and I knew vaguely that she was thinking of me, but how she read my thoughts so exactly I could not tell. That knowledge it has been my fate to gain. End of chapter 1.

Ever since the sun rose, I'd been looking ahead. The ship glided gently in smooth water. After a 60-day passage, I was anxious to make my land full, a fertile and beautiful island of the tropics. The more enthusiastic of its inhabitants delight in describing it as the pearl of the ocean. Well, let us call it the pearl. It's a good name. A pearl, distilling much sweetness upon the world. This is only a way of telling you that first-rate sugar cane is grown there. All the population of the pearl lives for it and by it. Sugar is their daily bread, as it were. And I was coming to them for a cargo of sugar in the hope of the crop having been good and of the freight's being high. Mr. Burns, my chief mate, made out the land first, and very soon I became entranced by this blue, pinnacle-daparition, almost transparent against the light of the sky, a mere emanation, the astral body of an island risen to greet me from afar. It is a rare phenomenon such a sight of the pearl at 60 miles off, and I wondered how seriously whether it was a good omen, whether what would meet me in that island would be as likely exceptional as this beautiful, dreamlike vision, so very few seam and have been privileged to behold. But horrored thoughts of business interfered with my enjoyment of an accomplished passage. I was anxious for success, and I wished to to do justice to the flattering latitude of my own as instructions contained in one noble phrase, we leave it to you to do the best you can with the ship. All the world being thus given me for a stage my abilities appeared to me no bigger than a pinhead. In while the wind dropped and Mr. Burns began to make disagreeable remarks about my usual bad luck. I believe it was his devotion for me which made him critically outspoken on every occasion. All the same I would not have put up with his humus if it had not been my lot at one time to nurse him through a desperate illness at sea. After snatching him out of the jaws of death, I'd speak it would have been absurd to throw away such an efficient officer. But sometimes I wish to be wood dismiss himself. We were late in closing with the land and had to anchor outside the harbour till next day. An unpleasant and unrestful night followed. In this roadstead strange to us both Burns and I remained on deck almost all the time. Clouds swirled down the poor-free crags under which we lay. The rising wind made a great bullying, always amongst the naked spars, with interludes of said moaning. I remarked that we had been in luck to fetch the anchorage before dark. It would have been an nasty anxious night to hang off a harbour under canvas. But my chief mate was uncompromising in his attitude. Like you call it sir, I, I, I usual luck. The sort of luck to thank God it's no worse. And so he fretted through the dark hours while I drew on my fund of philosophy. Ah, that it was an exasperating, weary, endless night, to be lying at anchor close under that black coast. The agitated water made snarling sounds all round the ship. At times a wild gust of wind out of a galley high up on the cliff struck on our rigging a harshed, plain-tive note, like the whale of a forsaken soul.

Section 1. First love by Emilia Partido Basón. How old was I then? 11 or 12 years? More probably 13. For before then, is too early to be seriously in love. But I won't venture to be certain, considering that in southern countries, the heart matures early if that organ is to blame for such perturbations. If I do not remember well when, I can at least say exactly how my first love revealed itself. I was very fond, as soon as my aunt had gone to church to perform her evening devotions of slipping into her bedroom and rummaging her chest of drawers, which she kept in admirable order. Those drawers were to me a museum. In them, I always came across something rare or antique, which exhaled an archaic in the steering set. The aroma of sandalwood fans, which perfumes her white linen. Pin cushions of satin now faded, knitted mittens, carefully wrapped into shoe paper. Prince of Saints, sewing materials, a redicule of blue velvet embroidered with bugles, an amber and silver rosary that would appear from the corners. I used a ponder over them and returned them to their place. But one day, I remember as well as if it were today, in the corner of the top drawer and lying on some collars of old lace, I saw something gold glittering. I put in my hand unwittingly crumpled the lace and drew out a portrait, an ivory miniature about three inches long and a frame of gold. I was struck at first sight, a sun being streamed through the window and fell upon the alluring form, which seemed to wish to step out of its dark background and come towards me. It was the most lovely creature, such as I had never seen, except in the dreams of my adolescence. The lady of the portrait must have been some 20 odd years. She was no simple maiden, no half open rose bud, but a woman in the full resplendency of her beauty. Her face was oval, but not too long, her lips full, half open and smiling. Her eyes cast a languishing side glance, and she had a dimple on her chin, as it formed by the tip of Cupid's playful finger. Her head dress was strange but elegant. A compact group of curls plastered comb-wise, one over the other covered her temples, and a basket of braided hair rose on top of her head. This old fashioned head dress, which was dressed up from the nape of her neck, disclosed all the softness of her fresh young throat, on which the dimple of her chin was reduplicated, more vaguely and delicately. As for the dress, I do not venture to consider whether our grandmother's were less modest than our wives are, or if the confessors of past times were more indulgent than those of the present, I am inclined to think the latter, for 70 years ago, women prided themselves upon being Christian-like, and devout, and would not have disobey the director of their conscience, and so grave, and imported a matter. What is undeniable is that, if in the present day, any lady were to present herself in the garb of the lady of the portrait, there would be a scandal. For from her waist, which began at her arm-dits, upwards, she was only veiled by light folds of the Athenus galls, which marked out, rather than covered, two mountains of snow, between which meander to thread of pearls. With further lack of modesty, she stretched out two rounded arms, worthy of Juno, ending in finally molded hands. When I say, hands, I am not exact, for strictly speaking, only one hand could be seen, and that held a richly-embordered hankerchief. Even today, I am astonished at the startling effect, which the contemplation of that miniature produced upon me, and how I remained in ecstasy, scarcely breathing, devouring the portrait with my eyes. I had already seen here and there, prints representing beautiful women. It often happened that in the illustrated papers, in the mythological engravings of our dining room, or in a shop window, that a beautiful face, or a harmonious and graceful figure, attracted my precuciously artistic gaze, but the miniature encountered in my ant's drawer, apart from its great beauty, appeared to me as if animated by a subtle and vital breath. You could see it was not that caprice of a painter, but the image of a real and actual person of flesh and blood. The warm and rich tone of the tense, made you surmise that the blood was tepid beneath that mother of pearl skin, the lips were slightly parted to disclose the enamel teeth. And to complete the illusion, they ran around the frame, a border of natural hair, chestnut and color, wavy and silky, which had grown on the temples of the original. As I have said, it was more than a copy. It was the reflection of a living person from whom I was only separated by a wall of glass. I seized it, breathed upon it, and it seemed to me that the warmth of the mysterious deity communicated itself to my lips and circulated through my veins. At this moment, I heard footsteps in the corridor. It was my ant returning from her prayers. I heard her asmatic cough, and the dragging of her gaudy feet. I had only just time to put the miniature into the drawer, shut it, and approached the window, adopting an innocent and indifferent attitude. My ant entered noisily, for the cold of the church had exasperated her guitar, now chronic. Upon seeing me, her wrinkled eyes brightened, and giving me a friendly tap with her withered hand, she asked me if I had been turning over for drawers as usual. Then with a chuckle. Wait a bit, wait a bit, she added, I have something for you, something you will like. And she pulled out of her vast pocket, a paper bag, and out of the bag, three or four gum laws and just sticking together in a cake, which gave me a feeling of nausea. My ant's appearance did not invite one to open one's mouth, and devour these sweets. The course of her years, her loss of teeth, her eyes dimmed to an unusual degree, the sprouting of a mustache, or bristles on her sunken in mouth, which was three inches wide, dull gray locks, fluttering above her shallow temples, a neck flassed and livid as the crest of the turkey went in good temper. In short, I did not take the lasenges. Ug, a feeling of indignation, a manly protest rose in me, and I said, forcibly, I do not want it, I don't want it. You don't want it, what a wonder, you are greedy you're going to cat. I am not a little boy, I exclaimed, drawing myself up and standing on tiptoes, I don't care for sweets. My ant looked at me, half good humoredly, and half ironically. And at last, giving way to the feeling of amusement, I caused her, burst out laughing, by which she disfigured herself, and exposed the horrible anatomy of her jaws. She laughed so hardily that her chin and nose met, hiding her lips, and emphasizing two wrinkles, or rather two deep furrows, and more than a dozen lines on her cheeks and eyelids. At the same time, her head and body shook with laughter, until it last, her cough began to interrupt the bird. And between laughing and coughing, the old lady involuntarily spluttered all over my face. Humiliated and full of disgust, I escaped rapidly, thins to my mother's room, where I washed myself with soap and water, and began to muse on the lady of the portrait. And from that day and hour, I could not keep my thoughts from her. As soon as my ant went out, to slip into her room, open the door, bring out the miniature, and lose myself in contemplation, was the work of a minute. By then to looking at it, I fancied that her languishing eyes through the volupuous veiling of her eyelashes, or fixed in mine, and that her white bosom heaved. I became ashamed to kiss her, imagining she would be annoyed at my audacity, and only pressed her to my heart, or held her against my cheek, all my actions and thoughts refer to the lady. I behaved towards her with the most extraordinary refinement and super delicacy. Before entering my ant's room, and opening the longed-forward door, I washed, combed my hair, and tidied myself, as I have seen as usually done before repairing to a love appointment. I often happened to meet in the street, other boys of my age, very proud of their slip of a sweetheart, who would exaltingly show me love letters, photographs, and flowers, and who asked me, if I hadn't a sweetheart with whom to correspond, a feeling of inexplicable bashfulness tied my tongue, and I only replied with an enigmatic and haughty smile, and when they questioned me, I asked to what I thought of the beauty of their little maidens, I would shrug my shoulders and disdainfully call them ugly mugs. One Sunday, I went to play in the house of some little girl cousins. Really, very, pretty, the eldest of whom was not yet 15. We were amusing ourselves looking into a stereoscope. When suddenly, one of the little girls, the youngest, who counted 12 summers at most, secretly seized my hand, and in some confusion and blushing as red as a brusher, was brute in my ear. Take this. At the same time, I felt in the palm of my hand, something soft and fresh, and saw that it was a rose bud with its green foliage. The little girl ran away smiling, and casting a side glance at me, but I, with a pure itsenism worthy of Joseph, cried out in my turn. Take this, and I threw the rose bud at her nose. I rebuffed, which made her tearful and petished with me the whole afternoon, and for which she has not pardoned me even now. Though she is married and has three children. The two or three hours, which my aunt spent morning and evening together at church, being too short from my admiration of the entrancing portrait. I resolved it last to keep the miniature in my pocket, and went about all day hiding myself from people, just as if I had committed some crime. I fancy that the portrait from the depth of its prison of cloth could see all my actions, and I arrived at such a ridiculous extremity, that if I wanted to scratch myself, pull up my sock, or do anything else not in keeping with the idealism of my chased love, I drew out the miniature, put it in a safe place, and then considered myself free to do whatever I wanted. In fact, since I had accomplished the theft, there was no limit to my vagaries. At night, I hid it under the pillow, and slept in an attitude of defense. The portrait remained near the wall. I outside, and I awoke a thousand times fearing somebody would come to bereave me of my treasure. At last, I drew it from beneath the pillow, and slipped it between my night shirt and left breast, on which the following day could be seen the imprint of the chasing of the frame. The contact of the deer miniature gave me delicious dreams, the lady of the portrait, not in effigy, but in her natural size and proportions, alive, graceful, affable, beautiful, would come towards me to conduct me to her palace by a rapid and flying train. With sweet authority, she would make me sit on a stool at her feet, and would pass her beautifully molded hand over my head, caressing my brow, my eyes, my loose curls. I read to her, out of a big missile, or played the loop, and she damed to smile, thanking me for the pleasure, which my reading and songs gave her. At last, romantic reminisces overflowed in my brain, and sometimes I was a page, and sometimes a troubadour. With all these fancipal ideas, the fact is that I began to grow thin quite perceptibly, which was observed with great disquietitude in my parents and my aunt. In this dangerous and critical age of development, everything is alarming, said my father, who used to read books of medicine, and anxiously studied my dark eyelids, my dull eyes, my contracted and pale lips, and above all, the complete lack of appetite, which had taken possession of me. Play, boy, eat, boy, he would say to me, and I replied to him, dejectedly, I don't feel inclined. They began to talk of distractions, offered to take me to the theatre, stop to my studies, and gave me foaming new milk to drink. Afterwards, they poured cold water over my head, and back to fortify my nerves, and I noticed that my father at table or in the morning when I went to his bedroom to bid him good morning, would gaze at me fixedly for some little time, and would sometimes pass his hand down my spine, feeling the vertebrae. I hypocritically lowered my eyes, resolved to die rather than confess my crime. As soon as I was free from the affectionate, solicitude of my family, I found myself alone with my lady of the portrait. At last, to get nearer to her, I thought I would do away with the cold crystal. I trembled upon putting this into execution, but at last, my love prevailed over the vague fear, with which such a profination filled me, and with skillful cunning I succeeded in pulling away the glass, and exposing the eye replate. As I pressed my lips to the painting, I could sit the slight fragrance of the border of hair, and I imagined to myself even more realistically that it was a living person who mow as grasping with my trembling hands. A feeling of faintingness overpowered me, and I fell unconscious on the sofa, tightly holding the miniature. When I came to my senses, I saw my father, my mother, my aunt, all bending anxiously over me. I read their terror and alarm in their faces. My father was feeling my pulse, shaking his head and murmuring, his pulse is nothing but a flutter, you can scarcely feel it. My aunt, with her claw-like fingers, was trying to take the portrait for me, and I was mechanically hiding it and grasping it more firmly. But my dear boy, let go, you were spwelling it. She exclaimed, don't you see you were smudging it? I am not scolding you my dear, I will show it to you as often as you'd like, but don't destroy it, let go, you are injuring it. Let him have it, beg to my mother, the boy is not well. Of all things to ask, reply the old maid, let him have it, and who will paint another like this? Or make me as I was then. Today, nobody paints miniatures. It is a thing of the past, and I also am a thing of the past, and today I'm not what is represented there. My eyes dilated with horror, my fingers released their hold on the picture. I don't know how I was able to articulate you, the portrait, the portrait is you. Don't you think I am as pretty now, boy? Bah, one is better looking at 23 than at the night, I don't know what, for I have forgotten how old I am. My head drooped, and I almost fainted again. Anyway, my father lifted me in his arms onto the bed and made me swallow some tablespoonfuls of ports. I recovered very quickly, and never wished to enter my aunt's room again.

They were a peaceful people and somehow couldn't stand the thought of executing their only criminal. The answer was to discover a hero from yesterday by Robert Randall. The day Lugert's criminals gunned down three citizens in a bold, broad daylight robbery. Domnus Carson, the third speaker of the council, said, I think I've got an answer. Answer to what, said Mergedon Daryl, fourth speaker. To Lugert, said Carson, the weapon we can use against that throwback who's been terrorizing us all. Daryl sounded weary. There is no answer to Lugert I'm afraid. Where peaceful people he's a throwback to a more violent age. There's no way to cope with him. Would you want to be the one to shoot him down? Carson shuddered and said, no, not me. Of course not. I'm no more capable of violence than anyone else. But Lugert can be stopped. We can get help. From where? From the past, said Carson, from the ugly crime-ridden world we evolved out of. Dr. Lorenz of the science council has developed a time net, which, of course, of course, Daryl explained, bring a man out of the past. A man who won't be inhibited by our innate hatred of violence, a man who will be able to deal with Lugert as he deserves. He rose and strode around the long council room in quick, nervous steps. Calleritz, Carson, get him at work on the project at once. We can't waste any more time. There's no telling when Lugert might. The vis-a-phone chimed three times. Carson crossed the room and depressed the receiving stud. On the screen, the features of a thick face-stucky man appear. Lugert, what do you want? I'm pleased you recognized me so quickly, speaker Carson, said the stocky man and a slow, deep voice. My fame must be spreading then. You didn't call to chat with us, Lugert. What is it you want? Lugert's face hardened slowly. You're right. I didn't call to chat. I called to tell you to get out. What's that? I said, get out. Pick up your records and papers and clear out of the government building, Carson. You and all the rest of you. I'm taking over. Carson pailed. Taking over the government? Again, the confident, cheerful, steel-hard grin that had become the Lugert trademark, he and such an astonishingly brief time. How far? Why, Carson, I can go as far as I like. There is one of you who dare say no to anything I ask. And now I'm asking for the government. Go ahead, refuse, get in, digmit, threaten me. All this easy winning bores me, Carson. Carson stared at the thick featured face framed by the vis-a-Screen. If one again, he said, after a pause, we can't fight you, Lugert. How much time do we have to evacuate the government building? How much do you need? Carson thought for a moment. A week, at least, is that all right? One week, no more. Lugert agreed. Why, man, and I will come up to take over things at noon on 7 September. He chuckled. 7 September 2531. A day to go down in history. A Carson? He broke the connection. Carson turned to the dead screen and looked at Speaker Dorel. Well, there's our ultimatum, he said, one week to get out and then Lugert takes over. That means we'll have to move fast, said Dorel. You'd better call Dr. Lorenz, only a week. Carson was already busy punching out Lorenz's code numbers on the vis-a-phone. When the scientist appeared, Carson quickly sketched out the situation as it stood. Lorenz's eyes widened when Carson told of Lugert's threat. Then the Speaker went on to outline the part Lorenz and his time net would play in the attempt to defeat Lugert. I'll see what I can do, Lorens promised. I'll try to find the man we're looking for. Can you do it in two days or less? I hope so, Lorenz said. It took two days. Then Lorenz ran the office of the council and told Carson, it's worked. The time net, you've got the man? I have. I'll bring him right over. Lorenz entered the council room a while later, followed by a tall, thin, lean-faced man, dressed in archaic clothing. His heart thumped excitedly. Here was a man he thought. Here was a hero from yesterday who would put an end to the threat Lugert represented. The S.E.S. speaker Carson and speaker Darrell of our governing council, Lorenz said, the man from the past not incurredly. You can call me Jack. His voice was cold, flat, with a curious twang of a regional accent in it. The vowel pronunciation was odd, as was to be expected. Carson eyed the hard-faced stranger. He didn't seem to have an ounce of fat on him. He looked tough, uncompromising. I think you'll do. He said, after a moment's study, you've got the stuff. Banks said Jack and a rye of voice, suppose you line the program out for me now. Give me the picture. Tell me what I'm here for. Carson frowned. You're here to help us, because we're helpless ourselves. Did Dr. Lorenz tell you what the characteristics of this world are? He said a few things, you fill me in. It's 300 years since we last had a war of any sort. Crime has been extinct 150 years, until Lugert. Lugert, I heard of him. Who is he? He is the man you're going to kill for us. Carson said bluntly. The man named Jack Grind. Oh, a rubout job. I think that's the term said Carson. Lugerts a throwback, a man out of the past, a man out of your time, suddenly reborn in our era for God knows what reason. He's cold and hard and utterly ruthless. Nothing stops him. We're powerless. The compulsion against violence is too strong in us. Just a bunch of patsies, Jack said, Lugert snaps the whip and you lie down and played dead when he says so. That it. It took Carson a few moments to digest the strange idioms. Finally he said, right, he began small with petty thefts and burglaries. He took anything he wanted. Then he began branching out. He compelled a scientist to create a serum for him that would instill absolute loyalty to him in anyone who took it. Using the serum he built up a band of henchmen who share his violent ways. Two days ago he decided to take the ultimate grab for power. He ordered us to evacuate the government building and let him take over. And you said, yes, Jack remarked, what else could we do? But we have a weapon. You share Lugert's way of life. We don't. We can strike at him indirectly through you. You ought me to kill this Lugert. What's in it for me? What? I said, what's in it for me? What do I get out of it besides the risk of a punctured hide? I don't do these things for my health, Carson. Carson thought about it for a moment. Of course, there would have to be some reward wouldn't there. Well, what would you want? We can supply virtually anything if you'll do the job properly. Osmarydem, sapphires, books, women. The man named Jack shook his head. Gould, he said. Carson was startled. Gold. But why would you want? Oh, very well. Gold is the reigning object of value in your day, isn't it? Would 25 pounds be enough? The man for the past smiled unwarmly. Quite enough, he said. He got yourself a deal. The man named Jack cautiously approached the big building that served as a headquarters for a Lugert until the time when he would move into the sprawling area of the government building. Jack wore modern clothes. His own shabby ancient ones were carefully stored away in a laboratory closet. His hair was closed cropped in the current fashion. But inside his skull was the mind of a 20th century man. And hidden in the folds of his vest was a 20th century automatic. A snub nose 38, ready to spit death. The day was five September, 2531. He had been in this strange world of the future three days. And if all went well, he would return to his own time today. He had spent the three days studying the approach to Lugert's headquarters, familiarizing himself with the layout, readying himself for the killing that had to be done. He was thinking. Funny old duck that Carson. They all are. Imagine letting somebody like Lugert push them all over the place because all the fights been bred out of them. Well, in 600 years, a lot can happen. He shrugged. It wasn't his business to worry about the doings of his remote descendants. His business was to kill. He knew that Lugert's personal suite was on the eighth floor of the building that he was guarded by one man outside the door, one at the elevator entrance, and several in the lobby. He didn't have to worry about the ones in the lobby. He didn't really have to worry about any of them on the way in. They wouldn't be expecting anyone dangerous. The only dangerous people in this world were Lugert in his henchmen. And they'd probably be off guard when he came by. He is four arm-eached, where Lourrance had inserted a sliver of metal. The old scientists had been very apologetic. I'm sorry, Jack, but we have to do this. We can't risk having another Lugert. This is to make sure you don't get delusions of power once you finish off Lugert. What do you mean? I mean we can control you hypnotically through this generator I've embedded in your arm. Just in case you decide not to go back to your own time when you're through here. Doe, or he, I wouldn't want to run this place. He couldn't blame them for being cautious. Not at all. They'd be even more helpless before him than they would be under Lugert after all. He drew near the big building. The garden front said, Who are you on? Where are you going? Jack made his voice as subservient sounding as he could. He said, I am from Speaker Carson. I'd like to see Lugert, the guard frowned. How come Carson didn't just phone the boss? Beats me, Jack said, must be top secret. The guard frowned at Jack's strange language, shrugged and sent him on in. He passed rapidly through the lobby and reached the elevator. A guard inside the elevator, wanted to know where he was going. I am from Speaker Carson, he said, I have an urgent message to deliver to Lugert. The guard held out his hand. Let's have it. I'll take it to him. The boss doesn't like to meet strangers. Smiling coldly, Jack fumbled in his pocket and withdrew the 38. It fired once. The silencer muffled the sound down to a squirt. A neat hole appeared in the elevator operator's hand. Still smiling, Jack pressed eight and waited for the door to close. Three minutes and two killings later, he stood outside the office of Lugert himself. The elevator was clear now and the floor was empty of henchmen. That would make the getaway easier, Jack thought. He knocked. Who's there, a voice growled? Mr. Lugert? Yeah, who's there and what do you want? An urgent message from Speaker Carson, sir. Very important that I see you, Mr. Lugert. After a considerable pause, the door swung open. Lugert stood there, wearing a glittering plastic robe. He hadn't shaved. He was short and squat and fierce looking. Jack smiled and drew the gun. Please step inside, keep your hands in the air. He said quietly, and don't make a fuss. This gun happens to kill people when it goes off. Lugert stepped back. Jack noticed the man didn't seem frightened and wondered whether it was because Lugert just didn't believe another man could probably offer danger or because Lugert was without fear. He said, I've killed three year henchmen. I am figuring on killing you now. Speaker Carson is paying me to do it, Lugert. Quietly, Lugert said, and who are you? Where'd you come from? You can call me Jack. You don't know me. I can see there's a toughness about you. Lugert said, you're like me. I didn't think there were any others like me in the world. Where did Carson find you? In the past, Lugert, in yesterday. He dredged me up from the 20th century. There were lots like you and me then, Lugert. For the first time, fear showed in Lugert's face. A dribblet, a perspiration, snake down the side of his fleshy jaw. Pala, then he had been before. He said, from the past, then you can really kill me. Jack nodded. I'm going to, Carson's paying me 25 pounds of gold for it. Gold, but that's tough, worthless. You can find it anywhere. What do you want gold for? In my time, said Jack, the stuff wasn't succumbed. It was worth plenty. Times change. A crafty glint showed in Lugert's eyes. Or just a hired killer, then, a man without conscience. Suppose I offer you 30 pounds of gold not to kill me. 50 pounds. 100. The generator injects arm twitched warningly. He knew Carson and Lorenz were listening in. Now, he said, there is no percentage in it. You don't have the time net. You can't send me back to my own time. How stick with their offer? No, look, we can be partners. Here are the kind of man I could get to like, Jack. We'll work together. You and me. 50, 50. And even split. Again, the generator twitched. Jack sighed. Sorry, Lugert. Can't do it. I made an agreement and I'm going to stick to it. I'm going to kill you. That's what screamed down Lugert's face. It's not fair, he said. I had this world under my thumb. And then they had to find you somewhere. Why? Why they have to mess everything up? Sorry, Lugert. It's just a lousy break for you. Jack said, emotionlessly. This is the way it's going to be. No, Lugert yelled. Jack raised the 38. Lugert threw up his hands as if to protect himself, but Jack's fingers tightened anyway. The gun went squirch. Lugert toppled heavily to the floor. He lay there on the heavy pile of rug, his blood spilling out, and staining the brown carpet a deep red. Jack looked at him calmly. Then he turned and left the room. The floor was still empty. Quietly, he got into the unintended elevator, wrote it to the lobby, and stepped out into the street. The whole job had taken 10 minutes, 10 minutes, and four killings, and he hadn't even raised a sweat. Darrell and Carson and Dr. Lorenz were waiting for him in the council room of the government building when he got back. Great work, Carson said. He looked pale and shaken. We watched the whole thing over the transmitter, Lorenz built into you. Every step. It was well done. Thanks, Jack said. Is it gold ready? Lorenz handed him a heavy satchel. It's here, 25 pounds. Plus 5 pounds extra for your cooperation. Thanks again, Jack said. Had to be of help. He didn't mention the moments when he wavered when he had nearly gone over to Lugert side. Probably would have if it hadn't been for the generator planted in his arm. He wondered briefly how it would have been living here with all these quiet, philosophical types. He said, I suppose you're going to send me back to my own time now. Lorenz nodded. The four of them went to Lorenz's office and Jack climbed back into the elaborate harness. Lorenz bustled around him, making adjustments carefully. We have to gauge this thing to the minute, you know, he explained. No mistakes. I appreciate the care, Jack said. He held tightly to his satchel. We owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude, Carson said. A debt that no satchel of gold could ever repay. You've done us a great service. Here a hero, Jack, a savior of humanity. We'd never have beaten Lugert without you. Ready to go, Lorenz said. He threw the switch. Time begins a swirl around the killer from the past. As 2531 started to fade away from him, he grand for the last time and said, imagine that me, a hero. I like that me, John Dillager, a savior of humanity. And then he was gone.

So long as you have but yourself to think of, you may easily be pardoned for thinking very little of that self for being careless of its advantage and letting favorable opportunities slip through your fingers. But suppose you find out in a moment without warning that your interests are another's interests, that to push your own fortune is to push someone else's fortune much dearer to you than yourself and that in short you are no longer you at all. But the active member of a double personality is as startling a sensation as can well be conceived. This was the idea which Edgar had received into his mind for the first time and it was not wonderful that it excited me intoxicated him, almost beyond his power of self-control. I say for the first time though he had been on the eve of asking Gussie Thornely to marry him three years before and had therefore realized or thought he realized what it would be to enter into such a relationship. But in those days Edgar was rich and petted by the world and his bride would have been only a delight and honor the more not anything calling for sacrifice or effort on his part. He could have given her everything she desired in the world without losing a night rest or disturbing a single habit. Now the case was very different. The newborn pride which had made him to his own surprise so reluctant to apply to anyone for employment and so little satisfied to dance attendance on Lord New March died at that single blow. Dance attendance on Lord New March ask anybody everybody for work yes to be sure he would have never think twice for had he not now heard a thing of? A glow of exhilaration came over him he had been careless in different sluggish so long as it was himself only that had to be thought of. Thinking of himself did not suit Edgar. He got sick of the subject and detested himself and felt a hundred pricks of annoyance at the thought of being a suitor and applicant for patronage bearing the scorns of office unwunting as patient merit a great man's anti-room. But now what is he care for those petty annoyances? Why should he object like a petish child to ask for what he wanted? It was for her. He became himself again the moment that the strange and penetrating sweetness of this suggestion which he declared to himself was incredible yet believed with all his heart, stole into his soul. This had been what he wanted all long to have someone to work for, someone to give him an object in life. Lady Mary had not a notion what she was doing when she set light to the fire which was all ready for that touch. Ready to blaze up and carry with it her own schemes as well as her sister's precautions. I suppose it was by reason of the fundamental difference between man and woman that neither of these ladies divine how their hint would act upon Edgar. They thought his virtue for which they half despised him, for women always have a secret sympathy for the selfish order of men in all questions of love was so great that he might be trusted to restrain even gussy herself in her impetiosity as they called it, without considering that the young man was disposed to make a goddess of gussy to take her will for law and compass heaven and earth to procure her a gratification. Gussy, though she held herself justified in her unswerving attachment to Edgar by the fact that had it not been for his misfortune she would long ago have been his wife, would not withstanding this consolation have died of shame that she known how entirely her secret had been betrayed. But the betrayal was as a new life to Edgar. His heart rose with all its natural buoyancy. He seemed to himself to spur on his loveliness, his inactivity, his depressed and ejected state from him. That evening he begiled his hosts into numberless discussions out of sheer lightness of heart. He'd laughed at Lady Mary about her educational mania, boldly putting forth its comic side and begging to know whether German lectures and the use of the globes were so much better as it means of education than life itself, with all its many complexities and questions its hard lessons its experience which no one can escape. If a demigod from the sixth form were to come down and seat himself on a bench in a dame school, cried Edgar, why to be sure he might learn something? But what would you think of the wisdom of the proceeding? I am not a demigod from the sixth form, said Lady Mary. Pardon me but you are, you've been among the reached in class all your life, which of itself is an enormous cultivation. You have lived familiarly with people who guide the nation, you have spoken with most of those who are known to be worth speaking to, in England at least. And you have had a good share of the problems of life's abitity. Mr Tottenham's whole career, for instance, which he says you decided, what is that? Said Mr Tottenham looking up. Whatever it is that you say is quite true, I don't know if it's anything much worth calling a career but, such as it is, it's all her doing. You're right there. I am backed up by indisputable testimony, said Edgar, laughing. And in the face of all this, you can come and tell me that you want to educate your mind by means of the feebleist of lectures. Lady Mary, are you laughing at us or are the dry lessons of grammar and such like scaffolding, really, of more use in educating the mind, then the far higher lessons of life? How you set yourself to discourage me? Cride Lady Mary, half angry, half laughing. That is not what you mean, Mr. Ancho. You mean that it is hopeless to train women to the accuracy, the exactness of thought which men are trained to? I understand you, though you put it so much more, prettyly. I'm afraid I don't know what accuracy means, said Edgar, and exactness of thought suggests only Lord New March to me, and heaven delivers from prigs, male and female, if you find however that the mass of young university men are so accurate, so exact, so accomplished, so trained to think well and clearly that I envy you, your eyes and perceptions for to me, they have a very different appearance. Many of them I should say never think at all, and no a good deal less than Phil does of whom I am the unworthy instructor, save the mark he added with a laugh. On the whole, honours have shoured upon my head, I have had greatness thrust upon me like Malvallio, not only to instruct Phil, but to help to educate Lady Mary Tottenham. What a frightful imposter I should feel myself, if all this were my doing, not yours. Lady Mary laughed too, but not without a little flush of a fence, it even crossed her mind to wonder whether the young man had taken more wine than usual, for there was an exhilaration, a boldness, an alarm about him which he had never perceived before. She looked at him with mingled suspicion and indignation, but caught such a glance from his eyes, which were full of a new warmth, life and meaning that Lady Mary dropped hers, confused and confounded, not knowing what to make of it. Had the porter and the footman and the underguardner who had seen Edgar Kiss Lady Mary's hand being present at that moment, they would certainly have drawn conclusions very unfavorable to Mr Tottenham's piece of mind, but that unsuspecting personage sat engaged in his own occupation and took no notice. He was turning over some papers which he had brought back with him from Tottenham's that very day. When you two have done sparring, he said, time will wait for no man, and here we are within a few days of the entertainment of the shop. Earned sure I wish you would go in with me a Wednesday and help me to help them in their arrangements. I have asked a few people for the first time and it will be amusing to see the fine ladies, art customers, making themselves agreeable to my assistance. By the way, better fair of Miss Lockwood gives me a great deal of uneasiness, I don't like to send her away. She seemed disposed to confide in you, my dear fellow. I will go and secure her confidence, sit at your with that gay readiness for everything which Lady Mary with such a maze had remarked already in his turn. Up to this moment he had wanted confidence in himself and carried into everything the insuciants of a man who takes up with friendliness the interests of others, but has none of his own. All this was changed. He was another man, liberated somehow from change which he had never realized until now when she saw they were broken. Could her conversation with him today have anything to do with it? Lady Mary was a very clever woman but she groked in vain in the dark for some insight into the mind of this young man who had seemed to her so simple. And the less she understood him, the more she respected Edgar, nay her respect for him began to increase from the moment when she found out that he was not so absolutely virtuous as she had taken him to be. Next day as soon as fills lessons were over, Edgar shut himself up and with a flush upon his face and a certain tremor which seemed to him to make his hand and his writing by some curious paradox more firm than usual began to write letters. He wrote to Lord Newmarch. He wrote to one or two others who may had known in his moment of prosperity with a baldness and a freedom at which he was himself astonished. He recalled to his old acquaintances without feeling the least hesitation in doing so, the story of his past life, about which he had been up to this moment, so proudly silent and appealed to them to find him something to do. He wrote not as a humble suitor does but as one conscious of no humiliation in asking. The last time he had asked he had been conscious of humiliation but every shadow of that self-consciousness had blown away from him now. He wondered at himself even while he looked at those letters closed and directed on his writing table. What was it that had taken away from him all sense of dislike to this proceeding? All his old inclination to let things go as they would, with that curious tremor which was so full of firmness and force still vibrating through him. He went out. Avoiding Phil, who was lying in wait for him and who moaned his absence like a sheep deprived of its lamb, which I think was something like the parental feeling Phil experience for his tutor and set out for a long solitary walk across country, leaping ditches and stumbling across plowed fields by way of exhausting a little of his own super abundant force and energy. Only a dare to since how dreary was the feeling with which he had left the house, where perhaps for all he knew, does he was at the moment thinking whether sickening at his heart, which seems to make all nature dim, how he must never see her again. How he had pledged himself to keep out of the way. Never to put himself consciously, where he might have even the dreary satisfaction of a look at her. The same pledge was upon him still and Edgar was ready to keep it to the last letter of his promise, but now it had become a simple dead letter. There was no more force, no more vital power in it to keep the two apart, who had but one strong wish between them. He could keep it now gale, knowing that he was in heart emancipated from it. There was nothing he could not have done on that brilliant wintery afternoon when the sun shone upon him as if he had wanted cheering and every pool glittered and the sky warmed and flushed under his gaze with all the delightful sicker fantasy of nature for the happy. The dullest afternoon would have been just the same to Edgar. He was liberated, he was inspired, he felt himself a strong man and with his life before him. Cold winds and dreary skies would have no effect upon his spirits, and for this reason I suppose everything shone on him and flattered, to him that half shall be given. He was not to get back, however, without being rose from this beotific condition to a consciousness of his humanity. As he passed through the village, chance through Edgar's eye to the house which Lady Mary had noted as that of the doctor and about which Miss Annetta Baker had discourseed so largely. A cab was of a door, boxes were standing about the steps, and an animated conversation seemed to be going on between two men, one an elderly passenger of her to hat, who stood on the steps with the air of a man defending his door against an invader, while another and younger figure standing in front of the cab seemed to demand admission. The new doctor has arrived before the old one is ready to go away. Edgar said to himself amused by the awkwardness of the situation. He slackened his pace that the altercation might be over before he passed, and saw the coachman thoroughly putting back again the boxes upon the cab. The old doctor pointed over Edgar's head to a cottage in the distance where he was aware there was lodgings to be had, and as Edgar approached, the new doctor, as he supposed the stranger to be, turned reluctantly away, with a word to someone in the cab, which also began to turn slowly round to follow him. The stranger came along the broad sandy road which encircled the green towards Edgar, who on his side approached slowly. What was there in this slim, a tall figure which filled him with vague reminiscences? He got interested in spite of himself, what did someone he had known in his better days? He was it. The same fancy has supposed rows in the mind of the newcomer. When he turned round for the second time, after various communications with the inmates of the cab, and suddenly perceived Edgar, who was now within speaking distance, he gave a perceptible start. Either his reminiscences were less vague, or he was more prepared for the possibility of such a meeting. He hurried forward holding at his hand, while Edgar stood still like one stunned, Dr. Murray. He said, at last, feeling for the moment as if he had been transported back to Loch Ahrer, he was too bewildered to say any more. You are very much surprised to see me, said Charles Murray, with his half-rank, half-side-long aspect, and it is not wonderful. When we met last, I had not thought of making any move, but circumstances changed, and a change through this in my way. Is it possible that we are so lucky as to find you a resident here? For the moment, said Edgar, but indeed I am very much surprised. You are to be Dr. Frank's successor. It is very often, you should hit upon this village of all the world. I hope it is a chance not disagreeable to either of us, said the young Dr. with a glance of the suspicion which was natural to him. But circumstances once more seem against us. He added hurriedly going back to the annoyance which was then, uppermost, he, if I have to go hunting through a strange place for lodgings of this hour. My sister tired by a long journey. By the way, you have not seen Margaret, she is behind in the cab, all because the Franks for Suith cannot go out of their house when they engage to do so. But the poor lady I suppose could not help it, said Edgar, according to what I have heard. No, I suppose she couldn't help it. On the whole, he allowed, crossly. Capman, stop a moment. Stop, I tell you. Margaret, here is someone you have often heard of. Our cousin, who has been so good to the dear old granny, Edgar, are in shore. Dr. Charles pronounced these last words with a sense of going further than he had ever gone before, in intimacy with Edgar. He had never ventured to call his cousin by his Christian name, and even now it was brought in by a sidewind as it were and scarcely meant so much as a director dress. Edgar turned with some curiosity to the cab to see the sister whom he had seen waiting at the station for Dr. Murray some months ago. He expected to see a pretty and graceful young woman, but he was not prepared for the beauty of the face which looked at him from the carriage window, with a soft, appealing smile such as turn's men's heads. She was tall with a slight stoop, though that he could not see, and wore a hat with a long feather which drooped with a graceful undulation somewhat similar he thought to the little bow she made him. She was pale with very fine refined features, a large pair of the softest, most pathetic blue eyes, and that smile, which seemed to supplicate and implore for sympathy. There was much in Margaret's history which seemed to give special meaning to the plain to the effect in character of her face, but her face was so by nature, and looked as if its owner threw herself upon your sympathies when indeed yet, they thought of anything of the sort. A little girl of six or seven hung upon her standing up in the carriage and leaning closely against her mother's shoulder, in that clinging, inseparable attitude which, especially when child and mother are both exceptionally handsome, goes to the heart of the spectator. Edgar was subjugated at once, he took off his hat and went reverently to the carriage door as if she had been a saint. It is very pleasant that you should be here, and I am very glad to see you. She said, in soft, scotch accents, in which there was a plaintive, almost a complaining tone. Edgar found himself immediately voluble in his regrets as to the annoyance of the uncomfortable reception, and, air he knew what he was doing, had volunteered to go with Dr Charles to the lodgings, to introduce him, and to see whether they were of satisfactory. He could not quite understand why he had done it, and thus associated himself with a man who did not impress him favorably. As soon as he had turned from the door of the cab, I am lost sight of that beautiful face. Of course he could not help it, he could not have refused his good offices to any stranger, he said to himself. He went on with his cousin to the cottage, whether landlady curts it most deeply to the gentleman from topnames, and was doubly anxious to serve people who were his friends, and before he left he had seen the beautiful new camera, her little girl is always standing by her side, leaving against her, seated on a sofa by a comfortable fire, and forgetting, or seeming to forget her for teaks. Dr Charles could not smile so sweetly or look so interesting as his sister. He continued to convey against Dr Frank's and his ratcheness in maintaining possession of the house. But the poor think could not help it. Said Margaret, in her plaintiff voice, but nor without a gleam of fun, if that were possible without absolutely desecration in her eyes. They should not have stayed till the last moment, they should have made sure that nothing would happen, the doctor said, hurrying in and out, and filling the little city room with cloaks and raps and many small articles. Margaret made no attempt to help him, but she gave Edgar a look which seemed to say, for give him, poor fellow he is worried and I am so sorry, he is not a good temper. Edgar did not know what to make of this angelic cousin. He walked away in the darkening after he had seen them settled, with a curious feeling which he could not explain to himself. Was he guilty of the meanness of being annoyed by the arrival of these relatives who were in a position so different from that of his other friends? Was it possible that so poultry, so miserable a feeling, could enter his mind? Or what was it? Edgar could render no distinct account to himself of the sensation which depressed him, but as he walked rapidly up the avenue in the quickly falling darkness, he felt that something had happened, which somehow or other he could not tell how, was to affect his future life.

Recording by Tasha Mapes, Out of the Closet, a collection of early LGBTQ+. The Child's Champion by Walt Whitman. Just after sunset, one evening in summer, that pleasant hour when the air is balmy, the light loses its glare, and all around is imbued with soothing quiet. On the doorstep of a house, their sat an elderly woman, waiting the arrival of her son. The house was in a straggling village, some 50 miles from the Great City, whose spires and sea-slist clang rise up, where the Hudson pours four-thips waters. She, who sat on the doorstep, was a widow, her neat white cap covered locks of grey, and her dress, though clean, was patched and exceedingly homely. Her house, for the tenement she occupied was her own, was very little and very old. Trees clustered around it so thickly as almost a hide its color, that blackish grey color, which belongs to old wooden houses that have never been painted. And to get it, you had to enter a little rickety gate, and walk through a short path, bordered by carrot beds and beets and other vegetables. The sun, whom she was expecting, was her only child. About a year before, he had been bound apprentice to a rich farmer in the place, and after finishing his daily tasks, he was in the habit of spending half an hour at his mother's. On the present occasion, the shadows of the night had settled heavily before the youth made his appearance. When he did his walk was slow and dragging, and all his motions were languid, as if from great weariness. He opened the gate, came through the path, and sat down by his mother in silence. He was so in tonight charlie, said the widow, after a minute's pause, when she found that he returned to no answer to her greetings. As she spoke, she put her hand fondly on his head. It was as wet as a fitted, been dipped in the water. His shirt too was soaked, and as she passed her fingers down his shoulder, she felt a sharp twinge in her heart. For she knew that moisture to be the hard-wrung sweat of severe toil, exacted from her young child. He was but twelve years old, by an unyielding task master. You have worked hard today, my son. I've been mowing. The widow's heart felt another pain. Not all day charlie, she said in a low voice, and there was a slight quiver in it. Yes, mother, all day, replied the boy. Mr. Ellis said he couldn't afford to hire men. For wages is so high. I've swung the Sith ever since an hour before sunrise. Feel of my hands. There were blisters on them like great lumps. Tears started in the widow's eyes. She dared not trust herself with her apply, though her heart was bursting with a thought that she could not better his condition. There was no earthly means of support on which she had dependence enough to encourage her child in the wish she knew is coming. The wish not uttered for the first time to be freed from his bondage. Mother, at length said the boy, I can stand it no longer. I cannot and will not stay at Mr. Ells. Ever since the day I first went into his house, I've been a slave. And if I have to work there much longer, I know I shall run away and go to see or somewhere else. I'd as leave being my grave as there. And the child burst into a passionate fit of weeping. His mother was silent for she was in deep grief herself. After some minutes had flown, however, she gathered sufficient self-possession to speak to her son in a soothing tone, endeavoring to win him from his sorrows and cheer up his heart. She told him that time was swift, that in the course of years he would be his own master, that all people had their troubles, with other ready arguments, which though they had little effect in common her own distress, she hoped would act as a solace on the disturbed temper of the boy. And as the half hour to which he was limited had now elapsed, she took him by the hand and led him to the gate to set forth on his return. The child seemed pacified, though occasionally one of those convulsive sides that remained after a fit of weeping would break from his throat. At the gate he threw his arms about his mother's neck, each pressed a long kiss on the lips of the other, and the youngster bent his steps towards his master's house. As her child passed out of sight, the widow returned shut the gate, and entered her lonesome room. There was no light in the old cottage that night. The heart of its occupant was dark and cheerless. Sora, agony, and grief, and tears, and convulsive wrestlers were there. The thought of a beloved son condemned a labor, labor that would bend down a man, struggling from day to day under the hard rule of a soulless gold worshipper. The knowledge that years must pass thus, the sickening idea of her own poverty, and of living mainly on the grudge charity of neighbors. These racked the widows heart and made her bad as sleepless one. O you who living in plenty in peace, fret at some little misfortune or some trifling disappointment, behold the spectacle and blush at your unmanliness. Little do you know of the dark trials, compared to yours as night-s great veil to a daylight cloud, that are still going on around you. Pangs of hunger, the faintness of the soul at seeing those we love, trampled down, without our having the power to aid them. The wasting away of the body and sickness incurable, and those dull aches of the heart when the consciousness comes upon the poor man's mind, that while he lives he will in all probability live in want and wretchedness. The boy bent his steps to his employers as has been said, in his way down the village street, he had to pass a public house, the only one the place contained, and when he came off against it, he heard the sound of a fiddle, drowned however it intervals by much laughter and talking. The windows were up and the house standing close to the road. Charles thought it no harm to take a look and see what was going on within. Half a dozen footsteps brought him to the low casement on which he leaned his elbow and where he had a full view of the room and its occupants. In one corner was an old man known in the village's black Dave. He was whose musical performances had a moment before drawn Charles's attention to the tavern, and he was who now exerted himself in a most violent manner to give with diverse flourishes and extra twangs, a tune popular among that thick-lipped race whose fondness for melody is so well known. In the middle of the room were five or six sailors, some of them quite drunk, and others in the earlier stages of that process, while on benches around were more sailors, and here in there a person dressed in landsmen's attire, but hardly behind the sea gentleman in a porousness and moth, the individuals in the middle of the room were dancing. That is they were going through search and quotations and shufflings, very decasently by exceedingly hearty stamps upon the sanded floor. In short, the whole party were engaged in a drunken phroleg, which was in no respect different from a thousand other drunken phrolegs. Except perhaps that there was the less than the ordinary amount of anger and quarreling. Indeed, everyone seemed and remarkably good humor, but what excited the boys' attention more than any other object was an individual seated on one of the benches opposite, who though evidently enjoying the spree as much as if he were an old hand at such business, seemed in every other particular to be far out of his element. His appearance was useful. He might have been 21 or 2. His countenance was intelligent and had the air of city life in society. He was dressed not godly, but in all respects fashionably, his coping of the finest black broad cloth, his linen delicate and spotless as snow, and his whole aspect account apart to those which may be nightly seen in the dress circles of our most respectable theatres. He laughed and talked with the rest and it must be confesses jokes like the most of those that passed current there, whereby no means distinguished for their refinement or purity. Near the door was a small table covered with decanters, and with glasses, some of which had been used, but were used again indiscriminately, and a box of very thick and long cigars. Come boys, said one of sailors, taking advantage of a momentary pause in the hub of to rasp his enormous knuckles on the table and call attention to himself. The gentleman in question had but one eye, and two most extensive whiskers. Come boys, let's take a drink. I know you're all a getting dry, so curse me if you shant have a socket my expense. This polite invitation was responded to, by a general moving of the company towards the little table, holding the before mentioned decanters and glasses. Clustering there around, each gentleman helped himself to a very respectable portion of that particular liquor, which suited his fancy, and steadiness and accuracy, being at that time by no means distinguishing traits of the arms and legs of the party, a good-a-lea amount of the fluid was spilled upon the floor. This piece of extravagance excited the eyeer of the person who was treating, and his anger was still further increased when he discovered two or three loiterers, who seemed disposed to slight his civil request to drink. Walk up boys, walk up. Don't let there be any skulkers among us, or blast my eyes if he shanked down on his marrow bones, and gobble up the rum we've spilled. Hello, he exclaimed as he spied Charles, hello, you chapped in the window, come here and take us up. As he spoke, he stepped to the open casement, put his brawny hands under the boys' armpits, and lifted him into the room bodily. There are my lads, he said to his companions, he said, you're not so sure, so one either, he added, as he took a fair view of the boy, who, though not what is called pretty, was fresh and manly looking and large for his age. Come youngster, take a glass, he continued, and he poured one nearly full of strong brandy. Now Charles was not exactly frightened, for he was a lively fellow, and had often been at the country-marrying makings, and with the young men of the place who were very fond of him. He was certainly rather abashed at his abrupt introduction to the midst of strangers. So, putting the glass aside, he looked up with a pleasant smile in his new acquaintances face. I've no need of anything now, he said, but I'm just as much obliged to you as if I was. Poe, man, drink it down, rejoin the sailor, drink it down, and won't hurt you, and by way of showing it's excellence, the one eyed where the drained it himself to the very last drop. Then filling it again, he renewed his hospitable efforts to make the lad go through the same operation. I've no occasion, beside, it makes my headache, and I have promised my mother not to drink any, was the boy's answer. A little irritated by his continued refusals, the sailor with a loud oath, declared that Charles should swallow the brandy whether he would or no. Placing one of his tremendous paws on the back of the boy's head, with the other he thrust the edge of the glass to his lips, swearing at the same time, that if he shook it so as to spill its contents, the consequences would be of a nature by no means agreeable to his back and shoulders. Disliking the liquor and angry at the temp overbear him, the undone to child lifted his hand and struck at the arm of the sailor with a blow so sudden, that the glass fell, and was smashed a piece on the floor, while the liquid was about equally divided between the face of Charles, the close of the sailor, and the sand. This time the whole of the company had their attention drawn to the scene. Some of them laughed when they saw Charles undisguised antipathy to the drink, but they laughed still more hardly when he disconfided the sailor. All of them, however, were content to let the matter go as chance would have it. All but the young man of the black coat, who had before been spoken of. Why was it that from the first of seeing him, the young man's heart had moved with a strange feeling of kindness toward the boy? He felt anxious to know more of him. He felt that he should love him. Oh, it is passing wondrous, how in the hurried walks of life and business, we meet with young beings, strangers, who seem to touch the fountains of our love and draw forth their swelling waters. The wish to love and to be beloved, which the forms of custom and the engrossing anxiety for gains so generally smother. Well, sometimes burst forth and spite of all obstacles, and kindled by one who, till the hour, was unknown to us, will burn with a lovely and appear brightness. No scrap it is this of sentimental fiction, ask your own heart reader and your own memory for endorsement to its truth. Charles stood his cheek flushed and his heart throbbing, wiping the trickling drops from his face for the hangar chiff. At first the sailor, between his drunkenness and his surprise, was pretty much in the condition of one who suddenly awakened out of a deep sleep and cannot call his consciousness about him. When he saw the state of things, however, and heard the gearing laugh of his companions, his dull-eyed lighting up with anger, fell upon the boy who had withstood him. He seized the child with a grip of iron, he bent Charles halfway over and with the side of heavy foot, gave him a sharp and solid kick. He was about repeating the performance for the child hung like a rag in his grasp, but all of a sudden his ears wrung as if pistols had snapped close to them. Lights of various use flickered in his eye. He had but one it must be remembered. And a strong propelling power caused him to move from his position and keep moving until he was brought up by the wall. A blow, a cuff given in such a scientific and effectual manner that the hand from which it came was evidently no stranger to the pubulistic art had been suddenly planted on the ear of the sailor. It was planted by the young stranger of the black coat. He had watched with interest the proceedings of the sailor in the boy, two or three times he was on the point of interfering, but when he witnessed the kick, his rage was uncontrollable. He sprung from his seat like a mad tiger, assuming unconsciously however, the attitude of a boxer. He struck the sailor in a manner to cause those unpleasant sensations just described, and he would probably have followed up his attack and a method by no means consistent with the sailor's personal ease. Had not Charles now thoroughly terrified, clung around his leg, and prevented his advancing. The scene was a strange one and for a moment quite a silent one. The company had started from their seats and held startled but quiet positions. In the middle of the rooms to the young man in his not at all ungraceful posture, every nerve strained and his eyes flashing very brilliantly. He seemed to be rooted like a rock, and clasping him with an appearance of confidence in his protection. Hung the boy. Dare, you scoundrel cried the young man, his voice thick with agitation. Dare to touch this boy again, and I'll batter you till no sense is left in your body. The sailor, now partially recovered, made some gestures from which it might be inferred that he resented this ungential treatment. Come on, Drunken Brute, continued the angry youth. I wish you would, you've not had half what you deserve. Upon sobriety and sense more fully taking their seats and the brains of the one I'd mariner, however, that worthy determined in his own mind that it would be the most prudent to let the matter drop. Expressing therefore his conviction to that effect, adding certain remarks to the purport that he meant no harm to the lad, that he was surprised at such a gentle man getting so up about a little piece of fun, and so forth, he proposed that the company should go on with their jolly, just as if nothing had happened. In truth, he of the single eye was not a bad-hearted fellow. The fiery enemy whose advances he had so often courted that night had stolen away his good feelings, and set busy devils at work within him that might have made his hands do some dreadful deed had not the stranger interfered. In a few minutes the frolic of the party was upon its former footing. The young man sat down on one of the benches with the boy by a side, and while the rest were loudly laughing and talking, they too held communion together. The stranger learned from trials all the particulars of his simple story. I was father and guide year since, as mother had worked hard for a bear living, and how he himself for many jury months had been the bond child of a hard-hearted, avaricious master. More and more interested, drawing the child close to his side, the young man listened to his plainly told history, and thus an hour passed away. It was now past midnight. The young man told Charles that on the morrow, he would take steps to have him liberated from his servitude. For the present night he said, it would perhaps be best for the boy to stay and shares bet at the end. And little persuading did the child need to do so. As they retired to sleep, very pleasant thoughts filled the mind of the young man, thoughts of a worthy action performed, a vancelled affection, thoughts too newly awakened ones, of walking in a steadier and wiser path than formerly. All he is imagining seemed to be interwoven with the youth who lay by his side. He folded his arms around him, and while he slept, the boys cheek rested on his bosom. Fair were those two creatures in their unconscious beauty. Glorious, but yet how differently glorious, one of them was innocent and sinless of all wrong, the other, oh, to that other, what evil had not been present, either in action or taste desires. Who was the stranger? To those who, from ties of relationship or otherwise, felt an interest in him, the answer to such a question was not a pleasant theme to dwell upon. His name was Langton, parentless, a dissipated young man, a brawler, one whose two frequent companions were rowdy's black legs and swindlers. The New York police officers were not altogether strangers to his countenance, and certain reporters who note the transactions there, had more than once received gratuities for leaving out his name, from the disgraceful notoriety of their columns. He had been bred to the profession of medicine. Beside that, he had a very respectable income, and his house was in a pleasant street on the west side of the city. Little of his timehover did Mr. John Lankton spend at his domestic herphe, and the elderly lady who officiated his housekeeper was by no means surprised to have him gone for a week or a month at a time, and she knowing nothing of his whereabouts. Living as he did, the young man was on an unhappy being. It was not so much that his associates were below his own capacity for Langton, though sensible and well-bred, was by no means talent here refined, but that he lived without any steady purpose, that he had no one to attract him to his home, that he too easily allowed himself to be tempted, which caused his life to be of late one continued scene of dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction he sought to drive away, ah, fool-ish youth, by mixing in all kinds of parties and places where the object was pleasure. On the present occasion he had left the city a few days before, and was passing the time at a place near the village, where Charles and his mother live. He had that day fallen in with those who were his companions in the tavern's free, and thus it happened that they were all together. For Langton hesitated not to make himself at home with any associates, that suited his fancy. The next morning the poor widow rose from her sleepless cot, and from that lucky trait in our nature which makes one extreme follow another, she set about her daily toil with a light in heart. Ellis the farmer rose to, short as the nights were, an hour before day, for his god was gain, and a prim article of his creed was to get as much work as possible from everyone around him. He roused up all his people, and finding that Charles had not been home the preceding night, he muttered threats against him, and calling a messenger to whom he hinted that any minutes which he stayed, beyond a most exceedingly short period, would be subtracted from his breakfast time, dispatched him to the widows to find what was her son about. What was he about? With one of the brightest and earliest rays of the warm sun, a gentle angel entered his apartment, and hovering over the sleepers on invisible wings, looked down with a pleasant smile and blessed them. Then, noiselessly taking a stamp by the bed, the angel bent over the voice face, and whispered strange words into his ear. Thus it came that he had beautiful visions. No sound was heard, but the slight breathing of those who slumbered there in each other's arms, and the angel paused a moment, and smiled another, and a doubly sweet smile as he drank in the scene, with his large soft eyes. Bending over again to the voice lips, he touched them with a kiss, as the language wind touches a flower. He seemed to be going now, and yet he lingered. Tricer thrice he bent over the brow of the young man, and went not. Now the angel was troubled, for he would have pressed the young man's forehead with a kiss, as he did the child's, but a spirit from the pure country, who touches anything tainted by evil thoughts, does it at the risk of having his breast pierced with pain, as with a barbed arrow? At that moment a very pale bright ray of sunlight darted through the window, and settled on the young man's features. Then the beautiful spirit knew that permission was granted him, so he softly touched the young man's face with his, and silently and swiftly wafted himself away on the unseen air. In the course of the day, Ellis was called upon by young LinkedIn, and never perhaps in his life with the farmer more puzzled, than at the young man's proposals, his desire to provide for a boy who could do him no peculiarly good, and his willingness to disperse money for that purpose. In that department of Ellis' structure where the mind was, or ought to have been situated, they're never had entered the slightest thought, assimilating to those, which actuated the young man in his proceedings in this business. Yet Ellis was a church member, and a county officer. The widow too was called upon, not only that day, but the next and the next. It needs not to particularly rise the subsequent events of lengthens and the boy's history, how the reformation of the prophylgate might be dated to begin from that time, how he gradually severed the guilty ties that had so long galled him, how he enjoyed his own home, and loved to be there, and why he loved to be there, how the close-knit love of the boy and him grew not slack with time, and how when it lengthy became head of a family of his own, he would shudder when he thought of his early danger and escape.

Post-Mortem, essays, historical and medical by Charles McLaren. Whether the great man has had any real influence on the world or whether history is merely a matter of ideas and tendencies among mankind, or still questions open to solution. But there is no doubt that great persons are still interesting, and it is the aim of this series of essays to throw such light upon them as as possible as regards their physical condition and to consider how far their actions are influenced by their health. There are many remarkable people in history about whom we know too little to dogmatize, though we may strongly suspect that their mental and physical conditions were abnormal when they would live to take actions which have passed into history. For instance, is Mahatma and Saint Paul. Much I have purposely omitted, but there are far more whose actions were clearly the result of their state of health. And some of these who happen to have been leaders at critical epochs, I have ventured to study from the point of view of a doctor. This point of view appears to have been strangely neglected by historians and others. With the background against which it shows as heroes and heroines should appear on sentimental and harsh, at least it appears to medical opinion as probably true, and it is our duty to seek truth. If it appears to assume an iconoclastic attitude towards many ideals, I am sorry, and can only wish that the patina cast upon their characters were more sentimental and beautiful. John Dark and Emperor Charles V were undoubtedly heroic figures who have been almost worshiped by many millions of people. Yet undoubtedly they were human and subject to the unhappy frailtys of other people. This in no way detracts from their renown. I must apologize for treating donkey hote as a real person. He was quite as much of living individual as anyone in history. Through his glamour we can get a real glimpse of the character of servantes. In Australia we have no access to the original sources of European history. We must rely upon the printed word as it appears in standard monographs and essays. I owe many thanks to Miss Kibble of the Research Department of the Sydney Public Library without whose help this work would never have been undertaken.

Doys he lived in the midst of the great Candace Purries, with some go Henry, who is a farmer, and an M, who is the farmer's wife. No house was small, for the longer to build it had be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor, anamoof, which made one room, and this room contained a vastly looking cook stove, a covered for dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and a bed. Ogre Henry and an M had one big bed in the corner, and Doys he had a little bag in the other room. There was no Garrett at all, and no salad. It kept a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone salad, with a family to go in case one of the great whirlwinds, mighty enough to crush any building in a path. It was reached by a tractor in the middle of floor, from which a ladder went down to a small dark hole. When Doys he stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great, great prairie on every side. No tree nor house booked a broad sweep at a flat country that reached the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a grain mass, with some cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, but the sun had burned at top to the long blades, until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered at paints and the rains were washed away, and now the house was a dull and gray as everything else. When on M came to live there, she was a young, pretty wife, the sun and when had changed her too. They had taken the sparkle from the eyes and left them a silver gray. They had taken the red with cheeks and lips. They were gray also. She was sin and gant, a never smiled now. When Doys he, who was an orphan, first came to her, on M had been so starved by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Doys is very voice reached part of years. She still looked at the world of girls wondering that she could find anything in the laugh at. Oca Henry never laughed. He worked hard for a morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, when this long beer to his buff boots, and he looked stern and solemn and really spoke. It was Todo that made Doys he laughed and saved him from becoming as gray all of his surroundings. Todo was not gray. He was a little black dogs long still be here and small black eyes that turned close to Mary and he decided to be funny. We know Todo played all day long and Doys he played with him and loved him due. Today however, they were not playing. Onca Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even greater than usual. Doys he stood in the door with Todo and arms and looked to the sky too. On M was watching dishes. From afar, no, I say her a low whale was a bit and onca Henry and Doys he could see the long glass bow into his before coming the storm. The sharp wistening ears in the south. As the eyes turned that way to saw ripples in the glass coming from that direction also. Suddenly, Oca Henry stood up. He called to his wife. He went towards the shed and looked at the clouds. On M dropped to work and came to Doys. One glass took the danger close to the hand. Like, you see, she screamed. Landed for the feather. Todo jumped out of Doys he's on and he'd under the bed. The little girl started to get him. On M badly fighting, swore of an trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hall. Doys he caught Todo at last and stood far hung. When she was halfway across the room, they came and went straight from the wind and how shook so hard that she was to foot and suddenly sat down upon the floor. Then a strange thing happened. The house world, two or three times around, and will slowly severe, Doys he felt as she was going up in a balloon. The noise in the south and met with a house stood in. And made it the exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of the cyclone, the air is generally still. But the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone. They were mailed and was carried miles and miles away. And easily as you could carry a feather. It was very dark and the wind held terribly around it. Doys he found she was riding quite easily. After the first few rules around and one other time when the house took badly, she thought as she was being rocked, gently like a baby in a cradle. Toto did not like it. He ran about the room. Now here, now there, bucking loudly. But Doys he said, quiet, still on the floor and laid to see what would happen. Once Toto got two years to the open tractor and fell in at first the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of the ears digging up the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping it up so that he could not fall. She kept it to the hole, cut toward the mighty air, dragged him into the room again. Afterward, close in the tractor, there was no more incidents could happen. Our after hour passed away and slowly Doys he got over the fight. But she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly around it that she nearly became deaf. At first she had worried if she would be dashed to pieces on the house fell again. But as the hour passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wake home with the sea water the future would bring. Unless she crawled over the swing floor to a bed and laid down upon it and Toto followed and laid down the signer. Inspired of the swing in house and the wailing at a wind, Doys he seemed close to eyes and fell down the sleep. End of chapter 1",Children's Fiction,English,03:47:07,T.

QRM-Interplanetary,George O. Smith,67604,4.0,"May 25, 2022",[],0,".org. QRM Interplanetary by George O. Smith. Part 1 QRM International Coat Signal Meaning Interference of Controlable Nature, such as manmade static, cross modulation from another channel adjoining, or willful obliteration of signals by an interfering source. Interference not of natural sources, designated by international code as QRN, such as electrical storms, common static, etc. Handbook, Interplanetary Amateur Radio League. Corvus The Magnificent, Nila Moe of Yorailin, picked up the telephone in his palace and said, I want to talk to Will Neda. He is at the International Hotel in Detroit, Michigan. I'm sorry sir, came the voice of the operator. Talking is not possible due to the 15 minute transmission lag between here and Terra. Interplanetary communications will not permit audio. However, Teletype messages are welcome. Her voice originated 1500 miles north of Yorailin, but it sounded as though she might be in the next room. Corvus thought for a moment and then said, Take this message. Will Neda, add to order for mining machinery one type 56XXD flyer to replace washed out model. And remember, tobacco and sub-level energy will not mix. Sign that Corvus. Yes, Mr. Corvus. Not Mr. Yildamonark. I am Corvus the Magnificent. I am Nila Moe of Yorailin. Yes, your magnificence. Said the operator humbly. It was more than possible that she was stifling a laugh, which knowledge made the little man of Venus squirm in wrath. But there was nothing that he could do about it. Television still being distant by the same five years that it was behind in 1929. To give Corvus credit, he was not a pompous little man. He was large, for a Venetian, which made him small according to the standards set up by terrestrients. He, as Nila Moe of Yorailin, had extended the once small kingdom outward to include most of the Pelinoridus country, which extended from about 23 degrees north latitude to 61.70 degrees, and almost across the whole single continent that was the dry land of Venus. He was a wily monarch, making his conquest of the wild and lawless country by treaty, and by doubled double crossing those who might have tried to double cross him. Armed conquest was scorned, but armed defense was desirable in the Pelinoridus country, and Corvus had defended himself up and down the inhabitable northern portion of the planet. His conquest had been a blessing to civilisation, and they'll publicly denounced, it was privately commended. Those who could have stopped it, did all they could to delay and intercept any proceedings that would have caused the conquest of Corvus intended in country any trouble. Corvus message to Terra zoomed across the 1500 rocky miles of Pelinoridus to northern landing. It passed high across the 1000 foot high trees and over the mountain ranges. It swept over open patches of water and across intervening cities and towns. It went with the speed of light and an a tight beam from Yorailin to northern landing, straight as a die and with person to person clarity. The operation in the city that lay across the north pole of Venus clicked on a teletype, reading back the message as it was written. Corvus told him, that is correct. The message will be in the hands of your representative willnada within the hour. The punch tape from operator number 7's machines slid along the line. It entered a coupling machine and was stripped from the tape and repunched upon a tape that was operating at better than a thousand words per minute. Operator 7's tape then left the machine to be rolled into a fire roll and placed in the vaults below the city. It was of no use save as a reference from now on. The coupling machine worked furiously. It accepted the tapes from 70 operators as fast as they could write them. It selected the messages as they enter the machine, placing on mechanical preference upon whichever message happened to be ahead of the others on the moving tapes. The master tape moved continuously at 1100 words per minute, taking teletype messages from everywhere in the northern hemisphere of Venus to any of the other planets in the solar system. It was a busy machine for even at 1100 words per minute, it often got hours behind. The synchronous key signal from the coupling machine left the operating room and went to the transmission room. It was amplified and hurled out of the city to a small squat building at the outskirts of northern landing. Here it was impressed upon a carrier wave and flung at the sky. But not alone, not unguarded. The upper half of the building carried a monstrous parabolic reflector mounted on gimbals. The signal was focused into a beam. The beam was made of two components. The center component was a circuitally polarized ultra-high frequency wave of five centimeter waves, modulated with the king signals of the teletype coupling machine. The outer component was a radially polarized wave of one centimeter waves, a radio frequency armor. It was hurled at the sky a concentric wave out of a reflector by a thousand kilowatt transmitter. The wave seared against the Venution heavy side layer. The outer component board at the ionization. It chewed and it bit. It fought and it struggled. It destroyed ionization by electronically shorting the ionization. And as is the case with strife, it lost heavily in the encounter. The beam was resisted fiercely. In filtrations of ionization toward the central component, stripping and trying to beat it down. But man triumphed over nature. The megawatt of energy that came in a tight beam from the building at northern landing emerged from the heavy side layer as a weak pifling signal. It wavered and it crackled. It wanted desperately to lie down and sleep. It's directional qualities were impaired and it wobbled badly. It arrived at the relay station and tired and worn. One million watts of ultra-high frequency energy at the start, it was measurable in microvolts when it reached the relay station, only 500 miles above the city of northern landing. The signal as weak and as wobbly as it was was taken in by eager receptors. It was amplified. It was de-hashed, destatic and deloused. And once again, 100 decibels stronger and infinitely clearer, the signal was hurled out on a tight beam from a gigantic parabolic reflector. Across 67 million miles of space went the signal. Across the orbit of Venus it went in a vast cord. It arrived at the Venus Equalateral Station with less troubled than the original transmission to the heavy side layer. The signal was amplified and demodulated. It went into a decouper machine where the messages were sorted mechanically and sent each to the proper channel into other coupler machines. Beams from Venus Equalateral were directed at Mars and Atara. The Tara beam ended at Luna. Here it again was placed in the two component beam and from Luna it punched down at Tara's layer. It emerged into the atmosphere of Tara as weak and as tired as it had been when it had come out of the Venus layer. It entered a station in the Bahamas was stripped of the interference and put upon the land beams. It entered decoupling machines that sort of the messages as to destination. These various beams spread out across the face of Tara, the one carrying Corvus message finally coming into a station at 10 mile road in Woodward. From this station at the outskirts of Detroit it went upon land wires downtown to the International Hotel. The Teletype machine in the office of the hotel began to click rapidly. The message to Will Nader was arriving. At 55 minutes after the operator told Corvus that less than an hour would ensue. Will Nader was saying humorously, so Corvus was drunk again last night. Completion of Corvus message to Will Nader completes also one phase of the tail at hand. It is not important. There were 150 other messages that might have been accompanied in the same manner. Each has interesting to the person who likes the explanation of the interplanetary communication service. But this is not a technical journal. A more complete explanation of the various phases that a message goes through in leaving a city on Venus to go to Tara may be found in the communications technical review, volume 27, number 8, pages 411 to 716. Readers more interested in the technical aspects are referred to the article. But it so happens that Corvus message was picked out of 100 odd messages because of one thing only. At the time that Corvus message was in transit through the decouper machines at Venus equilateral relay station, something of a material nature was entering the airlock of the station. It was an unexpected visit. Don Channing looked up at the indicator panel in his office and frowned in puzzlement. He punched a buzzer and spoke into the communicator on his desk. Find out who that is when you are didn't? He isn't expected. Came back the voice of Arden Westland. I know that, but I've been expecting someone ever since John Walters retired last week. You know why. You hope to get his job said the girl in an amused voice. I hope you do. So that someone else will sit around all day trying to make you retire so that he can have your job. Now look Arden, I've never tried to make Walters retire. No, but when the word came that he was thinking of it, you began to think about taking over. Don't worry, I don't blame you. There was quite a protracted silence and then her voice returned. The visitor is a gentleman by the name of Francis Burbank. He came out in a flitter with a chauffeur in all. Big shot, hey. Take it easy. He's coming up to the office now. I gather that he desires audience with me. Asked on. I think that he's here to lay down the law. You'll have to get out of Walters office if his appearance is any guide. There was some more silence. The communicator was turned off at the other end, which made Channing fume. He would have preferred to hear the interchange of words between his secretary and the newcomer. Then instead of having the man announced, the door opened abruptly and the stranger entered. He came to the point immediately. Here are Don Channing, acting director of interplanetary communications. I am. Then I have some news for you, Dr Channing. I have been appointed director by the interplanetary communications commission. You are to resume your position as electronics engineer. Oh, said Channing, his face fell. I sort of believe that I would be offered that position. There was a discussion of that procedure. However, the commission decided that a man of more commercial training would better fill the position. The communications division has been operating at too small a profit. They felt that a man of commercial experience could cut expenses and so on to good effect. You understand their reasoning, of course, said Burbank. Not exactly. Well, it is like this. They know that a scientist is not usually a man to consider the cost of experimentation. They built thousand-ton cyclotrons to convert a penny's worth of lead into one-and-one-tence sense worth of lead and gold. And they used $300 worth of power and a million-dollar machine to do it with. They feel that a man with training like that will not know the real meaning of the phrase cutting expenses. A new broom sweeps clean, Dr. Channing. There must be many places where a man of commercial experience can cut expenses. I, as director, shall do so. I wish you luck, said Channing. Then, there is no hard feeling? I can't say that. It is probably not your fault. I cannot feel against you, but I do feel sort of let down at the decision of the commission. I have had experience in this job. The commission may appoint you to follow me. If your work shows a grasp of commercial operations, I shall so recommend. Thanks, said Channing, Dr. Lee. May I buy you a drink? I never drink. And I do not believe in it. If it were mine to say, I prohibit liquor from the premises. Venus equal at all would be better off without it. Don Channing snapped the communicator. Miss Westlin, will you come in? She entered Puzzleman on her face. This is Mr. Burbank. His position places him in control of this office. You will in the future report to him directly. The report on the operations and generic projects and so on that I was to send into the commission this morning will therefore be placed in Mr. Burbank's hands as soon as possible. The yes, Dr. Channing, her eyes held a twinkle, but there was concern and sympathy in them too. Shall I get them immediately? They are ready. I was about to put them on the tape when you called. Then give them to Mr. Burbank. Channing turned to Burbank. Miss Westlin will hand you the reports I mentioned. They are complete and precise. A Parus love them will put you in grasp of a situation here at Venus equilateral better than will in all afternoon conference. I'll have Miss Westlin hauled any junk out of here. You may consider this as your office. It having been used by Walters. And in the meantime, I've got to check up on some experiments down on the ninth level. Channing paused. You'll excuse me? Yes, if Miss Westlin knows where to find you, she will. I'll inform her of my whereabouts. I may want to consult you after I read the reports. That will be all right. The autocor can find me anywhere on Venus equilateral if I'm not at the place Miss Westlin calls. Don Channing stopped at Arden's desk. I'm booted, he told her. Leaving Venus equilateral, she asked with concern. No, blonde and beautiful. I'm just shunned it back to my own office. Can't I go with you? pleaded the girl. Nope. You were to stay here and be a nice, good-looking, muttahari. This bird seems to think that he can run interplanetary communications like a bus or a factory. I know the type and the first thing he'll do is to run interplanetary communications into a snarl. Keep me informed of anything complicated, will you? Sure. And where are you going now? I'm going down and get Wolf Franks. We're going to inspect the transparency of a new type of glass. I didn't know that optical investigations came under your jurisdiction. This investigation will consist of a visit to the ninth level. Can't you take me along? Not today, be grinned. Your new boss does not believe in the evils of looking through the bottom of a glass. We must behave with decor. We must forget fun. We are now operating under a man who will commercialize electronics to a fine art. Don't get stued. He may want to know where the electrons are kept. I'm not going to drink that much. Walt and I need a discussion, be said. And in the meantime, hall my spinach out of the office, will you? And take it back to the electronics office. I'll be needing it back there. Okay, Don. She said. I'll see you later. Chanting left to go to the ninth level. He stopped long enough to collect Walt Franks. Over a tall glass of beer, chanting told Franks of Burbank's visit. And why? Only one thing stuck in Frank's mind. Did you say that he might close Joe's asked Franks? He said that if it were in his power to do so, he would. Heaven forbid, where will we go to be alone? Hull-hone, snorted chanting. The bar was half filled with people, being the only drinking establishment for 60 odd million miles. Well, you know what I mean. I could smuggle in a few cases of beer, suggest it done. Could we smuggle him out? That would be desirable, but I think he is here to stay. Don at all. Why do they have to appoint some confounded political pal to a job like this? I'm telling you Walt, he must wait 200 if he weighs a pound. He holds a stomach on his lap when he sits down. Walt looked up and down, chanting slender figure. Well, he will behold a whistling on his lap if it is filled with stomach. I never hold whistling on my lap. No. During working hours, finished chanting. He grinned at Franks and ordered another beer. And how is the office of beam control going to make out under the new regime? I'll answer that after I see how the new regime treats the office of beam control. Answered Franks. I doubt that he could do much to bugger things up in my office. There aren't many cheaper ways to direct a beam, you know. Yeah, you're safe. But what I can't understand is why they didn't continue you in that job. You've been handling the business ever since last December when Waltors got sick. You've been doing all right? Doing all right just means that I've been carrying over Walter's methods and ideas. What the commission once apparently is something new. Ergo, the new broom. Personally, I like that one about the old shoes being more comfortable, said Franks. If you say the word done, I'll slip a madosa high voltage. That should fix him. I think the better way would be to work for the bird. Then when he goes, I'll have his recommendation. Food, food, snorted Franks. They'll just appoint another political pal. They've tried it before and they'll try it again. I wonder what precinct he carries. The telephone rang in the bar and the bartender, after answering, motion to Walt Franks. You're what it in your office, said the bartender. Emphasize, he told Channing, if I'm going to get lunch for 3,000 people, you'd better try it along too. It's nearly 11 o'clock, you know, and the first batch of 500 will be coming in. He wasn't quite accurate as to the figures. The compliment of Venus Equalateral was just shy of 2,700. They worked in 3-8 hours shifts, about 900 to a shift. They had their lunch and dinner hour staggered, so that at no time was there more than about 200 people in the big lunch room. The bar, it may be mentioned, was in a smaller room at one end of the much larger cafeteria. Venus Equalateral Relay Station was a modern miracle of engineering, if you'd like to believe the books. Actually, Venus Equalateral was an asteroid that had been shoved into its orbit about the sun, forming a practical demonstration of the Equalateral Triangle solution of the three moving bodies. It was a long cylinder, about 3 miles in length by about a mile in diameter. There was little of the original asteroid. At the present time, most of the original rock had been discarded to make room for the ever-growing personnel and material that were needed to operate through relay station. What had been an asteroid with machinery was now a huge pile of machinery with people. The insides, formerly of spongy rock, were now neatly cubed off into offices, rooms, hallways, and so on, divided by sheets of steel. The outer surface, once rugged and forbidding, was now almost all shiny steel. The small asteroid, a tiny thing, was far smaller than the present relay station. The station having overflowed the asteroid soon after men found that on-interrupted communication was possible between the worlds. Now, the man made asteroid carried 2700 people. There were stores, offices, places of recreation, churches, marriages, deaths, and everything but taxes. Judging by its population, it was a small town. Venus equilateral rotated about its axis. On the inner surface of the shell, were the homes of the people, not cottages, but apartment cubicles, one, two, three, six rooms. The rotation made a little more than one earth-g of artificial gravity. Above this outer shell of apartments, the offices began, offices, recreation centers, and so on. Up in the central portion where the gravity was nil or near-nil, the automatic machinery was placed. The gyroscopes and the beamfinders, the storerooms, the air plants, the hydroponic farms, and all other things that needed little or no gravity for well-being. This was the Venus equilateral relay station, 60 degrees ahead of the planet Venus on Venus orbit. Often closer to terror than Venus, the relay station offered a perfect place to relay messages through whenever Mars or terror were on the other side of the sun. It was seldom idle. For it was seldom that both Mars and terror were in such position that direct communication between the three planets was possible. This was the center of inner planetary communications. This was the main office. It was the heart of the system's communication line, and as such it was well-maned. Orders were everything emanated from Venus equilateral. It was a delicate proposition. Venus equilateral was, and hence the present on all occasions official capacities and office staff. This was the organization that Dawn Channing hoped to direct. A closed corporation with one purpose in mind, interplanetary communication. Channing wondered if this summons for Walt Franks was an official one, returning to the electronics office, Dawn punched the communicator and asked, is Walt in there? Art and his voice came back. No, but Burbank is in Frank's office. One of listen. Eavesdropper, using the communicator? Sure. Better shut it off. Warn Dawn. Burbank isn't foolish, you know, and there are pilot lights and warning flags on those things to tell if someone has the key open. I wouldn't want to see you fired for listening in. All right, but it was getting interesting. If I'm betting on the right horse, said Channing, this will be interesting for all before it is finished. Seven days went by and monotonous procession. Seven days in a world of constant climate. One week marked only by the changing of work shifts and the clocks that marked off the eight-hour periods. Seven days on mark by rain or cold or heat. Seven days of uninterrupted sunshine that flickered in and out of the sealed viewports with eye-seering brilliance, coming and going as the station rotated. But in the front offices, things were not as serene. No, but not in need to become Erxom. Not that monotony ever said in seriously in the engineering department, but that sacred sanctum of all things that didn't behave as they should found that even their usual turmoil was worse. There was nothing that a person could set his finger on directly. It was more of a quiet, undercover nature. On Monday, Burbank sent around a community removing the option of free messages for the personnel. On Tuesday, he reminded the years long custom of permitting the supply ships to carry free packages from friends at home. On Wednesday, Francis Burbank decided that there should be a curfew on the one and only beer-emporion. That was made after he found that curtailing all sorts of alcoholics might easily lead to a more moral problem, there being little enough to do with one spare time. On Thursday, he set up a stiff neckstaff of sensors for the movie Picture House. On Friday, he put a tax on cigarettes and candy. On Saturday, he installed time clocks in all the laboratories and professional offices, where previous two is coming, mid-hit come for work a half-hour late and worked an hour over time at night. On Sunday, he ran into trouble. Don Channies stormed into the director's office with a scowl on his face. Look, he said, for years and years, we have felt that any man, woman or child that was willing to come out here, was worth all the freedom and consideration that we could give them. What about this damn tax on cigarettes and candy? And who told you to stop our folks from telling their folks that they're still in good health? And why stop them from sending packages of candy? Cake, Mementos, clothing, soap, mosquito dope, liquor or anything else? Why shut up our beer half-da-day? Did you ever think that a curfew is something that can be applied only when time is one in the same for all? On Venus Equilateral Mr. Burbank, six o'clock in the evening, is two hours after dinner for one group, two hours after going to work for the second group, and mid-sleep for the third. Then this matter of cutting all love scenes, drinking, female vampires, banditry, bedroom items, murders, and sweater girls out of the movies? We are a selected group, and will prepare to take care of our morality. Any man or woman going off-site would be heaved out quick. Why, after years of personal freedom, do we find ourselves under the authority of a veritable dictatorship? Francis Burbank was not touched. I'll trouble you to keep to your own laboratory, Petal Channing. Perhaps your own laxity in matters of this sort is the reason why the commission preferred someone better prepared. You speak of many things. There will be more to come. I'll answer some of your questions. Why should we permit our profits to be eaten up by people sending messages, cost free to their acquaintances all over the minor planets? Why should valuable space for valuable supplies be taken up with personal favors between friends? And if the person now wants to smoke and drink, let them pay for the privilege. It will help to pay for the high price of shipping the useless items out from the nearest planet, as well as saving of precious storage space. But your breeding ill will among the employees objected Channing. Any that preferred to do so may leave snapped Burbank. You may find it difficult to hire people to spend their lives in a place that offers no side of a sky or a breath of fresh air. The people here may go home to their own planets to find that the smell of fresh spring air is more desirable than a climate that never varies from the personal optimum. I wonder occasionally if it might not be possible to instigate some sort of cold snap or a rainy season, just for the purpose of bringing to the members of Vincico-Alderol, some of the surprises that are to be found in Chicago or New York. Hell, even Kenna Lappalus has an occasional rainstorm. Return to your laboratory, said Burbank coldly, and let me run the station. Why should we spend useless money to pamper people? I don't care if Kenna Lappalus does have an occasional storm. We are not on Mars. We are in Venus, equilateral. You tend to your end of the business and I'll do as I deem fitting for the station. Chanting mentally through up his hands and literally stalked out of the office. Here was a close-knit organization being shot full of holes by a screwball. He stamped down to the night level and beat upon the closed door of Joe's. The door remained closed. Chanting beat with his knuckles until they bled. Finally, a door popped open down the hallway 50 yards and a man looked out. He's head popped in again, and within 30 seconds the door to Joe's open and admitted chaining. Joe slapped the door shut behind chaining quickly. What in how are you doing Joe? A speak easy? The next time you went in, Joe informed him, knock on 902 twice, 914 once, and then here four times. We'll let you in, and now don't say anything too loud. He put a finger to his lips and winked broadly. Even the walls listen. He said in a stage whisper. He led chaining into the room and put on the light. There was a flurry of people who tried to hide their glasses under the table. Never mind, call Joe, it's only Dr. Channing. The room relaxed. I went something stiff, chaining told Joe. I've just gone three rounds with his nibs and came out cold. Some people within earshot asked about it. Channing explained what had transpired. The people seemed satisfied that Channing had done his best for them. The room relaxed into routine. The signal knock came on the door and was open to admit walled Franks and Arden Westland. Franks looked as though he had been given a stiff workout in a cement mixer. Scotch said Arden, and a glass of brew for the lady. What happened to him? He's been trying to keep to Burbank's latest suggestions. You've been working too hard, chaining chided him gently. This is the wrong time to mention that I suppose, but did that beam slipage have anything to do with your condition or was it vice versa? You know that I haven't anything to do with the beam controls personally, said Franks. He straightened up and faced chaining defiantly. Don't get mad. What was it? Master mind up there, called me in to see if there was so manner or means of tightening the beam. I told him sure, we could hold the beam to practically nothing. He asked me why we didn't hold the beam to a parallel and save the dispersed power. He claimed that we could reduce power by two to one if more of it came into the station instead of being smeared all over the firmament. I foolishly agreed with him. He's right, you could. But only if everything is immobilized. I've been trying to work out some means of controlling the beam magnetically so that it would compensate for the normal variations due to magnetic influences. So far, I failed. It can't be done. I know because I worked on the problem for three years with some of the best brains in the system. To date, it is impossible. A click attracted their attention. It was the pneumatic tube, a cylinder dropped out of a tube and Joe opened it and handed the enclosed paper to Franks. He read, Walt, I'm sending this to you and Joe's because I know that is where you are and I think that you should get this real quick. Helen S. Walt smiled weirdly and said, a good secretary, he was a thing of beauty. A thing of beauty is admired and is a joy forever. Helen is both. She is a jewel. Yeah, we know. What does the letter say? It's another communicator from our doading boss. He is removing from my control the odd 300 men. I've got working on beam control. He is to assume the responsibility for them himself. I'm practically out of a job. Make that two scotches, chanting told Joe. Make it three, chimed in Arden. I've got to work for him too. Is that so bad? As chanting, all you've got to do is listen carefully and do as you're told. We have to answer to the bird too. Yeah, said Arden, but you fellows don't have to listen to a dopy guy ask Foolish questions all day. It's driving me silly. Would I like to know, murmured Franks, is what is the idea of pulling me off the job? Nuts, I've been on beam control for years. I've got the finest crew of men anywhere. They can actually force sea of shift and compensate for it, I think. I've picked up myself and I've been proud of my outfit. Now, he said, brokenly, I've got no outfit. In fact, I've darned little crew left at all. Only my dozen lab members. I'll have to go back to swinging a meter myself before this is over. It was quite a come down. From the master of over 300 Heidi Pade, Heidi Prize intelligence technicians, Walt Franks was now the superintendent of one dozen laboratory technicians. It was a definite cut in his status with communications. Shending finished his drink and seeing that Frank's attention was elsewhere. He told Arden, thanks for taking care of him, but don't use all your sympathy on him. I feel that I'm good and need your shoulder to cry on before long. Anytime you want to soft shoulder, said Arden generously, let me know. I'll come running. Shending went out. He roamed nervously all the rest of the day. He visited the bar several times, but the general air of the place depressed him. From a place of recreation, laughter and pleasure, Joe's place had changed to a room for reminiscences and remorse. A place to drown was troubles, or poison them, or to preserve them in alcohol. He went to see the local moving picture. A piece advertised as being one of the best mystery thriller since Demil. He found that all of the interesting parts were cut out, and that the only thing that remained was a rather disjointed portrayal of a poorly detective, finding meaningless clues and ultimately the criminal. There was a suggestion at the end that the detective and the criminal had fought it out, but whether it was with pistols, field pieces, knives, cream puffs, or words, was left up to the imagination. It was also to be assumed that he and the heroine, who went into a partial blackout every time she sat down, finally got acquainted enough to hold hands after the picture. Shending stormed out of the theater after seeing the above, and finding that the only cartoon had been barred, because it showed an innocuous cow without benefit of shorts.

Edited by Sidney Yor Smith, Bertram Stevens and Seeloy Jones published by Angus and Robertson Limited, 89 Castle Ray Street, Sidney, 1917. 1,250 copies of this edition have been printed. Forward The cordial reception of the first number of Arthunostralia by the press on the public justifies as in the belief that a publication of this kind was wanted. It seems to have been generally recognized that Arthunostralia will benefit by the circulation of a journal devoted to Australian work and reproducing its well. Our first number was printed in difficult circumstances during the cold strike. Nevertheless, the quality of the publication received high praise from Arthus and others competent to judge and we are encouraged to go on. We were also very pleased to receive a letter from Mr. Howard Hinton of Sidney stating that the article in Art in Australia on the Hilda exhibition had induced him to present to the New South Wales National Gallery, a collection of 12 watercolors by JJ Hilda. Not only is each of these a charming example of Hilda's art, but the panel represents the whole course of his development from 1907 to 1916. This was not the first of Mr. Hinton's gifts to the New South Wales Gallery, which has not hitherto benefited much by private donations. One friendly critic suggested that we should have included the older and better known Australian artists before young men. Where is Lambert? What about Ford Patterson, Maccubbin, withers Davis, Phillips Fox and the rest? Our idea, however, was not to make this a chronological record of Australian art, nor to begin with all the stars of first magnitude, but to represent the earlier and younger artists concurrently. In time, we hope to cover the whole field of artistic efforts in Australia that is worth the tension. We might mention that without the support of our advertisers, we could not publish at all, while the cost of production is at the present high rate. It is hardly necessary to say that we do not represent any school or society, and are concerned only with the work done by anyone in Australia that is of sufficient artistic merit. We shall be glad to consider short articles on subjects of interest for local artists or art lovers. All communications should be addressed to the editors, Art in Australia, 24 Bonstreet, Sydney.

I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes a fondoseckum morning after Christmas with the intention of wishing him the complements of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown, a pipe rack within his reach upon the right and a part of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very citty and disreputable hard felt hat, much the worst for wear and cracked in several places. Allens and the false sets lying upon the seats of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination. You are engaged, said I, perhaps I interrupt you, not at all, and led to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one he justice some in a direction of the old hat, but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction. As she did myself in his armchair and wore my hands before the crackling fire, for a sharp frosted set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. I suppose I remarked that homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it, that it is a clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime. No, no crime, such Sherlock Holmes, nothing. Only one of those whimsical, little incidents that will happen when you have 4 million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. A mid-deaction and reaction of so dense as form of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience with such so much so I remarked that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime. Precisely, you are due to my attempt to recovery Irene Adela Papers to the singular case of Mary Sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted hip while I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissioner? Yes, it is to him that this trophy belongs. It is his hat. No, no, he found it. His owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it, not as a battered Billy Cot, but as an intellectual problem. And first, as to how it came here, it arrived upon Christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is, I had no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire. The fact of these, about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, is returning from some small qualification was making his way homewood down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him, he saw, in the gaslight, a tourist man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached a corner, good sweet, a railroaded out between this stranger and a little not of rust. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head, smashed the shot window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants, but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an official looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels and vanished amid the lab brins of small streets, which lighted back a Tottenham Court Road. The rusted also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the sports of victory in the shape of this batted hat, and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose. We surely he restored to their owner. My dear fellow, their lives the problem, it is true that, for Mrs. Henry Baker, with printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds' left leg, and is also true that the initials H.B. or legiple upon the lining of this hat. But as there are some thousands of Baker's and some hundreds of Henry Baker's in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them. What then did Peterson do? He brought around those hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interested in me. The goose was retained until this morning when there was signs that his bite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. His finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose when I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner. Did he not advertise? No. Then what clue could you have as to his identity? Only as much as we can deduce, from his hat, precisely, but you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt? Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who was worn this article? I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruthfully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape. Hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been a red silk, but was a good deal to scholars. There was no maker's name, but as Holmes had remarked, the initials H.B. was clawed upon one side. It was fierce in the brim for a hat's secure, but the elastic was missing. For the rest it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seems to have been some attempt to hide the discolored patches by smearing them with ink. I can see nothing, said I, handing it back to my friend. On the contrary Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see, you are too timid in drawing your inferences. Then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat. He picked it up and gazes it in the peculiar introspective fashion, which was characteristic of him. It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been, he remarked, and yet there are a few inferences which have very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual as of course obvious, upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well to do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now, than formally, pointing to a moral retrogression, which when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him. My dear homes, he has, however, retained some degree of self-respect. He continued disregarding my remonstrance. He is a man who leads a sedentary life. Goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle aged, has glistled hair, which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoint with lime cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house. You are certainly joking, homes, not in the least, is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained? I've no doubt that I'm very stupid, but I must confess that I'm unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual? For answer, homes, clap the hat upon his head, it came right over his forehead, and settled upon the bridge of his nose. It is a question of cubic capacity, said he, a man with so light of brain must have something in it. Did he climb of his fortune, then? This hat is free, is old. These flat brims, called at the edge, came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of RIP silk and the excellent lining. Is this man called a fault of biso expensive or hat three years ago and has had no hat since, then he is assuredly gone down in the world? Well, that is clear enough certainly, but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression? Sherlock Holmes laughed. Here is the foresight, said he putting his fingers upon the little disc and loop of the hat's a cure. They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that it has broken the elastic and has not travelled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formally, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he is endeavour to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by a doving them with ink, which is a sign that he is not entirely lost his self-respect. Your reason is certainly plausible. The further points that he is mid-lage, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime cream, are all together from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses the last number of hair ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odor of lime cream. The dust you will observe is not the gritty, grey dust of the street, but the fluffy round dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore hardly be in the best of training. But is why you said that she had ceased to love him? This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I still fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection. But he might be a bachelor. Now he is bringing home the goose as a piece offering to his wife, remember the card upon the Verde's leg. You have an answer to everything, but how an earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house? One tellow stain or even two might come by chance, but when I see no less than five, I think that they can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning talof, walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand, and a gussering candle in the other, any how he never got talow stains from a gas jet. I use satisfied. Well, it is very ingenious, so that I laughing. But since, as you said just now, there has been no crank emitted, and no harm done, save the loss of a goose. All this seems to be rather a waste of energy. Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open and Peterson, the commissioner, rushed into the apartment with flush cheeks, and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment. The goose, Mr. Holmes, the goose, sir, he got. Hey, what of it then? I didn't return to life and flat off through the kitchen window. Holmes proceeded himself round upon the sofa to get a fair review of the man's excited face. See here, sir, see what my wife found in its crop. He held out his hand and displayed upon the central of the palm, a brilliantly-syntilating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but a such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand. Sherlock Holmes sat out with a whistle. By Joe Peterson said he, this is treasure troving deed. I suppose you know what you have got. A diamond, sir, a precious stone. It cuts into glasses, though it were putty. It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone. Not the counters of more carved blue carbon-core, I ejaculated. Precisely so. I ought to know it's size and shape, seem that I have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately. It is absolutely unique and it's likely can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of a thousand pounds is certainly not within a 20th part of the market price. A thousand pounds, great lord of mercy, the commissioner plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us. That is the reward, and as I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the counters to part with half a fortune if she could but recover the gem. It was lost, if I remember a right, at the hotel Cosnor Pollaton I remarked. Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago, John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the ladies' drill case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assises. I have some account of the matter here, I believe. He remissed admit his newspapers, glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over and read the following paragraph. Hotel Cosnor Pollaton Jewel robbery, John Horner 26th plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd instant, a distracted from the gyr case of the counters of more car, the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, after attended at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he has shown Horner up to the dressing room of the counters of more car upon the day of the robbery, in order that he might sold of the second bar of the great which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time but had finally been called away. On returning he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open and that the swarm erocker case, in which, as it afterwards transpired, the counters was accustomed to keep a cure, was lying empty upon the dressing table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm and Horner was arrested at the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his room. Cussering Cussac made to the counters, deposed to having heard Ryder cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B. Division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery, having been given against a prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offense, but referred it to the assisers. Horner, who had shone signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court. Herm, so much for the police court said home, thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events needing from a rifle drill case at one end of the crop of a goose in Tottene court road at the other. You see what's now, little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone, the stone came from the goose and the goose came from Mr Henry Baker. The gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So no he must at herself very seriously to finding this gentleman and as the turning what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all evening papers. If this fail I shall have recourse to other methods. What will you say? Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now then found at the corner of Good Street a goose on a black felt hat. Mr Henry Baker can have the same by trying at 6.30 this evening at 2.21 B. Baker Street. That is clear and concise. Very but will he see it. Well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a very heavy one. He is clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson and the thought of nothing but flight. But since then he must have literally regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. He will be a pretty good one to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers. In which sir? Oh in the glow star Palmel since he came to his cassette evening use standard echo and then he has a set of curts to you. Very well sir and this stone. Oh yes I shall keep the stone. Thank you and I say Cleason just via goose on your way back and leave it here with me. For we must have wanted to give this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring. When the commissioner had gone, home took up the stone and held it against the light. It's a funny thing that he just he how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carponkour. Save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth there is already a sinister history. There have been two murders of vitriol throwing, a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this 40-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so Chrissia toy would be a perveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lucky it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countest to say that we have it. Do you think that this man Horner is innocent? I cannot tell. Well then do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter? It is I think much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was a considerably more value than if it were made a solid gold. That however I should determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement. And you can do nothing until then. Nothing. In that case I shall continue my professional round, but I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for I should like to see the solution of so tangled of business. Very glad to see you. I don't in at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs Hudson to examine its crop. I had been delayed at a case and it was a little after half past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was thuttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semi-circle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to hold his room. Mr Henry Baker I believe said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy aerogeneality which he could so readily assume. Pre-take this chair by the fire Mr Baker. It is a cold night and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for some of them for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat Mr Baker? Yes sir, there is undoubtedly my hat. He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head and a broad intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight firmer of his extended hand recalled homes as some eyes as to his habit. His rusty black front coat was thuttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his length wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his word with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill usage at the hands of fortune. We have retained these things for some days at home because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now while you did not advertise. Our visitor gave a rather shameful laugh. Her shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked. I had no doubt that the gang of rusts who has dusted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them. Very naturally, by the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it. To eat it, our visitor half wrote a mischere in his excitement. Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone, have we not done so. But I presume that the other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose is equally well. Oh certainly certainly answered Mr Baker was a sigh of relief. Of course, we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird, so if you wish the man burst into a hearty love. They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure, said he. But beyond that, I can hardly see what you see, disject a member of my later acquaintance are going to be to me. No sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my tension to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard. Sherlock Holmes glanced sharp to cross at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders. There is your hat then and there your bird said he. By the way, would it roar you to tell me where you got the other one from? I'm somewhat of a foul fancier and I have sold him a scene of better grown goose. Certainly sir said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. There are a few of us who frequently alpha in near the museum. We ought to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand. This year our good host will indicate by name, instituted a goose club by which, on considerations of some few pens every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pens were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you sir for a scotch fondot is fitted neither for my years nor my gravity. With a comical form positive man he bounced solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way. So much for Mr Henry Baker said Holmes, when he had closed the door behind him, it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry Watson? Not particularly, then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while he is still hot. By all means, it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped crevats about our throats. Outside the stars we shine in coldly in a cloudless sky and the breasts of the passes by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footballs rang out crisply and loudness which wongs through the doctor's quarter, wimpel street, harley street, and through wiggmore street into Oxford Street. In the quarter of the now we were in bloom free at the Alphate Inn which is a small public house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Hohman. Hohman pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy face white ape Prince Landlord. Your beer should be excellent if it is good as your geese said he. My geese, the man seems surprised. Yes, I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr Henry Baker who was a member of your goose club. Oh yes I see but you see sir, then it's not our geese. Indeed, who's then? Well I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden. Indeed, I know some of them which was it, Breckinridge is his name. Oh I don't know him but here's your good health landlord and prosperity to your house. Good night. Now for Mr Breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. Remember Watson that though we have so home near thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude and this we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march. We pass across Hoban down Endle Street and so through as exact of slums to Covent Garden Market one of the largest stalls for the name of Breckinridge, a thorned and the fribrator a horsey-looking man with a sharp face and trim side whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters. Good evening it's a cold night said homes. The southmen nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion. Sold out of geese I see continued homes, putting at the best lives of marble, let you have 500 to more of morning. That's no good. Well there are some on the stool with the gas flare but I've recommended to you who buy the landlord at the alpha. Oh yes I sent him a couple of dozen. Fine virtually word two, now where do you get them from? To my surprise the questions provoked a burst of anger from the southmen. Now of then Mr said he when he's head cocked in his arms at a timber. What are you driving at? Let's have it straight now. It is straight enough I should like to know who sold you a geese which you supplied to the alpha. Well then I can't tell you so now. Oh it is a matter of no importance but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle. One you'd be as warm maybe if you were as pest of as I am when I paid good money for a good article they should be an end of the business but it's where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese? One would think they would be the only geese in the world to hit a fuss that is made over them. Well I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said homes carelessly if you won't tell us the best is off. That is all but I'm always ready to back my opinions on the matter of fouls and I have a fiber on it that the bird I ate is country bread. Well then you've lost your fiber for its town bread snap the sultan. It's nothing of the kind I say it is. I don't believe it. Do you think you know more about fouls than I who have handled them ever since I was a nipper I tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bread. You'll never persuade me to believe that. Will you bet then it's merely taking your money for I know that I am right but I'll have a sovereign on it with you just to teach you not to be obstinate. The salesman chuckle grimly. Ha ha ha bring me the book spill said he. The small void brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy back to one. Lay them out together beneath the hanging nump. Now then Mr. Cockshaw said the thousand. I thought that I was out of peace but before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see the little book? Well that's the list of the folk from whom I buy. Do you see? Well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now then you see this other page in red ink. Well that is the list of my towns of flyers. Now look at that third name. Just read it out to me. Mrs. Oakshot, a 117 bricks and road, 249 red hones. Quite so now turn that up in the ledger. Holmes turned to the page indicated. Here you are Mrs. Oakshot, a 117 bricks and road egg and poultry supplier. Now then what's the last entry? December 22nd, 24 geese at 7 and 6 months. Quite so, there you are. And underneath, salt and Mr. Windigate of the Alpha at 12 shillings. What have you got to say now? Sherlock Holmes looked deeply shangering. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lampose and laughed in the hearty noise of the fashion which was peculiar to him. When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and a pink and protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet said he. I dare say that if I put £100 down in front of him, the man would not have given me such complete information as to draw from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well Watson, we are an fancy, nearly end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we could go on to this Mrs. Oakshot tonight or whether we should reserve it for tomorrow. Is clear from what that certainly fellow said that there are others beside ourselves her answers about the matter and I should, he remarked for suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the store which we had just left. Turning round we saw a rat-faced fellow standing in the center of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while Breckenridge, the southman, famed in the door of his door, was shaking his fist fiercely at the cringing figure. Oh I have had enough of you in your gaze, he shouted. I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me anymore with your silly talk, I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshot here and I'll answer her. But what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you? No, but one of them was mine all the same wine to this woman. Well then asked Mrs. Oakshot for it. She told me to ask you, well you can ask the king of Prisier but all I care, I'm very enough of it. Get out of this. He rushed fiercely forward and he inquire a flitter away into the darkness. This may save us of visit to Bristan Road with but homes. Come with me and we'll see what is to be made of this fellow, striding through the scattered knots of people who danced around the flaring stalls, my companions immediately over took the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round and I could see from the gaslight that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face. Oh, I use then. What do you want? He asked in a quavering voice. You would excuse me to at home blindly but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you. You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter? My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. But you can know nothing of this. Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavoring to trace some geese which was sold by Mrs. Oakshot of Bristan Road to a salesman named Brickenridge by him in turn to Mr. Windigate of the Elfer and by him to his club of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member. How has Sir? You are the very man who might long to meet, cry the little fellow, without a stretch hands and quivering things? I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter. Sherlock Holmes has hailed a four wheeler which was passing. In that case we had better discuss it in a cozy room rather than in this wind swept market place that he but pray to me before we go any farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting. The man has a tated for an instance. My name is John Robinson. He answered with a sideline glance. No, no, the real name said Holmes sweetly. Desoys awkward doing business with an alias. A flash sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. Well then said he, my room name is James Rida. Precisely so. Height attendants at the hotel, cosma, politan. Pray step into the cab and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which could wish to know. The little man stood glancing from one to the other, with half frightened, half hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sitting room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during a drive, but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the clasping to nonclasings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him. Here we are, said Holmes, cheerily, as we filed into the room. The fire looks very seasonal in this weather. You look cold Mr. Rida, pray take the basket chair. I would just put on my stiff as before we settle this little matter of yours. Now then you want to know what became of those geese. Yes sir, or rather a fancy of that goose. It was one bird I am mentioning which you were interested. White with a black bar across the tail. Rida quivered with emotion. Oh, sir, he cried. Can you tell me where it went to? It came here. Here? Yes, and the most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder who could take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead. The bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum. Our visitors stagger to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece which is right hand. Holmes unlocked the strong box and held up the blue carbuncle which shown out like a star with a cold, brilliant, many pointed radians. Rida's blaring with a drawn face, uncertain words acclaimed, or to disown it. The games up Rida said Holmes quietly, hold up man or he will be into the fire. Gizm and arm back into his chair Watson. He's not got bloody enough to go in for felony with impunity. Gizm had dash of brandy. So, now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is to be sure. For a moment he had staggered a nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour in his cheeks and he set a staring with frightened eyes as he's accuser. I have almost every link in my hands and all the proof which I could possibly need. So there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may be as well cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard Rida of this blue stone of the countess of more cars. Here, here, here, here, would Catherine Kusak who told me a little bit, said he in a crackling voice. I see. Her lady suits waiting made. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth, so easily acquired, was too much for you as it has been for better men before you. But you were not very scrupulous in the mean you used. It seems to me, Rida, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man, Horner, the flumber, had been concerned in some such matter before and that the suspicion would rest more readily upon him. What did you do then? You made some small jog in my lady's room. You and your Confederate Kusak, and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you right would the dual case raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then, Rida threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions' needs. To God say, have mercy, he shrieked. Think of my father of my mother. It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before. I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court. For Christ's say, don't. Get back into your chair, home, said Sterny. It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing. I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down. Humb, we would talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth. For their lives your only hope of safety. Rida passed his tongue over his parts lips. I will tell you, just as it happens, sir, said he, when Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once. Fred did not know, and what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me in my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house, she had known a man named Oakshot and lived in Brickson Road, where she fattened fouls for the market. All the way there, every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman, or a detective, and for all that it was a cold night. A sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brickson Road. My sister asked me what was a matter, and why I was so pale, but I told her that I'd be upset by the jaw rubber at the hotel, then I went into the backyard, and smoked a pipe, and wanted what it would be best to do. I had a friend once called Mordesley, who went to the bed, and has just been serving his time in Penthamville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me for a new one or two things about him. So I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money, but how to get to him in safety. I thought of the agony that I'd gone through and coming from the hotel. I might as any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my west coat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time, and looking at the geese, which were waddling about, around my feet, and suddenly I'd hear came into my head, which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived. My sister has told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in his I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed at the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds, a fine big one, white, with a bar tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down into its throat, as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone passed along its skull at, and down into its crop. But the creature flutters and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her, the brute broke loose, and fluttered off among the others. Whatever you do with that bird, Genn, says she. Well, said I, you said that you give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fastest. Oh, says she. We've said you're also side for you. Genn's bird, we call it, is the big white one over yonder. There's 26 of them which makes one for you, and one for us, and two doesn't for the market. Thank you, Maggie, says I. But if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now. Y'all there's a good three times heavier such she, and we've gotten to expressively for you. Never mind, I'll have the other, and I'll take it now, says I. Oh, just as you'd like, said she, a little hufft, which is it you want then? That white one with a bar toe, right in the middle of the flock. Oh, very well, Kinnett and take it with you. Well, I did what she said, Mr. Horns, and I coes a bird all away to Kelvin. I told my pearl what I'd done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like this, too. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird right back to my sisters and hoard into the back yard. It was not a bird to be seen there. Where are they all, Maggie? I cried. Gons of the dealers, Jim, which dealers, Britain rich of Kavan Garden. But there was another with a bar tail I asked, the same as the one I chose. Yes, Jim. There were two bar tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart. Well, then of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man beckon rich, but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me is to where they'd gone. You heard him yourself tonight. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks I'm going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself, and now, and now I'm myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth which I sold my character. God help me. God help me. He burst into convulsive sobbing with his space buried in his hands. There was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing, and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes fingertips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend Rose and threw open the door. Get out, said he. Well, sir, oh, heaven bless you. No more words, get out. A no more word were needed. Those are rush, a clatter upon the stairs. The bang of a door and a crisp rattle of running football from the street. After all, Watson said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horne were in danger, it would be another thing, but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again. He is too terribly frightened. Send him to jail now, and you make him a jailbird for life. Besides, it is the season of full given us. Chants have put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you have a goodness to touch the bell, Dr, we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature.

"Gaudenzia, Pride of the Palio",Marguerite Henry,4901,,"November 8, 2022",[],0,"e visit librevox.org. Read by Marie Christian. God Dindzia, Pride of the Palo, by Margarit Henry. Forward. For months I wrote the story of the Palo in my mind. I pictured a fearless boy rider in this wildest of all horse races. A boy who dared defy the ancient rules and willed his horse to win, and spite of the strict orders of his captain. When I finally went to Sienna and faced the real battle of the Palo, I had to scuddle my preconceived plot. No rider, no matter how brave, whatever defy the ancient rules of the race. They are as firm and immutable as the walls of the city. But the story I found was of heroic proportions, much bigger than the one I had dreamed. A peasant boy named Georgio Terny, and a half-brad Arabian mayor, seemed pawns of fate, doomed to a life of tragedy. Their battle to outwit destiny is a drama of human and animal courage. The secret plotting of the Palo is so strange that I had to journey from America to Sienna three times in order to understand the inner workings. There is a need in the people to relive the past, a need so intense that they change themselves into knights and noblemen of the Middle Ages for a brief moment each year. While I was there, I myself became embroiled in the passion of the Palo. I attended the solemn ritualistic banquet on the eve of the race, and afterward I went with Georgio Terny in his bodyguards to listen to music in the heart of the Piazza, and I went with him into the stable of the mayor, God Enziah. I wanted to study this courageous youth who was fully aware that tomorrow his blood and that of his mount might crimson the race course. I visited with Georgio's parents too, and with his brother and sister, and the huddled village of Monticello, far away in the Marima country. Because I spoke no Italian, we had to communicate in patamine, but it was more exciting than any game of charades. It concerned life and death. Twice I watched spellbound the pageant parade on Palo Day, and twice I shouted and prayed during the breakneck race that God Enziah would sweep wildly through the pact to victory. Dozens of people, cobblers and captains, peasants and princes gave of their time and energy to help make this book an authentic recreation of the oldest horse race in the long history of the sport of kings. At last I understood that the Paloia is a fire banked, but never quenched. Every summer it blazes a new into a festival of such drama and color, that the characters who take part might have stepped out of the middle ages.

Agincourt: A Romance,George Payne Rainsford James,27566,1.0,"October 16, 2022",[],0,"se visit librevox.org. Arrangor, Aromance by George Payne Reigns for James, chapter 1, the night ride. The night was as black as ink, not a solitary twinkling star looked out through that wide expanse of shadow which our great poet has called the blanket of the dark. Clouds covered the heaven. The moon had not risen to tinge them even with grey, and the sun had too long set to leave one faint streak of purple upon the edge of the western sky. trees, houses, villages, fields and gardens all lay in one profound obscurity, and even the course of the high road itself required eyes while accustomed to night travelling to be able to distinguish it, as it wandered on through a rich part of Hampshire amidst alternate woods and meadows. It's at that murky hour, a traveler on horseback road forward upon his way, at an easy pace and with a light heart, if one might judge by this natural, supremely ballads that broke from his lips as he trottyed on. These might indeed afford a frelatious indication of what was going on within the breast, and in this case they did so. The habit is more our master than we know, and often rules our external demeanor, whenever the spirit is called to take counsel in the deep chambers within, showing upon the surface without any effort on our part to hide our thoughts, a very different aspect from that of the mind's business at the moment. Thus then the traveler who thereroed along saluting the ear of night with scraps of all songs, sang in a low but melodious voice, was as thoughtful, if not as sad as it was in his nature to be. But yet as that nature was a cheerful one and all his habits were gay, no sooner with the eyes of the spirit called to the consideration of deeper things, then custom exercise her sway over the animal part, and he gave voices we have said to the old ballads which had sheared his boyhood and his youth. Whatever were his contemplations they were interrupted, just as he came to a small stream which crossed the road, and then wandered along at its side by first hearing the quick footfalls of a horse approaching, and an allowed but fine voice exclaiming, who goes there? A friend to all two men replied the traveler, a foe to all false naves, merry sings the trossal under the thorn, which be you, friend of the highway? Faith I hardly know, replied this stranger, every man is a bit of both I believe, but if you can tell me my way to Winchester I will give you thanks. I want nothing more, answered the first traveler drawing in his reign, but Winchester, good fate that is a long way off, and you are going from it master, and he endeavoured as far as the darkness would permit, to gain some knowledge of the strangers appearance. He seemed that a very young man of good proportions tall and slim, but with broad shoulders and long arms, he wore no cloak, and his dress fitting tacked to his body as was then the fashion of the day, allowed his into locutor to perceive the unencumbered outliners' vis-figger. A long way off, said the second traveler as his new acquaintance gave that to him, that is very unlucky, but all my stars are under that black cloud, what is to be done now, I wonder? What do you want to do, in quite the first traveler? Winchester is distant five and twenty miles or more. Oh, it's life, I want to find somewhere to lodge me and my horse for a night, replied the other, at a less distance than twenty-five miles, and yet not quite upon this very spot. Why not hand over, ask this companion, to spot six miles, and I am going there? Hmm, said the stranger in a tone not quite satisfied. It must be so, if better cannot be found, and yet my friend, I would find some other lodging. Is a no-in heart-buy, where carriers bake their beasts and fill their bellies, and country-fokes co-rows on nights of merry-making, or some old hauler, goodly cast or wear a chuckle bed or one of straw, and a nuncheon of bread and cheese and a draft of ale, is not likely to be refused to a traveler, with a good coat on his back and long-toed shoes. Oh, I, rejoined the first, of the latter there on many round, but on my life it will be difficult to direct you to them. The men of this part have a fondness for crooked ways, and unless you were the diglass who made them, or had some fair dame to guide you by the clue, you might wonder about for as many hours as it would take you to get to Winchester. Then, and over it must be, I suppose, of the other, though to say, sooth, I may there have to pay for a frolic, the score of which might be reckoned with other men than myself. A frolic, said his companion, nothing more my friend. No, my life, replied the other, a scurvy frolic, such as only a fool would commit, but when a man has nothing else to do, he is sure to fall into folly, and I am idle, perforce. Well, I'll believe you, answered the first after a moment's thought, I have thank heaven the gift of crudulity, and believe all that men tell me, come, I will turn back with you and guide you to a place at rest, though I shall be well laughed at for my pains. Not for an act of generous courtesy surely, said the stranger, quitting the half-gesting tone in which he had hit the twos spoken. If they laugh at you for that, I cannot, to lodge with them, and will not put your kindness to the test for I should look for a cold reception. Today, Nate, is not for that they will laugh, rejoin the other, and perhaps it may jump with my humour to go back to. If you have committed a folly in a frolic tonight, I have committed one in anger. Come with me therefore, and as we go, give me some name by which to call you when we arrive, that I may not have to throw you into my uncle's hall as a keeper with a dead deer, and more over before we go, give me your word that we have no follets here, for I would not for much, that anyone I brought should move the old nights' harp with up-but pleasure. There is my hand good you to reply this stranger following as the other turnties horse, and I never break my word, whatever men say of me, though they tell strange tales, as for my name, people call me Hall of Hathknock, it will do as well as any other. For the nons, I did his companion understanding well that it was assumed, but it matters not, as right on, and the gate shall soon be open to you, for I do not think they will be glad to see me back again, though I may not for chance they long. The port of Rosen nons at ten, as soon as he heard John Call. You seem learning through a countryman, said the traveler riding on by his side, but for chance I am speaking to a clerk. Good faves know, reply the first way for a more soldier than clerk, how of Hathknock, as old Robert of Langlan says, I cannot perfectly my patternoster as the priest it singeth, but I can rhyme of Robin Hood, and ran off early of Chester. I have chied my boyhood with many as son and my mouth with many aballant, when lying in the field upon the marches of Wales, I have wild away many a cold night with the Queen's map foot, said do a more, or, Richard of our main, while he was king, and then in the cold blast of march I ever found comfort in, someone is ecumen in, ludsinku ku, groweth seed and bloweth mode and springeth the work new. And good reason too, said Hathknock, I do the same in faith, and when wintry winds are blowing, I think ever that the warmer day may come and all be brighter again, work not for that indeed I might well be cold-hearted. Far, never flinch, groubly-scape companion, there is but one thing on earth should make a bold command called Hathknock, and what may that be, are the other, to lose his dinner? No good life explained the first, to lose his lady's love. Is it there the saddle-goals, said Hathknock, fake not a wit, answer to his fellow traveller, if it did I should leave off singing. You are wrong in your guest master how, I may lose my lady but not my lady's love, or I am much mistaken, and while that stays with me I will both sing and hope. This the best comfort replied Hathknock, and generally brings success, but what might it call you fester, for it Mars one speech to have no name for a companion? Now where it not my uncle's house within three miles said the other, I will pay you in your own coin and bid you call me Dick of Andover, for I am fond of secrets and keep them faithfully, except when they are likely to be found out, but such being the case now you must call me Richard of Woodville. If you would have my friends know you mean a poor square, who has ever sought the places where Hath blows our plenty, but who misdespers at Brammermore by being sent by his good friends, a Thomas Rookby, to bear tidings of Northumblins' incursion to the king. Now would fain have stayed in carried news of the victory, but good suits, so Thomas said he could trust me to tell the truth clearly as well as fight, and that, though he could trust the other so fight, he could not find one, who would not make them at it either more or less to the king than it really was. See what bad luck it is to be a plain spoken fellow? Good luck as well as bad, replied Hathknock, and in such conversation they pursued their way, writing not quite so fast as either have been doing when first they met, and slackening their pace to a walk where and about half a mile further forward, they quitted the high road and took to the narrow lanes of the country, which, as the reader may easily conceive, were not quite as good for travelling in those days, as even a present, when in truth they are often batting off. They soon issued fourth however upon a more open track, whether river again ran along by the roadside sheltered here and there by copsis, which occasionally rose from the very brink, and just as they regained it, the moon appearing over the low banks that fell crossing each other over its course, poured from beneath the fringe of heavy cloud that canopy the sky above, her full pale light upon the whole extent of the stream. There was something fine but melancholy in the sight, grey, fined even grand, and though there were none of those large objects which seemed generally necessary to produce the sublime, there was a feeling of fastness given by the broad expanse of shadow overhead, and the long line of glistening brightness below, broken by the thick black masses of brushwood that here and there bent over the flat surface of the water. This is fine, said Halib Hadnock, I love such night scenes with the solitary moon in the deep woods and the gleaming river, I even the dark clouds themselves. They are, to me, like a king's fate, were so many heavy things, brood over him, so many blackened impenetrable things around him, and where yet often a clear yet cold effulgence paused upon his way, grand and calm within the warmer and gay abeams that form upon the course of ordinary men. His companion turned engaged at him for a moment by the moonlight, but made no observation. So the other continued pointing with his hand, what is that drifting on the water, surely his man's head? An altar with a trout in his mouth, beating to his whole, replied Richard of Woodville, he would not be long in sight, see, he is gone, all things fly from man, we have established our character for butchery, with the brute creation and they wisely avoid the slaughterhouse of our presence. I thought it was something human, living or dead, replied Halib Hadnock, me things it were likely spot for a man to rid himself of his enemy, and give the carry into the waters, or for a love-lawn damsel, to very grief some memories, beneath the sleepy shining of the moonlight's stream. The locating promontry was an awful leap, and bold as well as sad must have been the heart to take it. But here Timmy dispends Mike to creep quietly into the soft closing wave, and find a more peaceful deathbed than the slow decay of a broken heart. Sad thoughts, sad thoughts, reply Richard of Woodville, and yet you seem, merry enough just now. I, the thick comes upon me as it will come, raid, replied the other, and good faith I strive not to prevent it. I am used myself with my own humans, standing as it were without myself and looking inward like a spectator at a tawny. Now laughing at all I see, now ready to weep, and yet for the world I would not stop the sea, where it in my power to cast down my water at the keenest point of strife and say, pause, no more. Sometimes they lives not a merry heart on this side to sea, and sometimes not a satter within the waters. At one time I could laugh like a clown at a fair, and at others would make ballads to their little stars full of sad homilies. Not so I, rejoined Richard of Woodville, I strived for an equal mind. I would fain be always like hearty, and though when I am crossed, I may be hot and tasty, ready to strike with others or myself, yet in good truth I soon learn to bear with all things and to endure the ills that fall to my portion, as likely as may be. Man's of East of Bird, and Namaskary, his pack saddle, so it is better to do it quietly than to kick under the load. Out upon those who go seeking for sorrows, a sort of commodity they may find at their own door. One wine's are over-amazing gratitude, and another takes to heart the score of the great, another bruise over his merit neglected, and his good deeds forgotten. But were they wise, and did good without thought of thanks, with a high of heart, and knew themselves as great in them in most soul, as the greatest in the land. Were they bright in mind and found pleasure in the mind's exercise? They were both married more, and repy in less, I, and be pure of their due, in the end. By my life you said you were no clerk-culture of woodville, quite his companion, and here you have preached me a sermon, fitted to banish moon-sick melon-colly from the land. But say good youth, is yonder-like looking out of your uncle's hall window, there far on the other side of the street? No, no, answered woodville, right after it, and see how far it would lead you. You also find yourself neck-deep in a swamp. Tisawil of the whisp, my uncle's house lies on before, beyond the village of Abbot's hand, just a quarter of a mile from the abbey. So as the one brother owns the hall and the other rules of monastery, they can aid incontinence each other, whether it be at a merry-making or a broil. Then too, as the good Abbot is as weak as a new, in a may-morning, and the Philip is as fiery as a sun in June, the one containing the other's wrath or work-up his courage, as the case may be. But here we see the first houses and lights in the window too. Why, how now, dane Julian has not gone to bed? But I forgot there is a glutton-mass tomorrow, and as the Reeves wife she must be cooking capons truly. But hark, there is a sound of a sithin, and someone's singing, good faith are making merry by their fireside, though curfew has told long since. Well, heaven's end or good men are cheerfully evening and a happy half. Perhaps they have some poor minstrel within, and are keeping up his hark with kindness. For Julian is a bound to full-dame, and the Reeve, though somewhat hard upon the young naves, is no way pinched when there is a sad face at his door. Well fester, which are soon be home, a pleasant place as home, I, it is a pleasant place, and won't far away we think of it always. God help the man who has no home and let all good Christians be friend him, for he has need. Although hark have not made no further observations upon his companions mood and character, there was something therein that struck and pleased him greatly, and he was no mean judge of his fellow men, for he had mingled with many of every class and degree. Duke and ready in discovering by small traits the secrets of that complicated mystery, the human heart. He saw even in the love of music and poetry, in a man habituated to camps and fields of battle, a higher and finer mind, than the common society of the day afforded. For it must not be thought that either in the night or the night's sun, of our old friend Chaucer, the poet gave an accurate picture of the gentry of the age. But there were not such is not to be doubted, but they were few, and the generality for nobos and gentleman of those times were sadly illiterate and rude. The occasional words of Richard of Woodville let drop to regarding his own scheme of home philosophy, showed his companion thought, a strength and rigor of character which might be serviceable to others as well as himself, in any good and honorable cause. The tale of Hadnok, as they were drawn, said to himself, I will see more of this man. After passing through the little village and issuing out again into the open country, they saw by the light of the moon now rising higher, and dispersing the clouds as she advanced, a high, isolated hills standing out, detached from all the woods and scattered heteros round. At a little distance from its base upon the left appeared the tall pinnacles and tower of an abbey, and a church cutting dark against the lustrous sky behind, and partly hidden by the trees on the right, partly rising above them, were seen the bold lines of another building in a sternest style of architecture. That is your on-custling, I suppose, that Halif hadnok pointing on with his hand, shall we find anyone up? It is hard upon ten o'clock. Oh no fear, replied Richard of Woodville, good so fill it beachum sits late in the hall, he will not take his white head to the pillow for an hour or two, and the ladies like well to keep him company. Here to the left is a shorter way through the wood, but look to your horse's footing for the woodman were busy this morning, and may have left branches about. In less than five minutes more they were before the embattled gates of one of those old English dwellings, half-castle, half-house, which denoted the owner to be a man of station and consideration. Just a step below in Fort Tuner rank, those mighty barons who sheltered themselves from the storms of the factious and lawless epoch, in Fort Chutes' filled with an army of retainers and dependants. As they approached Richard of Woodville raised his voice and called aloud, Tim Morris, Tim Morris. He waited a moment singing to himself that two verses he had repeated before. The porter rose again, served ten, as soon as he heard John Call. And then added, but it will be different now, I fancy, for honest Tim is as deaf as a miller, and his voice sound a sleep-hice aspect. Tim Morris, I say, he will keep us here all night. Tim Morris, how now old sluggered? He continued as the ancient porter, rolled back the gate. Were you snoring your wicker chair that you make us dance attendance as you do the country folk of a Monday morning? This fit they should learn to dance the Morris dance, as they call it Master Dick, answer the porter laughing and holding up his lantern. God you, you, sir, I thought you were gone for the night and I was tripping off my jerking. Is Timian of Røydengodnan, asked Woodville? Nacer, he states all night, answer the porter, here boy, here, naive, tend the out and run across the court to take the horses. A sleep-boy with senses yet but half awake, crept out from the door on followed Richard of Woodville in his companion, as they rode across the small space that separated the gate from the hall itself. There, at a flight of steps leading to a portal which might well have served a church, they dismounted, and advancing before his fellow traveler, Richard of Woodville raised the heavy bar of Hamadayan, which served for a latch, and entered the hall singing aloud. As I rode on a Monday between Wettend and Wall all along the broadway, I met a little man with all. As he spoke he pushed back the door for hell of had not to enter, and as Seymour's presented to his companion's site which deserves rather to begin than to end a chapter.

It was past midnight and someone was knocking on Dr. Rabbit's door. Dr. Rabbit growled a little, for he did not like to be wakened at that time of night. Even if he was a doctor, but he got up anyway and opened the upstairs window in his big tree. The big round moon was shining very bright. It shone quite clear on the one who was knocking at the door. Now who do you suppose it was? Well, it was someone Dr. Rabbit didn't want to see. I should say he didn't, for it was Tom Wildcat knocking. And he was about the worst enemy Dr. Rabbit had in the big green woods. So it was a mighty good thing he didn't go down and open his front door. What do you want at my house this time of night? Dr. Rabbit called down sharply? Tom Wildcat jumped back a little. He was so surprised to hear someone talking above him. Oh, he explained, looking up, how do you do, Dr. Rabbit? I just came over to have you put some cell on my hind foot. I heard it pretty bad a while ago. Now Dr. Rabbit didn't believe all the time, so he said, well, that doesn't interest me. But how did you heard it? Well, said Tom Wildcat, I stepped on something in the dark, a sticker or something. Then all of a sudden I found my foot bleeding and mighty sore. Dr. Rabbit knew very well how very cunning Tom was, so he spoke right up and said, if you don't tell me the real truth, I won't look at your foot at all. That was pretty plain, and Tom Wildcat saw there was no other way, but to tell the truth. Well, he said, the fact is I was borrowing a hand from farmer Rose Chickenhouse, and his big dog and I had a little trouble before I came to the house. His big dog and I had a little trouble before I could get away. Ah, ha, I see, said Dr. Rabbit, peering slightly down at Tom and looking very wise. Well, I'll just shut my window, and you can come up. You'll find a small hole under the window. Put your foot through it, and I'll look at it. Then Dr. Rabbit shut the window, locked it and sat down to wait. Tom grumbled more than a little about having to climb the tree with a sore foot. But as there was no other way, he began pulling and climbing into the bark, and up he went. Every now and then he heard his foot against the tree and would have to stop. This made him pretty mad. But by and by he got up to the window, and there he stopped to rest a bit and get his breath. Then he looked at the hole under the window and called out, what are you going to do with my foot? Why, how can I tell, till I see it? Dr. Rabbit called back, and all the wild he was chuckling so much. He was afraid Tom might hear. After thinking it over, Tom had decided that perhaps he could put his foot through the hole, and at the same time, look through the window and see what Dr. Rabbit was doing. But there was no way he could do this. So he turned round with his head down and held onto the bark of the tree while he put his foot through the hole under the window. Dr. Rabbit saw right away, the Tom wild cats foot really was sore, but it wasn't very bad. So chuckling more than ever, he went to his medicine closet and got out a box of south. It was what Dr. Rabbit called his hot medicine, and it certainly was hot. It would cure a sore foot all right, but Dr. Rabbit didn't use it very often. He kept it only for someone like his present patient. Hurry up, Tom called out most impatiently. Dr. Rabbit was already, so he called back. All right there Tom, hold right still, and slack the lot of that hot, sad, right on the sore foot just where it hurt the most. Oh, Tom gave a yell out enough to be heard all over the big green woods, and down the tree he went.

Has your highness seen the lady viola tonight? Asked a gallant turbidore of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm. Yes, is she not lovely though so sad? Her dress is well chosen too, for in a witch she wedes Count Antonio whom she passionately hates. By my faith I envy him. Yonder he comes, a raid like a bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her stern father bestows her hand. Return to the turbidore. Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist to answer steps in his spurn by the old Count. Said the lady, as they joined the dance. The revel was at its height when a priest appeared and was drawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet. He motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell on the gale throng, and not a sound but the dash of fountains, or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as Count Adelaan spoke thus. My Lord, Zerand lead, these are part of the aruse to buy which I have gathered you here until we witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we weak to your services. All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained all tongues till the holy right was over. Then the eager spectators gathered round the Count, demanding an explanation. Gladly we'd give it if I could, but only know that it was the whim of my team at Veyola, and a yielded to it. I now matured, and let the play end, on the mask and receive my blessing. But neither bent the knee, for the young bride groom replied in a tone that startled all listeners of the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand Defero, the artist lover, and leaning on the breast ran out flashed to the star of an English Earl with the lovely Veyola, radiant with joy and beauty.

I can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Defero and Defero, when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth, in return for the beloved hand of this Ferd lady, now my wife.

The March of the Battalion compared with other historical marches. The Lieutenant Colonel commanding congratulates the Battalion on their safe arrival on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, and the conclusion of their march of over 2,000 miles, history will be searched and vane for an equal march of infantry. So wrote Lieutenant Colonel P. St. George Cook in, Order Number 1 from Headquarters Mormon Battalion, Mission of San Diego, under date of January 30, 1847. If Colonel Cook is accurate in his statement, and one has a right to assume that he is, since he was a graduate of the United States military Academy of West Point, and hence versed in history of such military incidents, then the March of this Battalion is a very wonderful performance. For if history might be searched in vain for an equal march of infantry, when Colonel Cook wrote his Order Number 1, then certainly no march of infantry since that time has equaled it. The only other historical marches that are comparable with the Mormon Battalion's march are Zedafans and Donathans, the former in ancient the latter in modern times. Retreat of the 10,000. Zedafans march is commonly known as the Retreat of the 10,000. 401 BC. The account of the retreat is given in Zedafans and Abbasis. About 14,000 Greek soldiers and a Spartan leader named Clirchrist entered the service of a Persian prince Cyrus, surname the younger, brother of the den-raining King of Persia, and Azirq seized the second. The purpose of Cyrus was to deprive his brother of the throne of Persia and reign in his stead. The expedition marched through Asia Minor to Canoxia, near Old Babylon, where an army of 900,000's Persians engaged the army of Cyrus, which, with his Greek auxiliaries, numbered by 300,000. The smaller army was really successful in the battle, but a rash attempt on the part of Cyrus to slay his brother during the engagement in which he himself was killed, changed the fortunes of the day. The expedition ended in failure, and hence the retreat of the Greek 10,000, up the valley of the Tigris through Armenia to Trevezon, the Greek city on the design, our modern black sea. The march of Greek infantry, though attended with almost incredible hardships, from cold hunger and the assaults of enemies, was not equal to the march of the Mormon battalion for the reason that it covered that 1500 miles, as against the 2000 miles covered by the battalion. While the Greek infantry in their retreat numbered more men than the battalion, and fought many battles, their march was, for the most part, through set of lands and along well-defined roads, while the greater part of the battalion's march was through desert lands, and 474 miles of it, through trackless deserts were nothing but savages and wild beasts were found. Or deserts were, for one of water, there was no living creature. Donafin's expedition into Mexico. Donafin's march occurred in the same year, and in the same war in which the battalion served, the war with Mexico, 1846. The march is known as Donafin's expedition into Mexico. The expedition started from Santa Fe and marched to Matamores near where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about 13 or 1400 miles. Footnote. I am aware that the historian of Donafin's expedition, William E. Connelly, credits the expedition with a grand circuit of 5,500 miles. 2,500 miles of which he states was by water, leaving a distance of 3,500 miles by land. But he accounts the expedition as starting from independence of Zurich and returning to it, whereas the expedition was organized and began his great march at Santa Fe and then entered Matamores, who had embarked for home. In footnote. The march was via El Paso, Chihuahua, Parras, Saldo, and Monterey. Thens to Matamores. Here the expedition embarked for New Orleans, where the men were mustered out of service. The important battles of Bracito and Sacramento were fought in route. The former placing El Paso and the latter at the city of Chihuahua, capital of the state of the same name, in the hands of the Americans. The expedition numbered about 900 men, mostly from Missouri, and under the command of Colonel Alexander W. Donafin of that state, and returned to Missouri via the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi. The march overland it will be observed was less than that of the battalions. For the most part, moreover, Donafin's march was through a settled country and over roads long used between Santa Fe and points in northern and central Mexico. Besides, the expedition was not exclusively made up of infantry, being mixed cavalry and infantry, and therefore would not strictly come in competition with a battalion, which was entirely of infantry, with a company baggage wagons. Donafin's expedition is so wonderful a performance however, and has been so generously acclaimed that if unmentioned and connection with the performance of the battalion and the contrast made above, it might be thought by some to rival the march of the latter. This however is not the case. The world's record for a march of infantry, not even in the world's great war, now happily ended, as the Mormon battalions march been equaled, though in all other things that war has surpassed the previous war experiences of mankind, and since the battalions march has not been equaled by any march of infantry in the world's great war, nor in ancient times, it is not likely now, owing to the new methods for the transportation of troops that have been developed, that the Mormon battalions march across more than half of the northern American continent will ever be equaled. It will stand as a world's record for a march of infantry.

And if you will listen very carefully. And remember what I say. You will save yourselves much trouble and worry. And your master's and mistress's will of you. And treat you well. First of all, Buster come back here. Here Jip Seed stopped until Buster came back. Buster was always hungry. And whenever anyone came into the yard, He thought it was time for dinner. But at the sound of his mother's voice, He knew she did not mean to waste any time. And ran back and Jip Seed went on. First of all, never, never scratch or bite a child. No matter how badly it hurts you. Let it pull you a ear, scent, and sit on you. But never, never bite. And Jip Seed here looked very solemn as if to try to make her children see how wicked it would be for a dog to hurt a child. Another thing she went on is this, When you are playing in the house, Be very careful not to upset anything. And above all things, If you find a sleeper or a shoe lying around anywhere, Do not shake it to pieces. Nor bite holes in it. If you do, you will be sure to be whipped and put out of doors. Can't you play at all? Say it, Fritz. Do the expect us to lie down and sleep all the time. The way a cat is? No, of course not. Say it, Jip Seed. A little experience will teach you what you can play with. Maybe they will give you a ball or maybe an old rubber. That you can play with whenever you want to. And children, Here Jip Seed looks straight and bustle with a front. That made him hide his head behind pretty. No matter what else you do, Don't steal from the pantry. I didn't begin bustle, But his mother interrupted him. No, I know you didn't, But you will have, if you could. And another thing, Almost the most important of all, Is to remember to be dignified. You are not common dogs, And so, Must not forget always to be on your dignity. You are both turnterias. And your grandfather was Aladdin. Remember this, my children, And be proud of it. I should die of shame if any of my children Should fail to live up to the reputation of our family. And now, why so, Jip Seed saw that her puppies were restless. For it's very hard for puppies to sit still, Very long at a time. And so, with a parting morning to remember all she had told them, She let them run off to play. It was well, The mother gave the children this advice on the day she did. For the next morning, The little family were scattered. Never to be all together again. Nor have any family reunion as people do. But that is all in a dog's life. Their master intended to go to Europe for the following winter. And because he did not want to keep so many dogs while away, Had offered them for sale. And so, on the very next day, They were to go to their new masters or mistresses as the case might be. The first or I was a fashionable dressed lady with her French maid. They honed, they are hard, over the dogs, And had a great time deciding which was the prettiest. Oh, madam, this one, she is a most pretty. She has such soft fight hair, And she will look more beautiful with the French bow on the back of a neck. You are right, Celeste. She will, and I can change the bows to match my guns. Oh, mother, I don't want to go with them. Said pretty, for it was pretty of whom they were speaking. I am afraid the French maid will be crossed when her mistress is not around. You know, dogs can tell who are their friends and who are only pretending. I am very sorry you do not like her dear, But be a good girl. Maybe the maid will not stay with the lady, And you will like the next one better. Here, pretty, pretty, pretty, come out from under that manger. Call the coachman, who was taking care of the dogs. She had escaped from the coach house into the stable, Where the horses were kept. And here she had hidden in the stall of her favourite horse. But the coachman fished her out.

Short Ghost and Horror Collection 061,Various,51160,2.0,"August 6, 2022",[],0,"sit LibraVox.org. Read by Dale Growthman. Mary was a misfit. She didn't want to be beautiful. And she wasted time doing mad things, like eating and sleeping. The beautiful people by Charles Bumont. Mary sat quietly and watched the handsome man's legs blown off. Watched further as the great ship began to crumble and break into small pieces in the middle of the blazing night. She fidgeted slightly as the men and parts of men came floating dreamily through the wreckage out into the awful silence. And when the meteorite shower came upon the men, gouging holes through everything, tearing flesh and ripping bones, Mary closed her eyes. Mother. Mrs. Cuberley glanced up from her magazine. Hmm. Do we have to wait much longer? I don't think so. Why? Mary said nothing but looked at the moving wall. Oh, that. Mrs. Cuberley laughed and shook her head. That tired old thing. Read a magazine, Mary. Like I'm doing. We've all seen that a million times. Does it have to be on mother? Well, nobody seems to be watching. I don't think the doctor would mind if I switched it off. Mrs. Cuberley rose from the couch and walked to the wall. She depressed a little button and the life went from the wall, flickering and glowing. Mary opened her eyes. Honestly, Mrs. Cuberley said to the woman sitting beside her, you'd think they'd try to get something else. We might as well go to the museum and watch the first landing on Mars. The Maya rocket disaster? Really? The woman repeated without distracting her eyes from the magazine page. That's the doctor's idea. Psychology. Mrs. Cuberley opened her mouth and moved her head up and down knowingly. Oh, I should have known there was some reason. Still, who watches it? That children do makes them think. Makes them grateful or something. Oh, psychology. Mary picked up a magazine and leaf through the pages. All photographs of women and men. Women like mother and like others in the room. Slander, tan, shapely beautiful women. And men with large muscles and shiny hair. Women and men all looking alike. All perfect and beautiful. She folded the magazine and wondered how to answer the questions that would be asked. Mother, gracious, what is it now? Can't you sit still for a minute? But we've been here three hours. Mrs. Cuberley sniffed. Do I really have to? Now don't be silly, Mary. After those terrible things you told me, of course you do. And all of skinned women in a transparent white uniform came into the reception room. Cuberley? Mrs. Zina, Cuberley? Yes? The doctor will see you now. Mrs. Cuberley took Mary by the hand and they walked behind the nurse down a long corridor. A man who seemed in his middle 20s looked up from a desk. He smiled and gestured toward to a joining chairs. Well, well, Dr. Hurrell, I, the doctor snapped his fingers. Of course I know. Your daughter. Ha ha. I certainly do know your trouble. Get so many of them nowadays. Takes up most of my time. You do, as Mrs. Cuberley? Frankly, it had begun to upset me. Upset? Hmm, not good, not good at all. Ah, but then if people did not get upset, we psychiatrist would be out of a job. A, go the way of the early MD. But I assure you I need to hear no more. He turned his hands of face to Mary. Little girl, how old are you? 18, sir. Oh, a real bit of impatience. It's just about time, of course. What might your name be? Mary, charming, and so unusual. Well, now, Mary, may I say that I understand your problem. Understand it thoroughly? Mrs. Cuberley smiled and smoothed the sequence on her blouse. Madam, you have no idea how many there are these days. Sometimes it praise on their minds so that it affects him physically, even mentally. Makes them exchange. Say peculiar, unexpected things. When little girl I recall was so distracted, she did nothing but brood all day long. Can you imagine? That's what Mary does. When she finally told me, Doctor, I thought she had gone, you know. That bad, eh? A afraid will have to start a reeducation program very soon. Or they'll all be like this. I believe I'll suggest it to the Senator day after tomorrow. I don't quite understand, Doctor. Simply, Mrs. Cuberley, that the children have got to be thoroughly instructed. Thurly, too much is taken for granted, and childish minds somehow refuse to accept things without definite reason. Children have become far too intellectual, which, as I trust I need and remind you, is a dangerous thing. Yes. What has this to do with Mary? Everything, of course. Mary, like half the 16, 17, and 18-year-olds today, has begun to feel acutely self-conscious. She feels that her body has developed sufficiently for the transformation, which, of course, it has not, not quite yet. And she cannot understand the complex reasons that compelled her to wait until some future date. Mary looks at you at the women all about her, at the pictures, and then she looks into a mirror. From pure perfection of body, face, limbs, pigmentation, carriage, stance, from Simon pure perfection, if I may be allowed the expression, she sees herself at his horrified. Isn't that so my dear child? Of course, of course. She asks herself, why must I be hideous, unbalanced, oversized, undersized, full of revolting skin eruptions, badly scheme dorganically? In short, Mary is tired of being a monster, and is overly anxious to achieve what almost everyone else has already achieved. That, said Mrs. Kiberley. This much you understand, doubtless. Now, Mary, what you object to is what our society offers you, and the others like you. No, convicing logic on the side of waiting until age 19. It is all taken for granted, and you want to know why. It is that simple. A non-technical explanation will not suffice, mercy know. The modern child wants facts, solid, technical data, to satisfy her every question. And that, as you can see, will take a good deal of reorganizing. But, said Mary, the child is upset, nervous, tense. She acts strange, peculiar, odd, worries you, and makes herself ill because it is beyond our migra powers to put it across. I tell you what we need is a whole new basis for learning. And that will take doing. It will take doing, Mrs. Kiberley. Now, don't you worry about Mary, and don't you worry child, I'll prescribe some pills, and no, no, doctor, you're all mixed up, right, Mrs. Kiberley? I beg your pardon, madam. What I mean is, you've got it wrong. Tell him, Mary, tell the doctor what you told me. Mary shifted un-easily in the chair. It's that, I don't want it. The doctor's well-proportioned jaw dropped. Would you please repeat that? I said, I don't want the transformation. Did, don't want it? You see, she told me, that's why I came to you. The doctor looked at Mary suspiciously. But that's impossible. I've never heard of such a thing. Little girl, are you playing a joke? Mary nodded negatively. She said, I don't want to be a doctor. What can it be? Mrs. Kiberley rose and began to pace. The doctor plucked his tongue and took from a small cupboard a black box covered with buttons and dials and wires. Oh, no, you don't think I mean, could it? We shall soon see the doctor revolved a number of dials and studied a single bulb at the center of the box. He did not flicker. He removed handles from Mary's head. Dear me, the doctor said, dear me, your daughter is perfectly saying, Mrs. Kiberley. Well, then what is it? Perhaps she is lying. We haven't completely eliminated that factor as yet. It slips into certain organisms. Our tests, more machines, and more negative results. Mary pushed her foot in a circle on the floor. When the doctor put his hands on her shoulders, she looked up pleasantly. Little girl said the hands of man, do you actually mean to tell us that you prefer that body? Yes, sir. May I ask why? I like it. It's hard to explain, but it's me. And that's what I like. Not the looks, maybe. But the me. You can look in a mirror and see yourself. Then look at, well, at your mother and be content. Yes, sir. Mary thought of her reasons. Thuzzy, vague, but very definitely there. Maybe she had said the reasons. No, only a part of it. Mrs. Cuberley, the doctor said, I suggest that your husband have a long talk with Mary. My husband is dead. That affair near Ganyme, I believe. Something like that. Oh, splendid. Rocketman, eh? Very interesting organisms. Something always seems to happen to rocketman one way or another. But I suppose we should do something. The doctor scratched his jaw. When did she first start talking this way? He asked. Oh, for quite some time. I used to think it was because she was such a baby. But lately the time getting so close and all, I thought I'd better see you. Of course, very, very wise. Because she also do odd things. Well, I found her on the second level one night. She was lying on the floor. And when I asked her what she was doing, she said she was trying to sleep. Mary flinched. She was sorry in a way that mother had found that out. To, did you say sleep? That's right. Now where could she have picked that up? No idea. Mary, don't you know that nobody sleeps anymore? That we have an infinitely greater lifespan than our poor ancestors. Now that the wasteful state of unconsciousness has been conquered? Child, have you actually slept? No one knows how anymore. No, sir. But I almost did. The doctor's side. But it's unheard of. How could you begin to try to do something people have forgotten entirely about? The way it was described in the book. It sounded nice. That's all. Mary was feeling very uncomfortable now. Home and no talking man and a foolish white gown. Books? Books? There are books in your unit, madam? There could be. I haven't cleaned up in a while. That is certainly peculiar. I haven't seen a book for years. Not sit 17. Mary began to fidget and stare nervously about. But with the tapes, why should you try to read books? Where do you get them? That he did. He got them from his father and so did grandpa. He says they're better than tapes and he was right. This is cubly flushed. My husband was a little strange, doctor. He kept those things despite everything I said. Dear me. I excuse me. The muscular black hair doctor walked to another cabinet and selected from a shelf, a bottle. From the bottle he took two large pills and swallowed them. Sleep? Books? Doesn't want the transformation? This is cubly my dear good woman. This is grave. Doesn't want the transformation? I would appreciate it if you would change psychiatrists. I am very busy and this is somewhat specialized. I suggest central dome. Many fine doctors there. Goodbye. The doctor turned and sat down in a large chair and folded his hands. Every watch him and wondered why the simple statements should have so changed things. But the doctor did not move from the chair. Well, said Mrs. Kibberley and walked quickly from the room. The man's legs were being blown off again as they left the reception room. Mary considered the reflection in the mirrored wall. She sat on the floor and looked at different angles of herself. Profile, full face, full length, naked, clothed. Then she took up the magazine and studied it. She sighed. Mirror mirror on the wall. The words came haltingly to her mind and from her lips. She hadn't read them she recalled. Daddy had said them, quoted them as he put it. They too were lines from a book. Who is the fairest of? A picture of mother set up on the dresser and Mary considered this now. Looked for a long time at the slender feminine neck. The golden skin, smooth and without blemish, without wrinkles, and without age. The dark brown eyes and the thin tapers of eyebrows. The long, black lashes set evenly so that each half of the face corresponded precisely. The half parted mouth, a violent tint against the gold. The white, white teeth, even sparkling. Mother, beautiful, transformed mother and back again to the mirror. Love them all. The image of a rather chubby girl without lines of rhythm or grace, without perfection. Splotchy skin, full of little holes. Puffs in the cheeks. Red eruptions on the forehead. Perspiration, shapeless hair flowing into shapeless shoulders down a shapeless body. Like all of them before the transformation. Did they all look like this before? Did mother, even? Mary thought hard, trying to remember exactly what Daddy and Grandpa had said. Why they said the transformation was a bad thing, and why she believed, and agreed with them so strongly. It made little sense, but they were right. They were right. And one day she would understand completely. This is cubarly slammed the door angrily and married jump to her feet. She hadn't forgotten about it. The way you upset Dr. Hurrell, he won't even see me anymore, and these traumas are getting horrible. I'll have to get that awful Dr. Wagner. Sorry. Mrs. cubarly sat on the couch and crossed her legs carefully. What in the world are you doing on the floor? Trying to sleep? Now I won't hear of it. You've got to stop it. You know you're not insane. Why should you want to do such a silly thing? The books, and Daddy told me about it, and you mustn't read those terrible things. Why is there a law against them? Well, no, but people tired of books when the tapes came in. You know that the house is full of tapes anything you want. Mary stuck out her lower lip. They're no fun all about the wars and the colonizations. And I suppose the books are fun. Yes, they are. And that's where you got this idiotic notion that you don't want the transformation, isn't it. Of course it is. Now we'll see to that Mrs. cubarly rose quickly and took the books from the corner and from the closet and filled her arms with them. She looked everywhere the room and gathered the old rotten volumes. These she carried from the room and threw into the elevator. A button guided the door shut. I thought you'd do that, Mary said, that's why I hid most of the good ones where you'll never find them. Mrs. cubarly took a satin hackerchief to her eyes and began to weep. Just look at you. Look, I don't know what I ever did to deserve this. Deserve what, mother? What am I doing? It's so wrong. Mary's mind rippled in a confused stream. What? Mrs. cubarly screamed? What? Do you think I want people to point to you and say, I'm the mother. Are you sure of an idiot? That's what they'll say. You'll see. Or she looked up hopefully. Have you changed your mind? No. The vague reasons long to be put into words. It doesn't hurt. They just take off a little skin and put some on and give you pills and electronic treatments and things like that. It doesn't take more than a week. No. The reason. Don't you want to be beautiful like other people like me? Look at your friend Shala. She's getting her transformation next month. And she's almost pretty now. Mother, I don't care. If it's the bones you're worried about, well, that doesn't hurt. They give you a shot and when you wake up everything's molded right. Everything to suit the personality. I don't care. I don't care. But why? I like me the way I am. Almost. Almost exactly. But not quite. Part of it, however. Part of what Daddy and Grandpa meant. But you're so ugly, dear. Like Dr. Hortell said. And Mr. Wilmus at the factory. He told some people he thought you were the ugliest girl he'd ever seen. He'll be thankful when you have your transformation. And what if he hears about all of this? What will happen then? Daddy said I was beautiful. Well, really dear, do you have eyes? Daddy said that real beauty is only skin deep. He said a lot of things like that. And when I read them in the books, I felt the same way. I guess I don't want to look like everybody else. That's all? No. It's not it. Not it at all. The man had too much to do with you. You'll notice that he had his transformation, though. But he was sorry. He told me that if he had to do it over again, he'd never do it. He said for me to be stronger than he was. Well, I won't have it. You're not going to get away with this young lady. After all, I'm your mother. I'm a bulb flickered in the bathroom, and Mrs. Cuberly walked uncertainly to the cabinet. She took out a little cardboard box. Time for lunch. Mary nodded. That was another thing the books talked about, which the tapes did not. Lunch seemed to be something special long ago, or at least different. The books talked of strange ways of putting a load of things into the mouth and chewing these things, enjoying them, strain, and somehow wonderful. And you'd better get ready for work. Yes, mother. The office was quiet, and without shadows. The walls gave office steady luminescence, distributed the light evenly upon all the desks and tables, and it was neither hot nor cold. Mary held a ruler firmly, and allowed the pen to travel down the metal edge effortlessly. The new black lines were small and accurate. She tipped her head, compared the notes beside her, to the plan she was working on. She noticed the beautiful people looking at her more furtively than before, and she wondered about this as she made her lines. This tall man rose from his desk at the rear of the office, and walked down the aisle to Mary's table. He surveyed her work, allowing his eyes to travel cautiously from her face to the draft. Mary looked around. Nice job, said the man. Thank you, Mr. Wilmus. Graylick shouldn't have anything to complain about. That crane should hold the whole damn city. It's a very good ally, sir. Yeah. Say, kid, you got a minute? Yes, sir. Let's go to Mullinson's office. The big handsome man led the way into a small cubby hole of a room. He motioned to a chair and sat on the edge of one desk. He had I have never been one to beat around the bush. Somebody called in while I go gave me some crazy story about you not wanting the transformation. Mary said, oh, Daddy had said it would have to happen someday. This must be what he meant. I would have told him they were way off the beam, but I wanted to talk to you first, get it straight. Well, sir, it's true. I don't. I want to stay this way. The man looked at Mary and then coughed embarrassly. What the hell, excuse me, kid, but I don't exactly get it. You saw the psychiatrist. Yes, sir. I'm not insane. Dr. Hortell can tell you. I didn't mean anything like that. Well, the man laughed nervously. I don't know what to say. You're still a cub, but you do swell work. A lot of good results. Lots of comments from the stations. But Mr. Poole won't like it. I know I know what you mean, Mr. Wilmus, but nothing can change my mind. I want to stay this way and that's all there is to it. But you'll get old before you're half through life. Yes, she would. Old, like the elders, wrinkled and brittle, unable to move right. Old. It's hard to make you understand, but I don't see why it should make any difference. Don't be getting me wrong now. It's not me, but you know, I don't own an planetary. I just work here. Mr. Poole likes to have things running smooth. And it's my job to carry it out. And as soon as everybody finds out, things won't run smooth. They'll be a big stink. The dames will start asking questions and talk. Will you accept my resignation then, Mr. Wilmus? Sure you won't change your mind. No, sir, I decided that a long time ago. I'm sorry now that I told mother or anyone else. No, sir, I won't change my mind. Well, I'm sorry, Mary. You've been doing awful swell work. Couple of years you could be centraled on one of the asteroids. The way you've been working. But if you should change your mind, they'll always be a job for you here. Thank you, sir. No hard feelings. No hard feelings. Okay then, you've got till March. And between you and me, I hope by then you've decided the other way. Mary walked back down the aisle, passed the rows of desks, passed the men and women, the handsome, model men, and the beautiful, perfect women. Perfect. All perfect. All looking alike. Looking exactly alike. She sat down again and took up her ruler and pen. Mary stepped into the elevator and descended several hundred feet. At the second level, she pressed a button and the elevator stopped. The doors opened with another button, and the doors to her unit was still another. This is cubrily sat on the floor by the TV, disconsel it and red eyed. Her blonde hair had come to slightly escue and a few strands hung over her forehead. You don't need to tell me, no one will hire you. Mary sat beside her mother. If only you hadn't told Mr. Wilmus in the first place, well, I thought he could be a little sensitive to you. The sounds from the TV grew louder. This is cubrily changed the channels and finally turned it off. What did you do today, mother? Mary smiled. Do? What can I do? Nobody will come over? I told you what would happen. Mother, they said you should be in the circuses. Mary went into another room. Mrs. cubrily followed. How are we going to live? Where does the money come from? This because you're stubborn on this crazy idea, crazy, crazy, crazy. Can I support both of us? They'll be firing me next. Why is this happening? Because of you, that's why nobody else on this planet ever refused the transformation. But you turned it down. You want to be ugly. Mary put her arms around her mother's shoulders. I wish I could explain, I tried so hard to. It isn't that I want to bother anyone or the daddy wanted me to. I just don't want the transformation. Mrs. cubrily reached into the pockets of her blouse and got a purple pill. She swallowed the pill. When the letter dropped from the shoot, Mrs. cubrily ran to snatch it up. She read it once silently. And smiled. Oh, I was afraid they wouldn't answer. But we'll see about this now. She gave the letter to Mary. Mrs. Zina cubrily unit 4.5.1D, levels 2.3, city, dear madam. In re your letter of December 3.36, we have carefully examined your complaint and consider that it requires stringent measures. Quite frankly, the possibility of such a complaint has never occurred to this department. And we therefore cannot make positive directives at the moment. However, due to the unusual qualities of the matter, we have arranged an audience at central dome. 8th level, 16th unit. January 337. 23 sharp. Dr. Elf Horell has been instructed to attend. You will bring the subjecting question. Yours, department F. Mary let the paper flutter to the floor. She walked quietly to the elevator and set it for level 3. When the elevator stopped, she ran from it, crying into her room. She thought and remembered and tried to sort out and put together. Daddy had said it. Grandpa had. The books did. Yes, the books did. She read until her eyes burned. And her eyes burned until she could read no more. Then Mary went to sleep softly without realizing it for the first time. But the sleep was not peaceful. She used Anne gentlemen. Said the young looking well-groomed man. This problem does not resolve easily. Dr. Horell here testifies that Mary cubrely is definitely not insane. Dr. Bhoinahan, Crian, and Fetters all verify this judgment. Dr. Prian asserts that the human organism is no longer so constructed as to create and sustain such an attitude through deliberate falsehood. Further, there is positively nothing in the structure of Mary cubrely which might suggest difficulties in transformation. There is evidence for all these statements. And yet we are faced with this refusal. What may I ask is to be done. Mary looked at the metal table. We have been in session far too long holding up far too many other pressing contingencies. That trouble on work, here we for example. We will have to straighten that out somehow. Throughout the rows of beautiful people, the mumbling increased. Mrs. Cubrely sat nervously tapping her shoe and running a comb through her hair. Mary cubrely, you have been given innumerable chances to reconsider, you know. Mary said, I know, but I don't want to. The beautiful people looked at Mary and laughed. Some shook their heads. The man threw up his hands. Little girl can you realize what an issue you have caused? The unrest, the wasted time. Do you fully understand what you have done? Enter galactic questions, hang fire, while you sit there, saying the same thing over and over. Doesn't the happiness of your mother mean anything to you? A slender, supple woman in the back row, cried. We want action. Do something. The man in the high stool raised his hand. None of that now, we must conform even though the question is out of the ordinary. He leaf through a number of papers on his desk, lean down and whispered into the ear of a strong blonde man. Then he turned to Mary again. And he smiled for the last time, do you reconsider, will you accept transformation? No! The man shrugged his shoulders. Very well then. I have here a petition signed by 2,000 individuals and representing all the stations of earth. They have been made aware of all the facts and have submitted the petition voluntarily. It's all so unusual, and I hope we won't have to, but the petition urges drastic measures. The mumbling rows. The petition urges that you shall upon final refusal be forced by law to accept the transformation and that an act of legislation shall make this universal and binding in the future. Three eyes were open wide. She stood and paused before speaking. Why, she asked loudly? The man passed a hand through his hair. Another voice from the crowd seems to be a lot of questions unanswered here and another sign the petition, Senator. All the voices. Sign it. Sign it. That why, Mary began to cry, the voice is stilled for a moment. Because, because. If you'd only tell me that, tell me. Why, it simply isn't being done. That's all. The greatest gift of all, and what if others should get the same idea? What would happen to us then, little girl? We'd be right back to the ugly, thin, fat, unhealthy looking race. We were ages ago. There can't be any exceptions. Maybe they didn't consider themselves so ugly. The mumbling began a new. That isn't the point, right, the man? You must conform. And the voice is cried. Yes, loudly. Until the man took up a pen and signed the papers on his desk. Cheers. A plos. Shouts. Mrs. Cuberley padded Mary on the top of her head. There, now, she said, happily, everything will be all right. You'll see, Mary. The transformation parlor covered the entire level, sprawling with its departments. It was always filled, and there was nothing to sign, and no money to pay, and people were always waiting in line. But today, the people stood aside, and there were still more looking in through the doors. TV cameras placed throughout the tape machines in every corner. It was filled, but not bustling as usual. Mary walked past the people, mother, and the men in back of her, following. She looked at the people. The people were beautiful, perfect, without a single flaw. All the beautiful people, all the ugly people staring out from bodies that were not theirs, walking on legs that had been made for them, laughing with manufactured voices, gesturing with shaped and fashioned arms. Mary walked slowly, despite the prodding, in her eyes, in her eyes, was a mounting confusion, a wide, wide wonderment. The reason was becoming less vague. The fuzzed edges were falling away now. Through all the horrible months, and all the horrible moments, the edges fell away. Now it was almost clear. She looked down at her own body, then at the walls, which reflected it. Flesh of her flesh, bone of her bone. All hers, made by no one, built by herself, or someone she did not know. Uneven kneecaps, making two grinning cherubs when they bent. One the old familiar rubbing together of fat, inner thighs, fat, unshaply, unsystematic Mary, but Mary. Of course, of course, this was what that he meant, and what grandpa and the books meant. What they would know if they had read the books, or heard the words, the good, reasonable words. No words that signified more, much more than any of this. The understanding heaped up with every step. Where are these people, Mary asked, have to herself? What has happened to them, and don't they miss themselves? These manufactured things? She stopped suddenly. Yes, that is the reason. They have all forgotten themselves. A curvacious woman stepped forward and took Mary's hand. The woman's skin was tinted dark. Chipped and sculptured bone into slender, rhythmic lines. Electrically created carriage, stance, made, turned out. All right young lady, we will begin. They guided Mary to a large, curved leather seat. On the top of a long silver pole, a machine lowered itself. Tiny bulbs glowed to life, and cells began to click. The people stared. Slowly, I picked your form to paw on the screen in the machine. Bob's directed at Mary, then redirected into the machine. Wheels turning. Buttons ticking. The picture was complete. Would you like to see it? Mary closed her eyes tight. It's really very nice. The woman turned to the crowd. Oh yes, there's a great deal to be salvaged. You'd be surprised. A great deal. We'll keep the nose, and I don't believe the elbows will have to be altered at all. Mrs. Cuberley looked at Mary in smile. Now it isn't so bad as you thought, isn't she said? The beautiful people looked. Cameras turned. Tables wound. You'll have to excuse us now only the machines allowed. Only the machines. The people filed out. Mary saw the room in the mirror. Saw things in the rooms. The faces and the bodies that had been left. The woman and the machines and the old young men standing about, adjusting, readying. Then she looked at the picture in the screen. And screamed. A woman of medium-hide stared back at her. A woman with a curved body and thin legs, silver hair, pop-a-dorn, cut short. Little sensuous lips, small breasts, flat stomach, unblemished skin. A strange, strange woman, no one had ever seen before. The nurse began to take Mary's clothes off. Jough, the woman said, come, look at this, will you? Not once or bad in years. Amazing that we can keep anything at all. I have some men put his hands in his pockets. Pretty bad, all right. Be still child, stop making those noises. You know perfectly well nothing is going to hurt. But what will you do with me? That was all explained to you. No, no with me. Me. Oh, you mean the cast sauce. The usual? I don't know exactly, someone takes care of it. I want me, Mary, cried. Not that. She pointed at the screen. Her chair was wheeled into the semi-dark room. She was naked now, and the men lifted her to a table. The surface was like glass, black, filmed, a big machine hung above. Straps, clamps pulling, stretching limbs apart. The screen with the picture brought in. The men and the women. More women now. Dr. Hortell was sitting in the corner, sitting with his legs crossed, shaking his head. Mary began to cry above the hum of the mechanical things. Shhh, by gracious such a racket. Just think about your job waiting for you, and all the friends you'll have, and how nice everything will be. No more trouble now. The big machine hurtling downward. Where will I find me, Mary screamed? When it's all over. A long needle slid through rough flesh, and the beautiful people gathered around the table. They turned on the big machine. The end of the beautiful people.
